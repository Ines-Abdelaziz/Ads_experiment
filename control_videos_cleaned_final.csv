What kind of yummy food has been prepared this time? Wow, is that a huge Oreo? It looks great. I want to try it. Wow, it's chocolate. But it's really uncomfortable to eat. Okay, let's leave it.

[Music] This time I want pancakes. Oh, easy as pie. I'm the best at pancakes. No way. I'll make the best pancakes. I allow you to be the best after me. Uh, how to cook pancakes? Well, improvisation is my everything. Now, we will mix in a blender everything. And well, something will turn out. What to mix then? Like this. Some milk. Um, what else? Maybe some flour. I hope that's enough. I actually don't have anymore. Well, let's turn it on. Oh goodness, everything is flying all over. I'll have to turn it off. Somebody stop this flower storm. It seems to have stopped. I have flour everywhere. But the dough is ready. Now we should bake it. I think it's pretty cool. And there's a real fight between grandma and the chef. I have everything under control. I'm starting to bake right now. What with this frying pan? Seriously, that's so funny. This is what you should be using. This is a professional pan for professionals. Oh, whatever. I'm starting to bake. Pouring some oil so that nothing burns. You have oil like in the frying pan. The oil dispenser has been invented a long time ago. Well, the ideal amount and my pancakes will be not only delicious, but also healthy. What do you have there? I'll win. No, I'm going to win. Look what I can do. You haven't seen that? I'm pretty sure. What? You think it's impressive? Now, look at this. This is real experience. Perfect. The perfect landing. Yeah, it's pretty cool. Are you guys fighting or what's going on? What's the matter with you today? Um, I've already made my huge pancake. Now I'll just bail it off from the frying pan. Oh, pancake, wait, don't fly away. Oops. Right in the trash. What a nightmare. I've been doing it all for nothing. A brilliant idea came to me. I will improve my pancakes. I will cook them in the shape of a heart. Perfect. I hope the baby will appreciate it. I put all my love into these pancakes. Adding a little syrup, berries, and some hearts. Perfect. What do you think, chef? It's so funny that my stomach is literally hurting. Look at my hands. I'm pouring two chocolate paste into the mold at the same time. When the baby picks it up, it'll be delighted. Huh, that's so cool. Wow, it looks cool. But guys, stop fighting. The baby will decide on everything. Oh, they have such beautiful pancakes. What about me? Oh, I actually have an idea. I have a donut. It's round and plump. But we can flatten it. There you go. A pancake. Wait, where is it? There's my pancake. Well, it's better. Wow, everything looks great except this one. What is that? A pan. Have to tear it off. Oh, it's kind of scary to even try. I don't want that. Wow. Wow. What cute pancakes. Granny definitely did it. We need to try it soon. A very familiar taste. Delicious pancakes from the best grandma. Thanks. That's perfect. Wow. Wow. What's here? We need to lift it up. So beautiful. Chef, you're genius. We need to try it soon. Yeah, it's delicious. But what to choose? Grandma or chef? Choose me. Not me. I'm the best. I choose grandma. Yeah, she has the best pancakes. Me? Oh, hooray. Victory, chef. Did you get that? I'm the queen. Guys, you urgently need to hide everywhere. Freddy catches up with you. Get under the boxes, girls. There are so many of them here, and they will definitely not find them. Girls, be careful. That's it. He's coming. Hi, Freddy. There's definitely no one here. I think he's right behind my box. Goodies. How scared am I? I think this box is hiding somebody. Well, you're going to get from me now. Ah, here you go for mocking me. [Music] And now my signature jump. Here you go. Uh, I hear your voice. Here you go. Uh, why is it peeking or something? It was just a chicken. Well, okay, girls. It's okay. Freddy found a chicken, but you still need to be even quieter. Hm. But there are so many options for hiding here that a bomb can help me. It will definitely find a bully. Now I have to choose where my bomb will go. Uh, I think that's the box. I think I should look out. Huh? Freddy isn't here. Maybe he left. Well, then I'm going to try to peek and sneak out of here. Uh-oh. I almost got busted. Careful. Careful. Just like that. Oh no. Peekab-boo. Who lives in this house? I have a surprise for you. My Bob wants to say hi to you. Here you go. I'll move away so it doesn't hurt me. Oh no, it's a bomb. What did I do? What did I do? Okay, let's try again. Oh, it worked. Hooray. Where is the bomb? Why didn't the box fly to the moon? Strange. The bomb usually doesn't fail. What did you do to it? Hi, Freddy. And I found your bomb here. Will you take it? So, you put it out. Give me my bomb back here. I need it. This is not your property. Come on. Here you go. Great. Now, I need to lit it up again. I'm going to resurrect you now. Ready? Take it now. Oh, thank you. Wait a minute. Did you light it up again? Damn. What am I supposed to [Music] do? It was easy. Minus one. There are still a couple of people left and I already have an idea how to get rid of other bullies. Oh  Ah, here is another one. I'm going to pierce one of the boxes along with a scoundrel who was playing with me. Oh no. Knock knock. Who's there? Maybe Freddy already left. Oh no. Here's right there. Oh, that's definitely someone in the box. I need to introduce myself with my stakes. Well, hold on bully. Let's take two at once. I think that's not enough. The box is too big. Let's try another one. Help me. I'm so scared. Well, and finally the last one. Ah, it hurts. Was it Miley? I'm falling. Catch me. I found you. You've lost. Do you know what they do to losers? Great. There are three more left. Wonderful. I should find him as soon as possible. I've already got an idea. Is he gone? I'm back. I'm going to knock down all the boxes when I ride my moped. This will be the fastest and the best option. You just need to exhilarate to catch the bully for sure. They'll find out what kind of offending Freddy I am. Well, it's been a long time since I've written a moped. Let's go. Wait, it's something wrong with it. Ah, damn it. It's broken. I have to find the solution. Well, let's see. There are a lot of wires here. Uh, even more than in me. Got it. No working with hands. Ooh, thank you. Now I'm going to fix it. Maybe there are other instruments. Oh, thank you. A chainsaw. Perfect. I'm down with a chainsaw now. I'm going to put things in order here. H I definitely need something. Wo! Chocolate? Wait, chocolate. Freddy, this chocolate bar is for you. We want to make peas. Oops. It seems we only made him angrier. And fear all the hooligans. I'm going to catch you all now. No girls, he's going to destroy us. Let's go. Where are you running off to? I already know where you are. You definitely could hide from me right now. Oh, there's the bully. Wait, what? Oh, here you are. I'm coming after you. Wait, where are you? Ah, not here either. Ah, where are you? You're only making Freddy angrier. We're here, Freddy. Well, now you've made me furious. That's it. I'll catch you all right now, you scoundrels. Where is my machine? Now I need to play it. This animal will definitely find the right box. Let it be this one. Now you're going to get it. Oh no. Help me. Did I get it? Yay. H. Who was under [Music] there? I can't wait to see who it is. Hi, Freddy. What's up? I'm a little smeared. Only two more left. Oh no, poor Phoebe. Ooh, there's definitely someone hiding around under this box. I need to listen. I can definitely hear the chatter of teeth trembling with fear. It's time to deal with this bully, too. Oh, I only need to hide somewhere else. Maybe here. No, Quentyn's here. I'll try another place. I just heard someone walking. I need to identify the target. Ooh, there's definitely someone in this box. Now I'm going to run away and rush straight into the box with all my might. The bully will regret that. Oh no. Falling. I'm sorry, Freddy. Are you all right? I can't stick my head out. Ow. The head is disconnected again. I can't see anything. Whoa. Freddy's head is here.

Every Tiger and Panther you meet. Your top speed is measured by emotional damage per hour. To be honest, it's not worth using. IT1. The IT1 is that guy who shows up to a knife fight with a missile launcher. If you miss your shot, you're basically dead if you're not hiding behind anything. But if you do hit someone, it's almost a guaranteed kill. Rate of 501, you've got a gun that can shred if it ever decides to aim at what you're pointing at. The crew sits in the open like they're sunbathing, and the armor might as well be wrapping paper. The Brada is the kind of vehicle you unlock and instantly regret.

One of the members, the one with the good hair on the left, Patrick Dyer Wolf, cousin of our own Boo Shabi, who is under the weather hopefully on the men. Best wishes, Boo. We hope to see you back here soon. In the meantime, it's the Cubs versus Dodgers part three versus Tokyo, Japan, then Chavez Ravine, and now here in Chicago. It's the Chicago Cubs taking on the Los Angeles Dodgers. Game one of two here from Wrigley Field. with Imanaga making his sixth start. Then against quality competition, all all six opponents or all five previous opponents 13-9 or better. Four hitless against the Dodgers over in Tokyo on opening day and the Cubs are 26-8 in his starts. That's a 765 winning percentage. So here's a fun one. Just like in Tokyo, pitch one, game one of the 2025 season. It is Shi Otani at the plate and Shota Imanaga on the mound. First pitch. It's off the glove of Gage Workman and it goes into left field. Show Otani reaches base. And this this has got all kinds of funky spin on it. Looks like a routine play, but I I think this ball took a crazy hop on engage. You can see the way he had to lunge for it at the last and out to center. PCA makes the catch. Utani being the big exception. Liner to left. Plays it on a hop. He bets Hernandez Freeman. Cod on a miss. Strike three. Shota gets the best of Freddy Freeman. Strike out number one. And it's a big one for out number [Applause] two. just goes back to that slide ball and hits the swing and miss in the zone. Spin in the zone. Oh, one hit out to center. PCA back at the wall and Tommy Edmond does it again. Wow. Yeah. With all the firepower they have in their lineup, you wouldn't think you'd be most concerned with Tommy Edmond, but that has been the case in his career against the Cubs. This is the third time he's gotten showed. He hit two against him in a game last [Applause] year. Perseverance from Dustin Mang down the right field line. That's a base hit. It's off the wall and half the second. And it's a leadoff double here in the first. A chance to answer right away after the Dodgers put that three spot up in the top of the inning. And a good start here for Ian Hat were 110 mph. Tucker into center. Base hit. H stops at third. The Cubs backto back hits here against Dustin May to begin the bottom of the first inning. Tucker's off. No throw to second and Kyle Tucker steals second. Wrigleyfield against the Diamondbacks. Sea hits it in the left. Pah back. He can't make the catch. Hits off the wall. H scores. Tucker scores. Two-run double. Sea Suzuki. And the Cubs are on the board of the [Applause] first. And they're hanging out some ropes here. The contact against Dustin May it's been most impressive again that one finds the center of the strike zone and say jumps all over it not getting a whole lot of sank on his sanker I had moonwalk on homie 100 mph guy tapper to first and steps off first and retires Bush but say at a serve hitless on Sunday. Dansby in the air center field. Edmond back at the wall. Jumps up. Can't make the catch. Jumps into center field. Tying run scores. Dansby to third. RBI triple. It's a three-3 game. [Applause] [Applause] 2-1 popped up left field shallow. It falls in for a base hit. PCA heading to second gets there standing up. It's four to three Cubs. Amaya. Another blooper into right field. That ball's in for a base hit. Pet Cro Armstrong scores. Miguela RBI single. Five to three comes in the [Applause] first. Little bit of this, a little bit of that. Just need the long ball. He really cranks on that slider right off the end of the bat. Hernandez and Hernandez in pursuit, but nobody can get there. And PCA cruises on home. That's pulled out to left. Half back at the wall. That is wiggle. All flying tonight here at Wrigley Field. Annie Pahz third homer of the year. Solo shot. Cubs lead cut to one here in the second. Certainly got help but certainly did not need help. He crushed that baseball. So he did try to go in. P has cut it [Applause] off. Two two caugh on a miss. Strike three. Hit the third. Workman fields that one. Fires across the diamond. One [Applause] away. Hernandez. Line drive caught by Dansby. One or two of those clubs is probably going to be stay at home. That's a great pitch. Shota freezes Freddy Freeman. [Applause] The payoff just misses. Here's the pitch. Got [Applause] it. Swinging a miss. Strike three. Strike out number 200 for Shota Imanaga in a Cubs uniform. He Ks Kik Hernandez. Two outs. again. He goes back to that splitter and it's up. Actually, not a great pitch, but a great result. Big leg kick. First and second, two outs. 02 count on the crowd on their feet. High left. H makes the catch and Sha gets out of it in the fourth. One, two, swing and a miss. Strike three. Shota strikes out again. One away. And again, he goes for that slide ball to get the job done. And this one diving off that outside corner. And a feeble hack at it there by the new daddy. Two. That's it. Well, deep right. Hernandez. watches but by Pete Cro [Applause] Armstrong. PCA annihilated that baseball. Two-run shot deep into the bleachers. It's seven to four Cubs. [Applause] First home run allowed by Dustin May this year. They'd like to work up in the zone with a fast ball. The PCA. That one got down into his happy zone and man did he unload at this juncture. But we haven't. Smith hits it out the left field. That's back. That's into the bleachers. Council hoping to get Shota through this sixth inning. He's got Brad Keller up. We'll see what the plan is going forward. Smith circles the bases for the third time this [Applause] year. Talk about his splitter sometimes cutting on him. Looks like that's what happened there. Muny hits it in the air to right. Tucker is back at the wall. Jumps up. He caught [Applause] it. Hold your breath moment there for Shota as that ball almost gets out of here. And a nice play by Tucker twisting and turning but ultimately hauling this ball in. The Dodgers make a bid for another home run. Craig Council's going to make a move. Not easy when you have to deal with the wall obviously and the basket on a windy night at Wrigley. And the crowd applauding Shota Ianaga for his effort tonight in line for the win. And this pitching change is brought to you by Lakeside Bank. Lakeside Bank. It's about time. Throws the slider 45% of the time. That line drive to left of the base hit sit. Second hit for Rian left and a base hit for Sei. It goes through the legs of PZA heading to second. The throw is late. 1-1 out towards left field. PZ in makes the catch. That tags up. Here's the throw home. The tag. He's [Applause] safe. Rogers contemplating a challenge here. Will Smith thought he got him. They're going to take a look. Los Angeles is challenging to stay safe at home plate. All right, they're taking a second look. A second opinion is always a good idea. Get yours at Northwestern Medicine. Katie, what were your initial thoughts? I thought he was safe, but it was really close. [Applause] Yeah. And they, you know, they're going to get a lot of looks at it back in New York. I don't know if there's enough there to overturn. Have to review. The call on the field is overturned. The runner is out. Los [Applause] Angeles by Keller. 3-2. Can't take the umpire to task over that one. Another walk. One, two, roll over to third. It's off the glove of Workman. One run scores. Rest moves station to station. It's a seven to six game. And Freeman lines it to left. Base hit for Freddy Freeman. Two-run score. Freeman heads to second. The throw. It's late and the Dodgers take the [Applause] lead. That's it to right. Tucker towards the corner makes the catch. It's deep enough to score a run. Fernandez score. Sack fly. Nine to7 Dodgers. Two-1 Smith in the air to left half back and he plays it off the wall. Freeman scores. Will Smith RBI double. Huge night for him. It's 10 to7 Dodgers. went with that slider and it backed up on him. Just sat there right in the middle of the strike [Applause] zone. Tell you what, there have been some loud noises in this game from both sides. A lot of hard contact. Third and run scored, fourth and runs batted in. 2-2. That's it. Well, right field way back. It's [Applause] gone. Kyle Tucker, you are the man. Two-run shot. Seventh of the year. Comes within one. It's a 109 game. It's not fair to expect to expect a player to come through every single time he comes up, but that's the sense you get with Tucker. He took that real bad hack at the slider by a couple pitches previous. Almost like he was setting him up. Throw me another one. See what kind of hack I put on it. What a game. This home run is brought to you by Hefty, Hefty, Hefty, ultra strong, ultra low price. This slider stays middle in and then it goes out. Just a little casual back flip to celebrate. Amaya into center field. Edmonds back at the wall. Jumps up. It's in the basket. We are [Applause] tied. Pop us up the Gamaya. It's 10 to [Applause] 10. That deserves a curtain call, folks. Two outs in the ninth. Miguel delivers. What a ball game. What did we do to deserve this classic? Talk about how that wind had died down. But this one did not need a lot of help. He leaned on it. Lean back and watch it fly. Ball third strike. Miguel Maya extends it. Ground ball towards first. Diving play made underhand the first and they got him. [Applause] Yes, we [Applause] can. O2 hit the first step off first. Scoreless city quarter know what Davis will make his Dodger debut here. called up a couple of days ago from Triple A last year. Nine appearances with the Rockies, 20 innings and a 575 ERA. Making his Dodgers debut here in the big leagues. 10-10 bottom 10. Vidal Bruhan at second represents a potential game-winning [Applause] run. Half ground ball into right field for a base hit. Bruhan rounds third throw home. It's late. Cubs win.

getting ready hi guys welcome back to my channel and today we are starting to Vlog off in Zurich we are currently staying with cute and I'm currently making her matcha latte with my signature breakfast bowl because I really wanted her to try it I'm not going to lie making this trip here I was pretty nervous because with the recent plane crashes she has this like electric whisker thingy that was my first time using it actually did spill just a little bit so the previous day we did some grocery shopping and the produce here they're good quality except that I just couldn't read the ingredients so I had to have q translate good morning y'all first full day in Zer today we're going to be going to interlockin I want to keep try my signature breakfast M blueberry is very very sweet I like it wow I'm going to start doing this what so fast too you tell me the blueberry is really good I currently on the train and it is so packed and we're sitting in reserved seats right now train is supposed to be 2 hours I'll update you guys as I go okay guys I like crashed out do not sleep with your contacts because once you do my eyes right now are so dry okay currently at burn Capital Switzerland I'm whispering because there's a lot of people here have one more hour left that's the Vibes I'll see you guys [Laughter] [Music] later yeah if I want that or if I want the one that sound a little bit of a [Music] yesterday look at [Music] this say something [Music] see [Music] get this is where they filmed Crash Landing into you it's like that 1K drama guess it's a little cold I'm not going to lie but it's like at least it's not raining like the sky is blue the ocean is literally blue we just walk in you was some who booked this place for us and you can see it's like quite spacious I was wearing like these platform boots and I switched out of them thank God I bought my sneakers when we landed keute was like you want paragliding and I'm like huh I H think that she's a dog I'm just a cat I'm an indoor cat like to be on ground hi guys we're currently heading out of the hotel it just feels like it's straight out of a green screen guys like look at this so quiet there's nobody here you definitely do see Taurus but it's not too much we are here in March I don't know if it gets warmer there's going to be more people H I just think we're so lucky with this weather currently 36 de but it's not windy the sun is hitting right on you I don't even think I hear birds huh you hear birds no oh I do if I really focus I do currently staying at the Strand Hotel we walked into the restaurant and then we were trying to find reception the lady was like where are you going and we're like we're looking for a reception and she's like that's the toilet babes I think the best trips are usually like the ones where you have absolutely no plan on what to do so we're just going to walk around I know Q wants us to have a plan XYZ location anything you would like to add yeah so I would love to like hit xyc spot but honestly have some therapeutic walk into nature watch some grass and water watch some ducks chilling out there where are the Ducks there they there two of them like us weather is good the sun is out come ask for more yeah let's go let's go look at her look at her running look at her running oh my God guys you have to pay to like go over there even if you don't have coins you can pay it digitally this is like top TI your nature like the sky is blue there's clean Ducks down there there's Mountain there's flowers there's beautiful houses like why do you need a plant you don't need a plant oh my God guys one of the primary reasons I even ever came to switherland the first time is because I wanted to pet the cattles but the first time I was in Zer where can I find that in Zer but guys I think I see animals right now I literally called it Uber to get there because we missed our bus and we're only here for a day so I'm like we cannot waste time and I see donkeys my Uber is literally coming 8 minutes I'm making up this hike they're freaking real oh my God those are real those are real like [ __ ] donkeys that's a sheep that's a ram a goat no that's a donkey no there's a donkey and a goat it has horns what wait is it oh wait wait no you're right never mind I thought it was a sheep it's actually a donkey dude it's like looking at me can't believe this real that one's like not moving inside that is all cows this brown one is significantly smaller than the white one the Ubers here are very expensive I do not recommend calling it unless you're in like a desperate situation because uh in some areas like the hotel that we're at it only comes by hourly anyways seat inside this Uber is so interesting like I don't know if this is like a European thing because I remember in the UK they also has seats like this I'm borrowing Q scarf because my scarf is wool and I'm wearing a black trench and I always have to do use a limp roller and this is cashmere and so it doesn't get on me I have body lotion you want to B you don't want huh what you it started off with like her being like I want Italian food do you want Indian food yeah do you want Japanese food food do you want Chinese food the first time I came here we went to like a Asian Chinese restaurant and it was not good you guys can correct me if I'm wrong I don't know if I trust the Asian food in Europe but the white people food white people food is good yeah the white people food is good all right shall we walk in the city or next to the river where are we right now right now we're like in the city we go to the river call me lazy call me whatever but I do realize that when I travel I tend to not really make plans especially in an area that I'm just not too familiar with every single Street I cross that's a street I've never been on Sky I've never seen before the mountains is also new to me the godum trees are also new to me you see all these trees they're just all in one place and the trunks are freaking thick I just feel these trees like belong in the forest like what do you mean it's like right here and something that I do realize is that in Switzerland like people are very very active like people felt like birds and then here we were just going down into the City and we passed by this really really cute little gift shop I usually like to go to gift shops When I visit uh different countries because I like to kill magnets so here I did buy interlock and magnet and I also was checking out the toy they were a little crazy in price so I was like I'mma put that down and pretend I'd never touched and this toy right here reminded me of childhood I don't remember what the name it made me feel so nostalgic though the sun was setting most of the time we were definitely just like strolling around just depends on what type of traveler you are but the scenery and everything it was beautiful I just loved looking at architecture even when I'm in the states like if I'm in New York or if I'm in Boston I love just going around this is my sounds so creepy but I don't mean it in a creepy way but I love just like house watching like I love like looking at people's houses and just admiring it seeing color they are what type of shapes they are I do realize European houses like the windows are just longer they look like art pieces it was so relaxing to just walk around you just see a house and then far down you just see a mountain you just see glaciers also tip tip tip if you guys come here bring comfortable shoes on my first few days here I was wearing like these platform heel boots and honestly they're not like uncomfortable but nothing can truly be a pair of sneakers I know beauty is pain but sometimes it's not worth it sometimes you just can't enjoy the scenery as much everyone here wear sneakers just very practical shoes afterwards we came into this really cute little store um I didn't really know how to play this instrum but cute was like you have to hit each and one of them separately you just have to Glide the instrument down it's really cute just visit little shops even though I think the owners might find us a little annoying cuz we didn't buy anything it was getting late and if you know q and I when we're together our quality time is eating so today we were craving pizza but we saw this one restaurant okay she looked very bougie but honestly prices wise I think it was very similar to like other food in Switzerland the prices of food here is very comparable to the prices in New York I really wanted a Bata Pizza half of it with no prawns and half of it with prawns because I'm vegetarian and then we order a little salad I was thinking of ordering spaghetti but we were thinking that maybe that's too much I did order some white wine because these days I want to try out different sorts of white wine and find out which one's my favorite and I could never get over the bread here apparently you're supposed to put a little bit of salt into the olive oil and it is a game changer and the pizza was honestly so yummy it was so crisp it wasn't too oily it tastes healthier anyways that's a wrap on dinner and it was very yummy to go back to like the hotel I checked the bus oh my God the last bus is at 8:00 the next bus comes in 10 minutes so if we miss this one it's done my God we have to rush right now and I felt so bad because like I was rushing the waiter to get like the check if you don't give me this check you up I'm not getting [Music] home okay guys we're going to give you a room tour okay so this is our little room that we're only staying for a night but honestly very spacious this is like one small carry-on bag is like where we went out at and this is the heater itself when we just came back we literally had the door open so it's so damn cold inside and it has like a lot of space and I like that they give you a mirror and then there's a TV and there's a desk I've never seen this before one bed but it's two separate and then in here is the bathroom it's pretty nice actually what do they have they have towels and 225 a night oh it's actually pretty expensive it is a touristy area since people come here cuz of the K drama left the door open so like he is [ __ ] blaming me but she didn't remite me [ __ ] okay we were both in this room she was saying that she was in the bathroom but I'm like guys just look at the distance from the bathroom to the door this apparently is a heater and I'm just leaning against it and I think Q is planning on sleeping with her jacket Q lend me like this PJ thing I may just wear it tomorrow productive she said so productive because like when I wake up I'm just going to be ready to go D you you position the phone it's like not going through my Jacko you are so thick right now take it off who made me take off guys she stinks with her really doesn't but she makes such a big deal so pissed why do you mean you haven't borrow my sweat I'm L going to wear what you're not going to wear you feel it I do know how the heck is the heat even coming out this is my pj guys I think about wearing it out but then I tried it on and I it's so cute it's like Mountain Vibes good morning everyone look at this beautiful view I just did my skincare and it's so cold out but this view is crazy w oh it's like pink orange and what blue what it's a little chilly but it's not like super cold but imagine waking up to this in like the spring or the summer it's so pretty bro last night I slept okay let me just give you guys like a brief review of the hotel so far I would say that the bed itself it's pretty damn soft remember how it was like super cold that was our fault afterwards it was very warm the ground of this bathroom is very warm and I like how hot the water gets the sink right here it doesn't drain and you have to manually lift the drain the Wi-Fi not so good Outlets all work fine he will saying that the breakfast is really good so we're going to get breakfast later there's no really any restaurants near us currently it's like 8:00 breakfast starts at 8:30 we're going to probably leave here around like 10:00 cuz we want to catch the 10:30 bus I just finished getting ready and I'm literally taking in this view right now honestly when I woke up in the hotel room I was like there's nothing too special going on this is what we paid for I don't know if you see that there's like a little boat right there you know those water bottles that have like the mount on there that literally just looks like what it is like you see that like that mountain right there it's so pretty I'm sorry if I'm showing you the same frame over and over again I just generally cannot get over this View and [Music] [Music] look [Music] [Music] [Music] off [Music] wait [Music] oh my [Music] God ew don't pet AR you allergic okay all right hello do you have like milk no we don't got milk this is a butcher shop what Ty of me do you want do you have cheese it's a butcher shot oh I want like a rip eye about that yeah you look good in this Frame the butcher with good face cars when I go into stores to buy like the cows I never have to pay cuz I go I just don't want to sell to you yeah I want to buy you though F you bye bye bye bye see you later it's my freedom of to stand here my freedom this is shut down bye oh bye what is this big girl doing she w is that you don't hit your head she's coming out of the Butcher Store oh I told you karma for me not selling you me I saw it [Music] check can you guys guess what we're heading to right now okay so we switched trains multiple times because we had to do some transfers but we are going to Basel let me tell you what is my favorite restaurant of all in Switzerland it's tibits Q was the one who bought me to this place like the first time I came to swi out she bought me to Tippets and I freaking love it for those who don't know it's basic vegetarian Buffet they weigh it by the pound it's not like a buffet where it's like an all you can eat buffet y'all did you guys see that teramis Su right there that sh was busing now she was so good also the top is made out of yogurt I'm pretty sure and they just have so many different desserts I just don't know how they come up with it it's not like boring white people like they season it and some of these actually look like meat dishes K is not vegetarian but she told me how she and her girlfriends will come here so basically at the end they weigh it by the pound and you can also order a drink and with each meal it comes with a piece of bread the total of the two plates right here was 45 Franks later I would get like a second plate of savory food and then I would end with with desserts so I just will not find this in the state so I'm I'mma eat Tippets is like the only place that I would like I will pick out I just eat as much as I can I do not care it looked like when I eat this I will be the happiest person in the world and godamn I was right New York City come on can we make a tibits here too I'm not really picky about food but uh I do have things I do not like it's olives it's just olives all around it doesn't matter which country is in it just tastes like a whole bunch of salt water in my mouth and there was like this one patty thing that literally pulls it looks like mate and it was so yummy anyways now we're going to go cruise around the city guys I've been seeing so many Claire's I don't even see that many Claire's into the states like Claire's is so popular like back in like Middle School Claire's was like a big deal I can't get over the trams here they're actually on ground cuz I'm just so used to like seeing trains going underground so seeing them like being so close to people is actually kind of crazy oh my god did I tell you we're currently in bosil we're heading to downtown and later we're going to go to an art museum apparently they say this is the longest river in Europe so that's pretty interesting all this ground is like Cobblestone um I don't really much of a hike here mentioned that this is a scene that I must see so you better go see it I was like no I don't want to do it shoes I highly recommend this longest river in Europe huh how many countries does it run down five Europe is well connected see these days I still don't know what's considered a pond what's considered a lake what's consider a river ocean a sea you're looking at me but I'm like I don't know how to explain that either anyways okay we're going to hike up that's let's go that's the vibe so right now we're just going to go so the first Sunday of every month museums have free entrance they can like explore all the museums for free and pay like $2 if you're an adult it's free yeah okay this might be the craziest Museum I have ever been to so this museum has like a lot of animals a lot of these sculptures they don't really put a fence around it that just shows you how how much they trust their citizens honestly because imagine this in the state it'll be vandalized like people will ruin it but guys one of my biggest question is are these oh my God come on come on they these are sculptures right they look so real okay are these sculptures or are these real like when am I ever going to get this close to a wolf or when am I ever going to get this close to an otter right but these binocular things were pretty cool it felt like I was like a researcher in the wild looking into animals except that that will never be me okay let's explore the rest of this Museum okay that's via and that's the mega anteron via is like out in the wild I don't know how she's going to survive I can't bike I can't swim she's going to Incline walk what's that this is like a dinosaur no G foro it's a big elephant have you ever like um ride on one no no we should go to tan and do that I watch you do it I'm going to go there to eat mango sticky rice that's via and that's mammo mammo and Via what is that 12 feet no idea it's like this big even like running will not help you're going to squash me like a watermelon eaters I wonder looks like a plk eater what are you I'm probably that one be why they include a human skeleton in there oh maybe they're trying to show size comparison that's a giraffe that's huge [Music] B [Music] [Music] I see how long [Music] [Music] most people are sitting outside nobody's sitting inside I hope you can hear me just like music playing after grocery shopping we're going to head back and I'm going to make c one of my signature plates it's going to be yummy I've actually never tried hamus Switzerland before so I'm excited it's always so crispy on the outside and so soft on the inside like you can just tell what it's made out of and it's so nice usually when I go to certain places food is not the number one thing that comes to my mind that I want to buy can I bring bread into the country it's like so obvious that I'm the Foreigner here maybe just because I'm just Asian nobody is sitting inside I think like one table who's sitting inside everyone's sitting outside because it's like 51° it's honestly the weather where you should be sitting outside but also guys I posted on my Instagram story European men are just a little different okay oh my God I hate to admit this lowy he was cute so I left ASAP and anyways here I did some grocery I consider grocery shopping in other countries like a cultural experience you know even in the states it's like a mall it is retail therapy for me except it's grocery shopping so this clip you can see how I'm dealing with the potatoes first potatoes take a long time to cook in the oven I read online there were like you can just cut the potatoes up and just put it in the air fryer we put her in the air fryer for like 15 minutes something that is very necessary for all my place is the broccolini and the tofu currently I am back in the States I am back in New York the please just do not hit the same with my carrots that I put in the oven in New York they taste really hard but with the ones in Switzerland with the same amount of time it tasted so soft in the states the barata is gooey in Switzerland it had like a pulling texture and guys I found some purple tomatoes and I freaking loved it so we didn't have any like spray oil so uh yeah I was oiling up the um veggies and so because my hands are so oily I asked Q to sprinkle on the salt oats here in Europe they don't soak up all the water and then overnight I would see that the oats is still kind of watering it was the same at the interlockin hotel like I noticed the oats was kind of watery and Q mentioned maybe in the states we put salt so the food is now ready and uh Q is not a fan of the burnt uh broccolini and low key I don't even know if that's good for you because I like my broccolini a little burnt okay and this smoked tofu is so good so we also did buy drinks I bought like some Plum juice because I wanted to try the juicer but um anyways let's dig in M this is so good we tast different too M if these on mustard is so salty tomato here very sweet oh the radishes I'm excited so crunchy it's good right this tastes better than the one you make in the stage yeah the ingredients is just fresh um I apologize if this Vlog ended super abruptly because actually there were 20 minutes of footage left I don't think I can get it done in time for it to be posted tomorrow because uh this week I was also editing the first episode of my podcast which is my second Channel if any of you guys miss my journal entries I will be posting on my second Channel editing that took a lot a lot of time basically there will be a part two to the Switzerland Vlog I wanted to put it into one video instead of making you

it doesn't even feel like I'm in Vietnam anymore holy crap [Music] hey guys and welcome to Hanoi the beautiful capital of Vietnam so it's our first time in the country and today marks our first full day here in the city of Hanoi so we're staying in the old quarter a pretty popular area to say if it's your first time and guys let me tell you staying in this area makes it seem like we've been transported back in time and I mean that in the most positive way possible such a vibrant area and the hustle and bustle is unreal anyways let's start this day off with some authentic Vietnamese cuisine let's [Music] go so we're now seated and the server actually gave us a recommendations list to make it easier for customers so apparently this this this this and this is their most popular can we get the buncha we'll get the fried spring rolls Vietnamese pancake and beef fall thank you very much so we got four dishes we got the fried pork the fried spring rolls we've got Vietnamese pancake and then obviously we're in Vietnam we got the fa first official meal here in Vietnam we're so excited okay so we were just having conversation with our server she was actually giving us a lot of recommendations because it is their winter time here in Vietnam which we did not know we were like actually shocked when we landed because it was quite chilly it's so crazy because we were just in Thailand last week and it was so hot there I'm pretty sure it's their winter time there as well but it was still so hot so we were really surprised at how chilly it was here in Vietnam considering Thailand and Vietnam are so close to each other oh my gosh than so good wo thank you very much I didn't know the serving was this massive and since it is our first official meal here in Vietnam I just had to go for [Music] it all right let's get the be B try let's try the [Music] B it's not as flavorful but it's still really good ant's going in with the fried spring roll that's like one of ant's favorite food I just love the sauce that comes with it I I think I just love the sauce really good pretty flavorful so we're going to give the Vietnamese pancake a try this one right [Music] here the thing I taste the most is the mint and the coriander the mint is super strong but wow that's really good all right so we're going to give the traditional fried pork a try with the verelli this is what we're used to back home so vermicelli fried pork and vegetables pour some fish sauce on top oh my god dude the flavor of that meat is insane that's the way they marinate it I think out of all the dishes that we got this is definitely my favorite the flavor is so good [Music] all right so we just finished eating food was great and the service was even better I recommend it's pretty [Music] good so after lunch we decided decided to make our way to train Street which is not that far from where we were eating so we're cently here at a cafe look at the vibe here though so there's the train tracks and all of these right here are all coffee shops SL restaurants there's a lot of people here now waiting so we've ordered our egg coffee apparently egg coffee is very popular here in Vietnam so we're going to give it a try I've never heard of egg coffee ever yeah I know thick oh I'm pretty sure we're supposed to mix it I don't know okay let's taste it I'm actually curious as to what egg coffee tastes like I left you had not changed actually really good babe I thought it would taste weird for some reason I thought it would taste like just egg wait what I don't know it's actually really good all right it l coffee W that's weird this is super creamy down here's warm this is cold it's like a cold foam oh that's [Music] good so there was like a bell and I think the train is coming they're telling everyone to sit down and the police is telling everyone to get your ass off the train track [Music] actually so fast that's dud it's actually so long and it's so fast did you see that bullet train it was kind of scary guys I was kind of scared there for a [Music] second all right guys we're just walking around train Street this area is so energetic so many people as well look at this like little Alleyway where the train goes oh my gosh it's so cool it's so gorgeous check this out [Music] so this is got to be one of the most beautiful and energetic alley I've ever seen so I think this area in particular is where a lot of people go to watch the train but we were on the other side we were like way over there we just happened to be walking by and people were like oh the train comes in 10 minutes like do you want to come to my restaurant do you want to come to my Cafe and we're like okay guys look at this what a VI man what a [Music] VI all right guys so after the train Street we're currently here at their M we're here to buy sweaters yeah we're here to buy sweaters everyone's wearing a jacket look at us wearing a t-shirt and an is literally wearing a summer dress all right guys it is now 6:00 p.m. we got our sweater so we're pretty warm now we're going to be heading back to the old quarter we're going to be hitting a pretty popular spot it's called beer Street go check it out let's go [Music] so we just baited here at beer Street back to the old quarter the energy here is unmatched so many lights so much energy it is a Saturday evening lots of people here oh god I didn't even realize weekend know what a alley this look at this look at the colors it's so vibrant everything's so alive I love it [Music] [Music] an and I we definitely going to spend some time here this area makes you not want to go home I know it just makes you want to stay out all night Al there just go it's so hectic here I love it I was literally just saying crossing the roads here so different and we're from the Philippines and we're supposed to be used to this right but there like it's a lot crazier here watch out baby oh my God so we're stuck in traffic and we're not even in a car we're just standing here this is beer Street they should probably close this road down for cars we've been traveling for quite some time now and haven't encountered a street like this ever yeah the heck cars bikes people coming left right yeah restaurant bars everything you want it's [Music] here I found my souvenir [Music] all right we actually stumbled upon the weekend night market so we're going to go check it [Music] out guys lab boo is following us oh my gosh this Market is cool look at this [Music] for guys I think I found my souvenir very cute Netflix and B me [Music] boy look at this is this your dog so cute [Music] hi Patagonia you want North Face they got you why I shop at the mall I could got door face here for five [Music] bucks CH how much how much one all right so we got some skewers we got pork and chicken it's pretty pretty cheap it's like 1 for the chicken7 for the pork this big too look at that actually getting hungry I know say oh yeah oh my God sauce is really good you know what what I love about like Vietnamese food their meat especially the way they marinate it is so good it's so tasty you want try make chicken try the [Music] pork Oh this is like the pork they put on the verm s earlier M all right guys so day two here in Hanoi Vietnam before we start the day let's go get some coffee first let's [Music] go so we made it to this Cafe called tranquil and books it looks like a house wo it's so hidden [Music] so day two here in Vietnam and we're starting our day off here at tranquil books and coffee and it's this beautiful coffee shop here in Hanoi from the streets it actually looks like a random house but the more you walk inside it's like it's like very hidden so it's basically a Hidden Gem here in Hanoi oh thank you thank [Music] you all right so our coffee and food is here I got the creamy latte and and got the caramel macato we both got hot CU once again it's a chilly day it's only 18° C it's gloomy the sun is not out so this is going to keep us warm oh finally a good cup of coffee so I'm actually kind of hungry so I got waffles with strawberry and coconut ice cream did you get anything I just got coffee okay don't ask for some that's a small waffle though that's like yeah because it's just for me I'm just kidding you want some look at the latte art so cute look at mine it didn't even care about mine oh that's really good and I love the foam on top yeah their coffe is really good yeah not only are the cafes aesthetic but so far coffe is really good so after the cafe we're still a little bit hungry we're currently here at B me 25 it's a pretty popular restaurant it's located in the old quarter obviously bun is a popular food here so we're going to go give it a try all right so they have a few things but we're going to go with their signature which is barbecued pork and smoked sausage that's the traditional bunme everything looks good and it's quite affordable ranges from 35 to 45,000 Vietnamese doll around $2 to $3 so we're trying to find a SE seat they do have quite a bit of seating here they literally have like three different restaurants just for seats the main one is over there where we ordered and then there's like two other buildings just for seating still packed though all right we finally found a seat it's so pack B is like a baguette with meat and varieties of vegetables also guys if you're wondering how we get around we've just been taken the gr you can also rent the scooter but I'm not trying to die out here guys I was just telling Jen when we were walking into the cafe the roads here in Vietnam are more intense than the Philippines we're from the Philippines and we're like so used to the roads there but here we were shocked I think it's mostly in the old quarter since the roads are so tight thank you thank you does there anything come inside no you you got one that's mine I thought this was a fun me it's just bread so this is the one I got I'm not exactly sure what it's called I I pointed at the picture I'm like can I get this one but it looks good so they have like barbecue pork some sort of Patty egg and this thick consistency of a sauce ooh it smells sweet Savory ooh that consistency is so thick it's almost like syrup let me try it with the barbecue pork first oh yeah a little sweet but not too much it's just perfect balance the pork is just so tender M all right so an got her bun me yes this is the bun me okay I'm going to try my fun me pretty sure this is their most popular because this it's their signature look at [Music] that I barely got any of the meat though but the the bread already so good that's why I always let Jan take the first bite because it's all bread it's really good so look at this bun meat guys decent amount of meat in there for the price give a [Music] go M the baguette is so [Music] crispy okay so I'm going to try putting the soup inside the baguette is that how you do it put some egg in there look at that look at that doesn't that just look good M that so good the soup is very Savory a little sweet and since the baguette is a little Bland it's a good combination look at [Music] that so our next thought for today is Hanoi Sky which is an observation deck here in Hanoi initially we wanted to go for Sunset but it looks like we're not going to get a single sunset during our trip here in Vietnam since it is winter time apparently the observation deck is all the way on the 65th floor so let's go see the view from up top as always guys if you're wondering where we booked our tickets we booked it on cluk and if you want to do the same we do have discount code Janan cluk if you guys are planning a trip anywhere in Asia or anywhere in the world make sure to go on cluk and use our code Janan cluk and you will save some money thank you all right all the way up to it's just us babe yeah what he no one's here the 65th floor I guess it's just me and you holy C CRA nice oh wow babe the view is still so nice holy crap it's actually really nice up here look at this guys oh my goodness that's crazy so this observation deck is actually quite big very spacious one of the more spacious observation Decks that we've been to it's actually really nice up here I didn't really have like high expectations high expectations but this is pretty crazy see the lake the road so many houses so many buildings we we are high up I'm sure the video doesn't do it justice but when you're here in person even though it's a bit Misty outside and a bit cloudy it's still so beautiful from up here so they have a glass floor here go check it out God damn that's scary guys look at it oh my gosh that's scary look at the view oh my this is actually so sketch what am I doing whoa this is so cool [Music] all right guys so next stop is home km Lake apparently there's a lot of things going on near the lake so let's go check it out [Music] we're still beside the lake it's very cool cuz this road is closed off so there's people like renting bikes and scooters I don't know what those are called a really nice Vibe out here no cars finally [Music] [Music] so for dinner we decided to treat ourselves to a very well-known restaurant here in Hanoi called Tom V A lot of people love this restaurant because of its authentic and very traditional Vietnamese food and was the one that found this restaurant first of all it is beautiful in here and the food looks insanely good so looking at their menu they have quite a bit of set menu so this one right here is 730,000 Vietnamese Dong and you get quite a big and then over here another set menu which is 760,000 obviously you can order individual dishes as well this one looks amazing Vietnamese caramelized pork and egg speed we're getting this this looks so good dude their food looks amazing all right guys so we got her food smells so good so we got the brace beef with ginger and this one is the caramelized pork with egg and this is the sweeten sour pork rib soup this one you already know we got rice okay so let's give this a try look at this says Chopsticks the whole series no I don't think that that's how you're supposed to use it h yeah I don't know okay let's give a caramelized pork a try cuz this reminds me of adobo which is a pork dish in the Philippines so let's see if it tastes a like pork is super tender Oh So Soft yeah it does not taste like adobo at all it's more sweet Jan tried the adobo I'm going to try the SN up so this is the sweet and sour pork rib soup definitely reminds me of sagang and it also smells sour so basically sinang if you guys aren't familiar with what sagang is it's like pork soup in the Philippines it definitely reminds me of cagon just less sour more sweet if it were a little bit sour it would be like a 10 out of 10 let's try the brace beef with ginger and from what we read online a lot of people are ordering this and recommend this one it is so did you see that it just fell very very okay I like this one this is my favorite we somewhat killed it what do you think of it overall yeah I think it's really good I liked how the dishes reminded me of like homecooked meals but I think that's what this restaurant is known for traditional homecook meals overall I think it was a good experience but nothing mindblowing from the dishes that we ordered at we it was still really good I would still recommend coming [Music] here all right guys so after we ate we were just going to go home but I remember yesterday our server recommending a dessert place called Che 193 and that's why we're here they have a lot of different varieties of desserts like a lot yeah our server also said that this was her favorite place for desserts so obviously she's a local we trust her we're going to try thank you dude that looks so good all right so I got the yogurt with Violet sticky rice and got the coconut ice cream with mango so mine was $3,000 oh my gosh $30,000 it's sticky mine is just ice cream with mango I was craving some mango and obviously you can't go wrong with ice cream so mine is so good yogurt and some sticky rice look at that I like this so good what a perfect way to end the [Music] night all right guys it is now 900 p.m. and this is where we end the Vlog unfortunately but don't worry we'll have way more Vietnam Vlogs coming your way what a great first impression of Vietnam the past few days have been so much fun as always thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and follow us on social media for daily updates see you guys in the next

So, I'm just going to use the phone as it is and quickly show you what I bought. As you can see from the back, I think you can see what Oh my god, my hair is such a mess. I can see myself from the mirror. We don't care. We don't care. We don't judge. Um, we just send it in pocket. That's why I look so I don't know messy. Uh but I want to close off this vlog before I go shower and get in bed cuz I want to shower and get in bed. I don't want to shower and then come back and record. Okay. Um so I'm going to show you the first bag. Okay. This is actually cuz you can see it. I'm going to start with this one. This is the second bag that I bought. This is called the Louis Rafia bag. This has been my dream bag for years and years and years, but because of finances, I could never really afford to buy one. And also because Louv is not available in South Africa and these bags are handmade and I don't like the structures of the other bags. Even this one at the store. I asked them to check out all the white bags that they had. They took them out and luckily I found this one which has the perfect structure. Uh so happy that I didn't buy it online and I waited till I traveled to a store that actually has loving in South Africa it's currently approaching winter. I wish it was like I wish it was like November, December so I can use this bag. I'm sure when I get home, I'm going to put them away and then maybe check them out again in September once it's spring. But this bag is so stunning. Super super excited. Love it so much. So this bag cost 22,500 B. That is uh the money that they use in Thailand. So when you convert it to ren I'm telling you because when you look here you are going to see 22,500 B but in South African rand it is uh 12,800 rand. Um this is the cheaper version and this is the older version. I bought it because I've I've loved it for years and I could not stand not having it. So, I bought it in a different color because the latest one, the one I'm going to show you now, is the newer release. I think this has been around for like 3, four, 5 years. I'm not sure. But yeah, this is the receipt. So, I didn't pay 12,000 rand. I'm going to get 2,000 rand back. So, I basically paid like 10,000 I think 10,200 something like that. But I know that from the 12,800 rand, I'm getting 2,000 rand back as tax refund because when you are a tourist, you don't pay um the tax that side. And then this is for the second bag. I'm going to show you. So this is the recent bag that Louis came out with. It's so beautiful. I went on my Instagram and I asked them between this in brown. I didn't show them the white one. I said between this and this. Everyone voted for this, but I understand. I also love this. I bought it in the shade brown. They do have it in black. If I had money, I would have bought the black one as well because it's that beautiful. Uh but yeah, I had to choose because I couldn't afford like the both the black and brown and white. So, I went with this color and I left the black one. Maybe when life gets better, one day I'll afford to buy to buy a black one, but I would love a black one in a different design. Like, this is the white one. This is the white one, but it's in a different design. This is the brown one. It's in a different design. It's both loves, but different eras and different designs. Love, love that so much. Let me show you the price of this bag. It is a bit more expensive. um comes in this beautiful envelope. Then you take out the text, not the text, the receipt. The receipt looks like this. And then the total price is 35,000 um 100 H. Okay, here is the price. I don't know if you guys can see. So this is 35,100 B. So when we converted to South African R. Okay. 35, 100, but 3500. Oh, so this is the amount I paid. 20,000 uh 140 rand. And then my tax refund says um I'm going to get um I am getting 2,9 Oh, it's not even a lot. 2,296 B. I'm getting like 1,300 rand back. So, I think I bought this bag from like 19,000 18,900. Yeah. But yeah, I'm I'm claiming this money back. So, yeah, guys, I wanted to show you that. I hope you guys enjoyed our travel vlog. We haven't traveled in such a long time. It feels amazing being out. It was our first time in Bangkok. I highly recommend Bangkok. Like if you have a travel destination that you want to go to or if you want to come to Thailand, make enough time for Bangkok and also make enough time for Thailand. We're currently in Puket, Thailand, but it was our first time in Bangkok and I am obsessed. Uh Bangkok is cheaper than according to me, Bangkok is cheaper than uh Thailand, especially when it comes to accommodation. You guys will see in the next vlog. I this was the cheapest this this room it's a studio was the cheapest we can find. Everything else was like 1,500 2,500 and we were not pushing for luxury because we are going to be we were not pushing for luxury accommodation because we're going to be doing a lot of activities like in Bangkok we were never in our room like we only went there to sleep wake up and activity after activity. Same thing here, but uh we took this one because it's really the cheapest. But it's cute. I'm not honestly I'm not complaining. I want to spend my money this time around on shopping, not on accommodation. So yeah, as long as we have a neat, clean place to sleep at, I don't mind. So yeah. Okay. Bye.

I went for it and I'm so glad I did cause then I got to find out about Quince and finally finally finally I got my hands on some of the products I've been thirsting after like truly thirsting after

find some nice gold jewelry you can find cashmere but they're actually like 50 to 80% lower than similar brands and like we talked about in the decluttering video I'm really trying to only add capsule pieces to my wardrobe going forward that I know I will hold on to for a long time so Quince just aligned so perfectly with this season of my life so this is their boyfriend crew sweater and it's 100%

new here as guys can tell from the title it is our first travel Vlog of 2025 I'm so excited it's our first trip in 2025 and as you can tell we are going to AA Saudi Arabia y'all don't understand how excited I am for this trip I have been wanting to go to alula I'm please if I'm pronouncing it incorrectly my bad I don't know if it's alula alula I'm been seen people say it a bunch of different ways but anyways girl on dub bling they said a we're going going to Saudi Arabia and I have been wanting to go here ever since I seen this young lady and her two friends go to this Resort on Tik Tok I seen this like maybe a year and a half ago a year ago whenever she posted it I said bucket list bucket list and now obviously since we live in Dubai now it ain't nothing but a hop and a skip over so what better time than now so yes we are going to Saudi Arabia we actually leave in the morning but my flight is really early I'm talking looking like 6:00 in the morning early and I said I don't want to be rushing trying to do this intro so let's do it the night before we're only going for a weekend a quick little two-day trip just to go see it and hop back out because it is the winter time here in Saudi Arabia as well and baby day winter is wintering I'm talking Lowe's in the 40s which I mean honestly is probably better than going in the summer when it's like blazing blazing hot but yeah so we leave at 6:55 in the morning there is a direct flight from Dubai straight to Al so it is a 3-hour flight there super quick super chill super easy uh it's with fly DUI which is Emirates partner or like sister company y'all know me I used my points okay y'all always ask me about booking flights I booked my flight using all points I did not pay a single dollar or maybe I pay for taxes but girl you get what I'm saying I didn't I didn't pay no money for this flight but just to give you pricing on it it was pretty pricey for an economy ticket it was like $800 but I think that's because the winter season is like Prime season to go this is their busiest season because it's much more cooler than during like the spring and summer so I did use my Emirates points to book this flight you can just transfer them in from whichever credit card that you have transfer your points over to whichever partner Airlines your credit card allows and book it like that yeah being in Dubai is making this trip a lot easier for me and making it possible so you do need a visa to go to Saudi it was super duper easy it's an Eva you can do it online it takes 5 minutes to do and I literally got my Visa within probably 5 minutes you do have to pay for the Visa I believe it is 250 SAR and then it's good for a year after it's been given to you but once you enter into the country it's good for 90 days if I'm not mistaken double check on their website so we're leaving at 6:55 in the morning and we are staying at the our habitas I've actually stayed with this chain before in Morocco and I absolutely loved and adored it it's such a really cool and different type of experience so the resort in alula looks stunning so I don't want to Yap you guys' ear off too too much just giving some background info we're going to alula we're staying for 2 days flight price you do need a visa uh coming from the United States that is anywhere else I'm unsure also we are renting a car just want to put that out there and to rent a car you need to make sure you have your International dri's license depending on where you're coming from from my understanding you cannot just use your regular driver's license you need to have international driver's license so now that I think all the basics of like how to get there how to go there are kind of out of the way actually there are a few other tidbits just want to touch on because Saudi has shifted and changed a lot of their laws to welcome tourism and tourists into the country if you didn't know Saudi I believe in 2019 is when they began to allow tourists to visit the countes so that's pretty new and with that a lot of laws that they had have shifted for example unmarried couples before were not allowed to like stay in the same hotel room that was kind of a thing so that's no issue at our habas also women can drive so we can rent a car that's another big one which is really exciting also women can get hotel rooms in Saudi which is another big one so a lot of their laws have shifted and Chang geared towards um welcoming more tourism so with that we get to have this really cool experience so I'm really really really excited it's late I need to get some sleep I will see yall in the morning when we get on a plane girl see y'all tomorrow [Music] [Music] baby you prob maybe later [Music] tooold I see you [Music] you all right you guys we just landed in Saudi and we're in the car headed to the hotel like like I said we did rent a car I thought I was getting a Bronco I guess not girl this is a Toyota PR whatever that is but we landed it was about 50° F when we landed at 9:00 a.m. it didn't feel cold to me like at all it feels nice it's cool but I thought I was going to be really really cold but I'm not so we landed everyone's super kind super sweet it was very easy to get through customs and immigration they didn't ask for our visas and you can get a Visa upon arrival I think I mentioned that yesterday but they didn't ask for our Visas so I would still say get it cuz I don't know if maybe they have it in the systems on the back end I don't know but our Visa was never asked to be shown and then um went through customs super duper quick super duper easy going to the rental company super easy got the car I will say online I specifically emailed the rental company and asked them if you needed an international license to rent a car or could you use your American license or UAE license Etc and they said you need an international license girl we got to the counter you don't need an international license maybe still have one just in case but the man told me directly to my face I could use whatever license he was like American UAE just give me a give me a license so yeah but anyways we are headed to the hotel now we're headed to our habas it's about a 50-minute drive from the hotel so excited new country Saudi is beautiful so far the mountains look insane I'm going to stop talking and yeah my feeling on sa so I

cute is this so if you guys seen my Morocco Vlog when I went to mares I stayed with our habitas there very similar layout this one is definitely a little bit more Lux and Bouie that's for sure cuz that one was definitely more like a tent like we were camping like legit camping camping but anyhoo so as you can tell I put a little bit of makeup on when we were on the flight but I'm just going to jge it up a little bit before before we head out for the festivities we've got a jam okay it's not really jam-packed but I wanted to do like everything that I wanted to do here while I had time so I don't got no time to waste cuz I technically only have today and tomorrow you know today in about 30 minutes or so we're going to head to the alula adventure Hub and there you can do a bunch of different things they have ziplining they have atving there's like just a bunch of fun stuff you can do but what I am going to do is they have this giant swing so you get on it you're harnessed in and you swing through the canyon I've never ever done anything like that well let me not say anything like that I've never done that I've done skydiving y'all know I've done like zip lining and things like that but I've never done like a swing and it looked nuts so I was like I don't know what I'm seeking right now no I'm just kidding but yeah so we're going to go do that the price will be on the screen everything will be linked down below for you to book everything so like I said I'm just going to touch up my makeup a little bit cuz after that we're getting lunch at at Mariah Maria I don't know how to pronounce it but it is the giant it's a concert hall here and it is the largest mirrored building in the world we're going to have lunch over there there is a Michelin star Chef who has a restaurant there and so not only are we going to get to see the building and check it out but then we're also just going to have some lunch cuz hungry the heck cuz that little omelet on the plane yall know I don't like eggs so I didn't even eat that I'm not changing I'm going to wear the exact same thing that I wore on the plane just a black sweatsuit because number one it's cold when you're in the sun you start to get warm and toasty but the minute you're in the shade and God forbid the wind blows freezing I'm so not prepared so obviously if I'm going to be swinging in the canyon but I am bringing a change of clothes for when we go to lunch and the plans for later on today I'm going to finish getting ready and then we'll head out everything has been so great so far the staff has been really really good the room is gorgeous it's nice it's the perfect size the outdoor shower is so cute everything is just so nice I'm so excited to be here y'all don't understand I've been wanting to come here for so long so to like finally be here feels nuts not going to lie cuz I'm like I've been wanting to come for so long so it's really cool to to be here and to see it and yeah just excited and grateful and I should be a lot more tired than I am but I'm surprisingly wide [Music] awake I hate this place stuck in it's SP don't believe and very this was be when hell is like this got to be more got to be more sick of this head of Mind in trus and thoughts that paraly no is not there got to be more been here [Music] before life better or S got to break this patter floting away something we're saving it's over taking I always say so where do I end up at like where do I land I go down where somewhere no oh I thought it so you don't swing like this you swing like this m and then you guys put me down we'll see we'll maybe cut the rope the Rope looks really thin though I'm yeah it's actually really how often do you have to like come and change this stuff maybe after 10 years come

I hated this so much no that was horrible that was worse than skydiving my heart hurts so bad how do I get down oh my God y'all I'm sure you can tell by the screams of absolute Terror that that was horrible I that was worse than skydiving I would rather jump out of a plane every single day for the rest of my life then do that again it was very fun though I can't lie like I'm glad I did it but I'm not even going to sit here and cap or lie for y'all and act like oh my God like no like skydiving afterwards I was like oh my God that was so exhilarating like wow no that was horrible like it was really fun but truly horrible the hike up there was really cool though um like we had to do some climbing and it was a nice little I got some steps in for the day cuz youall know I've been on a plane all morning and yeah it was just a really cool experience for sure like swinging in the canyon I've never done like a swing like that before I don't know how to describe that feeling to you guys the anxiety that I felt I mean you watched the video but now we are headed to Mariah Maria Maria I don't know how to pronounce it but this is a really big event space concert hall and it is the largest mirrored building in the world so it's a giant mirrored building you're going to see and it's covered with over 10,000 square m of mirrors or glass that's a lot so we're actually going to go here to go check it out see the venue there's no event going on while we're here but they do have a restaurant and there is a Michin star Chef who cooks for the restaurant and so we're going to have lunch cuz after that swing I'm starving I need some food I'm hungry I need some water down the throat that scream someone needs to cast me in a horror movie like right now and just let me do that bit the whole time I should get paid for that scream that was that was paid worthy so now we're headed to the building it's about 15 minutes from the adventure Hub so everything's pretty Central like location wise and the Hub is about 20 minutes from the hotel having a car definitely a lifesaver I would 10 out of 10 say get a car when you come just makes it so much more enjoyable and you can just see the landscape and yeah it's really nice so we're going to head there get some food and check this building out I don't see how you can hate from outside of the club you can't even get [Music] in leg out yellow Che yellow yellow lambor yellow top missing yeah yeah that look like a to I what you get in 10 years in 2 days ladies love me I'm on my 2J if you get what I get no like I don't think you guys are understanding how insane this building is it is so big sorry if the camera is like super duper bright oh when you walk okay oh I know y'all just seen how I just turned like white I just look like Edward culling for like two whole seconds because the Sun reflecting off of the mirrors just hit me in my head and it's so hot right here like it gets like 20° hotter okay maybe not 20 I'm being dramatic as hell but y'all see this look at me now now look at me Miagi and suicide doors look at me now Look at me now I'm getting paper Look At Me Now oh look at me now yeah [Music] frh I get all right you guys so we are back at the hotel oh my God so lunch was cool the food was decent it was nice the building like I really cannot get over how big Mariah was again 10,000 square m of glass for the whole building like the way the sun was bouncing up off my forehead and off the building crazy but that was a really really cool experience something really cool to see so we're back at the hotel only going to be here for like the next 30 minutes because we are headed to this location called elephant rock so basically there is a big I know y'all see all the Rocks all the formations right so there's a really big one called elephant rock and it literally looks like an elephant it's huge like apparently this is gigantic and it's I mean all of these are gigantic but it's something people really seek to go to when they come here and they have these little like pods that you can sit in it looks so cool pool and we want to go for Sunset to see the sunset and just kind of chill and they've got like cafes like a couple cafes out there so you can get like tea and coffee and stuff um I heard their shisha too and yes if there is one I will be smoking one so I am going to change out of my filthy dirty disgusting airport sweatsuit that I've had on all day so it's time to change out of this I'm going to just be putting on this cute little like white linen set I'm going to freeze because I'm telling youall in the shade it's cold like I'm I'm cold right now but I want to take a really cute picture well I don't know about really C cute but I want to take a picture so basically I have this little white set that I got from miim Mod Dudi I have my little pink Coach bag that I've never worn and I have this cute little like heres scarf I think I might put it in my hair I don't know how I'm going to do that yet but I'm going to get myself situated I also need to add links to my YouTube video that's going up today so I'm about to kind of Dibble dabble for a quick minute so that's what's going on it's been a cool it's been a very eventful I feel like like first few hours here in Al alula alula but I absolutely love it here like can't lie having a blast I thought because I was only going to be here for 2 days and there's so much that I wanted to do in the 2 days that I was going to be a bit rushed I feel good like I feel really like good I yeah I thought I would be like really tired but I feel nice so I'm just chilling outside for now I'm going to like I said do my little bits of work that I need to do get changed and then we're going to head out cuz Sunset sets at 6:05 so we want to kind of get there around like 5:30ish so that we can actually watch the sunset and get settled take my pics the elephant rock is about 25 minute 30 minute drive from here so we definitely want to make sure that like we get there so everyone that we have come in contact with here in Saudi Arabia so kind from the minute we went through immigration not even went through from the minute we got to immigration everyone in the immigration Customs so nice so kind so welcoming everyone that we've encountered on our way from the car rental to the Rock to me Swinging I mean y'all probably heard all the conversation I was having with them it was so good everything has just been so nice to Mariah everyone has just been very very kind so Kos to Saudi okay with the with the hospitality cuz I think that's really big especially when you're traveling it's very nice to feel very welcomed wherever it is that you're visiting so going to change and get ready for our next sightseeing so by okay so when you come here to alant rock obviously you're coming to see the rock but there are areas for you to sit they have music that's being played right now and then there's some like cafes uh so you can get like drinks and tea and coffee and stuff so we're going to see what it's getting oh the sun it's a lot of people here I'm not going to lie so I'm probably not going to get in my little pod like I wanted because there's so many people but it's okay we're here for the [Music] Vibes I just to say all I'm asking for you I just want to sayl on put your onl online so we did end up finding a seat and the Elephant is right there so I'm waiting on the shisha and then we got like some coffees and stuff and we're just going to hang out and surprisingly it's not that cold look at what's arrived I'm going to smoke aish and every country I go to okay who would have thought I'd be smoking shisha in Saudi Arabia not me love that this is so cool the elephant is right there we got a really good seat so so honestly I don't really think people come and stay long so if you come you can snag a seat they have some that are reserved which they let me take some pictures in earlier which was really nice people are kind of just coming and going and obviously you can sit with people like in the pods there's some other people here with us as well it's really nice it's really nice the shisha is nice too I love it this is so nice like and it's a great change of scenery from Dubai it's obviously Sandy here too but the rock formations makes it just so cool to like see and just is so cool like so cool and the sunset's gorgeous just a nice Vibe and I got a latte a Spanish latte it's really good iced and that's what I'm saying it's actually not cold at all I thought it was going to be really cold but it feels good for right now and the coffee is really good I also would suggest not wearing white first of all my shoes my Chanel leather sneakers are and then it's a bit dirty out here so I wouldn't wear white just a tidbit when you come if you come asking for you I just to [Music] say all right y'all so we are back at the hotel elephant rock was so cool really nice Vibe like I wish there was something I mean there's tons of cafes and stuff you can chill out in to buy but the view of that was just so nice like you have to go there like very relaxing and just like really cool watching the sunset the cafe aspect was nice the Sha was was nice I know I kept telling you oh it's not that cold it's not that cold once the sun was all the way down oh it got cold it it got very very cold by about 7:00 7:15 not unbearable but it was pretty cold so we left we're back at the hotel chilling for a second habitas also has a sister property or I don't even know if you want to call it a sister property but they have another property here in Saudi Arabia called Caravan Caravans by habitas or habitas however you say it the same type of concept except you're staying in like an RV Caravan type of vibe and it's significantly cheaper than these as well but still like the same cool experience but on that property they do a movie night where they project a movie on the rocks and you sit outside and you watch the movie so obviously we're going to go do that that amenity or feature is available to anyone staying at the property and it's included in your reservations so when you book here they have a bunch of activities that they have on daily and all of them are free complimentary for you to participate in you don't have to book it you don't have to do anything you just simply have to show up so that starts at 9:00 so it's in about 40 minutes so I put my sweat clothes back on obviously cuz we're going to be outside and it's cold so hopefully they have some snacks cuz I'm kind of feeding for a little snacky snack and yeah so that's what we're going to go do the movie that we're watching is the most dangerous game I believe that's what it's called has Liam himsworth in it I just watched a trailer for it so that's what we're going to go see it should be really cool so I'm going to take my little DJI so you guys can see the setup cuz I think it's just going to be really cool to see a movie projected on a rock that's crazy so and the Stars oh my God y'all because there's like no light pollution out here the stars are insane like so bright so many like just clusters of stars all throughout the sky it is so gorgeous like it's just so nice I can't lie I've only been here for less than what 12 hours I love it here I love it here I love it here like I'm having a blast good morning everybody it is the next day just got up and got ready we're actually technically late because we're supposed to be going to hegra today that was supposed to be at 8:00 a.m. it's about 8:00 a.m. right now and we're about to go get breakfast I just was like you know no point in rushing and let me tell youall when I say it's cold it is 40° outside 40 I don't I I didn't I was not prepared so please know that if you come in the winter it's cold it is gold yeah we're getting ready to go to Hager let me show youall what I'm wearing I don't have my little I'm going to put a pasina on on top of this little sweater outfit that I'm wearing all right so this is what I'm wearing it's just a black sweater and black kind of like sweatpants type style I was going to wear like something else but it was too cold I couldn't so I put this on and then I've got my little like pashmin scarf that I wanted to wear I don't know how I'm going to wear it but you get me I'm just going to wrap up in this essentially and oh my God I didn't show yall my little Polaroid camera I got hold on I got the cutest polaroid so this is by Fuji film isn't it just so stinking cute and then also you can send pictures to this it's like a printer it's not just a camera it's a printer so you can like send your pictures to this from your phone and print them out in Polaroids even if they were never like polaroid pictures do you get what I'm saying you know like when you be on vacation and stuff and you be wanting to take polar pictures and let's say you forget oh baby you could just print it straight through I love this it's so cute but anyway so yeah and then I just have on these gold earrings and then I actually am wearing my braids down which is crazy cuz never do that I told you I don't wear my braids down I don't usually like the way it looks but they look okay today it's kind of cute so let's go see what the breakfast is talking about it is included in the room rate so when you stay here breakfast is included for two people per room so hopefully it's good dreams of I don't want just and I don't want feel your break because I got to be strong now I got to show you how I love you like never I'll give you you didn't even you don't [Music] [Music] [Applause] tell all right y so we're about to head out to go to hagra and this is our mode of transportation so the place comes with ebikes so if you don't want to wait for like the golf carts you just hop on ebike and go they just hop on your bike oh it's so [Music] fast I want to try to record myself riding the bike with you guys I'm more of a passenger seat kind of girl what can I say it's a bit much all right you guys so we finished breakfast made it to the front got in the car and now we are headed to hegra so hegra is actually one of Saudi Arabia's most like iconic tourist destinations or places that you should go it is their first UNESCO heritage site 2008 is when it was recognized so that's kind of like a big deal it's basically where the natine correct my pronunciation civilization was and it was like a really prominent City and there's tons of like tombs and carvings and and just it's supposed to be a really cool site to go see very historical so that's where we're headed should be a good time well while we were on our way to hegra we actually are like pulling over to just kind of sit for a few minutes because on the road to get to hegra there's like a cop car pulled like in the middle of the street and we've actually seen a lot of police doing this we'll just be driving and then they're just like stopped in the middle of the road we don't know why or what's going on but he just said it'll be back open to like drive through in about 30 minutes so we're just going to chill and sit here because it's 20 minutes to get back to the hotel so then by that point it would be time to come back do you get what I'm saying so we're just pulled over literally I don't know if you can see out the window we're just going to chill for a minute until they open the road back up and then we will go to hagra I also want to mention cuz I know I told you guys that everyone is super friendly so far that we've encountered including the police so even in this moment like they're stopping everybody from driving and we just kind of were like hey like we're trying to go to hagra like is everything you know can we go and he was just like oh 30 minutes It'll open back up super nice about it smiling like no bad interactions or like anything weird or anything at all so no need to feel like scared or you know what I mean just want to put that out there cuz y'all know we was in Madagascar we was hustled okay well we weren't hustled but they tried to bribe us for money so that's not what's happening we're here at the venue now this is where you come and check in once they scaned your tickets you get an audio like guide so every time you hop off at a stop you press this to read it and it tells you about where you're going so this is the bus there's one every 5 minutes at every stop so let's hop on to go to our first stop so these are the four sites that we'll be stopping at and then this audio guide will tell us about everywhere we stop at so this is included in your ticket you got to know you got to know you got to know you got know you got know you got know you got know you got you got you got you got know you got know you got know you got know you gotone you got Al you got you got you come know you come you come know you come you you you all right you guys so we finished our hag tour it was so cool to see so much history and just it's a really cool place like you really can't grasp the size of the stuff that we're looking at so we finished and then when you get back they have like gelato so I got some they have chocolate and then yogurt so you can get plain yogurt flavor or yogurt with berries I got yogurt with berries and it literally tastes like frozen Greek yogurt with berries it's really nice like really really good so just chilling now and you know what's funny it was so cold today remember I told you guys it was freezing right well when you're in the sun it's hot like the UV index is like a seven which is pretty high you get hot like for sure so definitely not cold anymore I wore this sweatered outfit for no reason cuz I was hot baby but it was a really really good time I really enjoyed it here I'm a bit sleepy now but we're going to go back and explore the hotel now [Music] [Music] so now that we're back at the hotel we're going to enjoy some of the art installations some of the amenities and the first one are the swings by the way when you come baby wear some some real sneakers not these zombas I got on [Music] you know that I miss you I want to get with you tonight but I cannot baby is girl you know I miss [Music] just kiss me through theone kiss me through the [Music] baby I know that you

deeper I miss you I miss you I really want to kiss you but I can't one take me you know that I miss you I want to get with you tonight but I canot baby girl and that's the issue okay so the swings were so fun being able to like swing like in the canyon Mountain whatever so now I'm going to go on a hunt to try to find the trampolines so basically on property they have all these different art installations and some of them are like interactive so like the swings that's an art installation it's called um swing with with me or something like that and then the trampolines are called Now You See Me Now you don't and there are a bunch of trampolines in the middle of the ground like in the middle of the mountains and you can like jump on them so I'm like okay I need to go find those so I think they're around this way and I kind of feel like they have to be because there's tons of footprints over here which means people definitely have been walking over here so I think they're like literally just around this mountain look it's a little bright sorry guys okay well you get what I'm saying we're like walking around that way and I think they're like back around this mountain [Music] [Applause] [Music] wao hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey [Music] heyy [Music] hey so we're back from the little swing and the trampolines that was so fun I felt like a kid I don't I literally can't remember the last time I was on a swing or the last time I was on a trampoline like that was just so cool it was very fun and surprisingly it wasn't busy at all like there was no one on the trampolines no one on the swings the hotel is packed they told us they were completely sold out and we really haven't like been in like we haven't seen people really outside of the lobby like at all so it's very private like if you come I definitely would say like the Privacy like you don't really run into people like at all so that's really nice now I have this gorgeous dress you guys that I want to take a picture in I'm not wearing it anywhere I literally just want to take a picture in corny but it just is what it is so I'm going to show it to you guys it's from this brand called U offer I don't know how to pronounce it but it'll be linked down below stunning dress let me show it to you hold on when I show youall this dress it's not going to look like much like at all you're just going to be like okay it's just going to look like a big rag but when it's on the body it looks so good so this is the that's the brand and then this is the dress I got it in a size small it's going to be really difficult for you to see without it being on I know it just looks like I said it's just going to look like a giant sheet when you see this on so gorgeous so fitting for the location in my opinion so I'm like I need to put this on and go take a beautiful photo like out in the Rocks so that's what I'm going to do I'm put my makeup on and then I will show you all the Vibes in a second all right y'all I'm all Glam up as you can see face is be it looks so cute and I put my braids all the way up in a ponytail cuz when you see the dress do we see the dress do we see the vision in the rocks can you imagine like what so no shoes or bag cuz I'm not actually wearing the dress this is literally just for content and there's no point in shoes cuz I'm going to be in the sand and yeah so the dress I already told you guys where it was from it'll be linked down below so gorgeous I'm going to wear this eventually somewhere but I'm going to take a picture in it today these earrings are from svon NYC and then the necklace is from Zara this bengle is from svon I believe and this bangle is from misho design so just some extraness for Vibes I might put some more rings on this is what we're looking like I love the hair and the ponytail I think it's so pretty and I think in the Rocks the it's not really about me it's more about the dress and the Rocks you feel me so let's go through these [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] things all right you guys so we took our pictures I took 1,300 photos I know I know that sounds really crazy cuz that is really crazy and out of the, 1300 guess how many I liked like possibly in the running to be posted 41 41 pictures yeah it's you know it's just it's a thing okay anywh who so pictures are done we did everything that I wanted to do here there is a sound bath like medic meditation class at 900 p.m. tonight that if I finish dinner in time I would really like to go to but I don't know if we're going to finish dinner in time cuz it's 7:15 now and we're getting ready to go to dinner so yeah I'm about to get dressed I'm not going to get dressed fancy we're actually just going to be going to dinner here on property because last night we didn't have dinner like we didn't eat here we were going to go to downtown or like Oldtown alula but honestly so tired y'all yesterday I think because we were just so pumped and going going going I was like cool today I'm tired like I want to lay down I'm tired so we're probably just going to eat here on property um when I was up there where I took my photos is like by the restaurant it smelled so good too so I was like you know this ain't going to be too bad so we're going to have a good dinner tonight I'm very hungry going to change but this trip has been so fun so cool like I'm so glad I came like it's been on my bucket list for like I told you literally ever since I seen shorty video I said yeah cuz one thing I I love a good hotel y'all know me I love a fun nice hotel okay and this is a really cool conceptual type of like Hotel Vibe and I've stayed with hobby toss before in Morocco so I was like okay I'm familiar with y'all I know how y'all get down yeah I really had a great trip I definitely would say if you are able like come to Saudi come to alula specifically this is the only place I've been to I absolutely have had the best time random note I wish that my hair was not so fine because I I love the way that braids look on me but baby the way that I'm about to have first of all I don't even got damn much Edge in the first place okay yes Edge not EDG is Edge I

was great and then went back to the room I was so tired that we just went straight to sleep and now it's very early it's 7:30 in the morning we're headed to the airport the airport is about an hour drive allegedly from the the hotel so we've got quite a bit of a drive and we've got to turn the car in check my bag um and this is the only flight to Dubai today so I'm going to imagine it's going to be pretty busy so but the trip was absolutely amazing enjoyed it top to bottom I have no complaints and alula has really streamlined like your tourist experience here because if you go to the website

bEVp82kxY25-pAuFCQ24yqR1ImI,5 Days in Tokyo 🇯🇵  Japan Travel Vlog,Welcome to the first part of our honeymoon in Japan! We spent the first part of our trip in Tokyo and it has officially become one of ...,Daniel and Alicia Travel,2024-10-24T11:57:35Z,"{'default': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ee6o3eBMjxA/default.jpg', 'width': 120, 'height': 90}, 'medium': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ee6o3eBMjxA/mqdefault.jpg', 'width': 320, 'height': 180}, 'high': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ee6o3eBMjxA/hqdefault.jpg', 'width': 480, 'height': 360}}",UC32e2ANOkl65kgS7hxc_M5Q,Ee6o3eBMjxA,1270,266334,en,Ee6o3eBMjxA,"Check out how we spent five days in Tokyo. We feasted on sushi and Wagyu omakase, ventured to Kamakura for the day, enjoyed the views at Shibuya Sky, went to restaurants, coffee shops, did some shopping and more. Our first day in Tokyo started off with some amazing coffee at Onibus in Meguro City. It was definitely our favorite. Onibus is the Portuguese word for public bus. The creators liked the concept of how the bus connects people and how their coffee could do the same. We were there for the sakura, but a cold snap delayed the bloom. As we were walking around, we smelled something amazing and that turned out to be Truffle. With an aroma like that, we had to try a couple pastries. This is Sushi Punch. We went at lunch because it's more cost effective and it was our first omakase ever. Omakase is a meal consisting of dishes selected by the chef. It was easily one of the best meals we had in Japan, and some of the best sushi I've had in my life. Chef Yuichiro Sasaki made everyone feel welcome, and he's absolutely jacked. Check out the guns! If you're in Ginza and someone asks you to meet them at Uniqlo, make sure you ask them which one. There's two, and both of them are massive, like this. Also, if you're a tourist, it's tax free. The Loft has six floors of curated Japanese goods across categories like stationery, home decor, beauty and lifestyle products. The sheer variety ensures that you'll find something you like. We stopped by a Depachika. That's a department store, DEPA, and basement in Japanese, Chika. It's mostly food and souvenirs. Coffee number three was at Fuglen. We wanted something with a bit more of a kick, so we ordered Irish coffees while we waited out the rain. Tsukemen translates to dipping noodles. And they're not your regular ramen noodles. They're thicker and chewier, which is great for absorbing broth. And make sure to slurp. It shows the chef you like the food. This is the world famous Shibuya Crossing, and it can have up to 3,000 people crossing at a time. We're back at Fuglen to find Alicia's lost glove and to see how their coffee is when it's not Irish. TeamLab Borderless is a museum where the art moves in and out of rooms, interacts with you and other art pieces. For example, in this room these graphics would be sunflowers the next time we came through. The whole point is to wander, discover, and interact with this borderless, immersive art piece. Here's Alicia petting a flower lion and you can see where she made contact, the flowers are left behind. One of my favorite rooms was the lily pad room because in the beginning, the lilies were around waist high and as you move through the room, they got taller until they were a canopy above your head. This is one of the rooms where you could control the art with an app on your phone. But despite what it looks like, we never ended up figuring it out. But it was still a very cool room. Here we are at my favorite room, because it reminds me of that part in the movie Inside Out, where they made a core memory, and with this being our honeymoon and first time in Japan, this was definitely a core memory for us. If you're in town, I recommend stopping by and making a memory of your own. I'd heard about Latte Art Mania and their black latte from a colleague at work. Once I saw their IG, I had to go. Was it worth it? Did it taste like charcoal? Do they have latte art classes? Yes. No and yes. But you'll never truly know until you stop by for some drinkable art yourself. Of course, happy pancakes have a sunny disposition, but they're also fluffy and more eggy than cakey, and take about 20 minutes to bake. The butter is insanely good. Give it a shot. It's a different kind of pancake. Onitsuka Tiger is a heritage brand that mixes fashion and sportswear. I'm a fan of the look and the history. After the war in 1949, Onitsuka wanted to help the youth of Japan build a better future. He did that through shoes and sports. It was so influential. It inspired the birth of Nike. Blue Ribbon, the predecessor of Nike was set up to bring Onitsuka Tiger to the US. If you love the cross-section between fashion and sport, you'll love Onitsuka. El Fujiyama has some of the best mezcal cocktails I've had in my life, and we've been to Oaxaca. My love for Mezcal is exactly why Alicia and I had to come to this place. And if you like, love, or are slightly interested in mezcal, you should stop by for a drink or two. The establishment is intimate and sits around eight people, so make reservations. Afuri Ramen is known for its yuzu. That's a citrus fruit, so if it's your first time, try their signature bowl, the Yuzu Shio Ramen. Alicia set off for a facial. So I met up with a colleague that lives in Japan. Hiroshi walked me through local portions of Tokyo, which I never would have went to on my own. We ended up at a place he used to eat regularly for a tasty lunch. Alicia went to Koh Gen Do in Minato City for a 90 minute facial and makeup application. At the time, it was ¥20,000 and we put the link in the description. This standing sushi bar was great. The ambiance was relaxed and cozy. The beer and sushi were a perfect combo for a small meal before a Wagyu omakase later on that night. This precinct is home of Meiji Jingu Shrine. The forested area covers about 70 hectares of land, or about 173 acres of land. These sake barrels are displayed as decoration. They're placed at the shrine entrance as an offering to a multitude of gods and souls of the deceased. The barrels are donated by Japanese saké brewers to be used for ceremonies and festivals. Meiji Jingu is a Shinto shrine. Shinto is Japan's oldest religion and originated there in 660 BC. It's practiced in public shrines devoted to worshiping a multitude of kami, which are gods. These are Ema. You write down your wishes or give thanks and hang them around the camphor tree. Miyabi Asaka is known for their Wagyu omakase. We got the Miyabi Special course, which is ten types of A5 black Wagyu and nine other dishes. It was ¥12,000 at the time, which is about $81.86 USD. And that's for two people. We also got the special organs, which were intestines. I'll probably pass on them the next time, but I'm happy to have given them a shot. The Wagyu was incredible. The beef was as soft as butter, literally melted in your mouth. After you get a demo on how to cook, you get to do it yourself. Alicia is doing a phenomenal job, and for those of you wondering if nine pieces is enough, I would say yes. The cuts of meat have considerable marbling, which makes them more filling than you'd assume. But beware, once you have wagyu like this, everything else pales in comparison. We woke up a little late for our day trip to Kamakura, so we picked a coffee shop near a hotel in Shibuya. That coffee shop ended up being Beans. It was a really nice atmosphere, the staff was polite, and the building had beautiful lighting. When Alicia was waiting for her coffee to cool she noticed something really awesome It was dogs. They have dogs. Two pups just cruising around saying hello to customers, which I’m a big fan of, and it was my favorite part about Beans. Kamakura is a seaside city known for it’s temples, shrines, shopping, and food. For 950 Yen you can zip there on a train from Shibuya in a little over an hour. But we took the Odakyu Line from Shinjuku. It’s much longer, but known for it’s vintage trains and scenery when the weather allows. One of the main attractions is the Great Buddha. However, due to weather and bad timing, we never made it. Midday in Japan is difficult for food. There are a lot of places that close to prepare for dinner. But luckily Onari Yokocho was open. The place was cozy with 90s R&B and hip hop, attentive service and good saké. Alicia got vegetable ramen, which was really light and delicious, and I got a sashimi bowl which was satisfying, but didn’t weigh me down. If you stop by check out the their Sake Menu. We wanted a dessert after lunch and the doughnut display at the Chocolate Bank caught our eye. We ordered a strawberry filled doughnut, mini babka, and they were so light we had no trouble eating both. Full disclosure, I was thinking we might need to take some home because of the size and that’s when I learned that taking home leftovers isn’t really something they do in Japan. Alicia heard about Bar Trench and it was a nice walk from the Hyatt House in Shibuya, which I highly recommend. So we took an evening stroll to see it. The bar snacks were so good  they were borderline addictive. Alicia and I had a couple drinks and we were fans of everything. My drink had a little warning label about it being strong and the waiter made sure I knew what I was ordering. But it didn’t taste strong, it just tasted delicious. So I ordered two. Everything about Bar Trench was amazing. We can’t recommend it enough. Pizza Marumo was another place we'd heard good things about, but more specifically about their Umami pizza. It has dried shiitake mushroom cream sauce, mackerel, bonito flakes, and more. As we saw the pizzas going out we had a serious talk about ordering three of them. But we stuck with the Umami Pizza and  it was unreal. Go and you’ll thank us later. Paddlers Coffee is pretty popular and I think it should be. They have a nice patio and the entire design of the place is warm and homey. It feels like a place that you'd regularly meet up with friends. They also have events like pop up stores and art exhibits. Their coffee is great. They have beans from all over the world, Honduras, Ethiopia, Indonesia. They even have Stumptown from Portland. And having some nice warm coffee on a chilly day underneath a cherry blossom tree  is a really good way to start the day. Even if the tree hadn't blossomed yet. Shibuya Sky is 229m, or about 731ft tall. If you have trouble picturing that, it's about two and a half football fields tall, and at the top is an open air observation deck. Shibuya Sky is in Shibuya Scramble, which is pretty close to the world famous Shibuya Crossing. Tickets are ¥2,500 each and you can reserve your time in advance. You can see how big Yoyogi Park is, and it's right next to a Meiji Jingu shrine, which we went to on our third day in Tokyo. This is that open air observation deck I was telling you about. The views are great. The whole experience took around an hour, so if you're in Shibuya, throw it in the mix. It's cost effective. It's by a bunch of other attractions, doesn't take that long, and it's cool. Welcome to Bonus Track. It's a group of shops around a courtyard, and it's really close to Shimokitazawa. These boutiques are unique, and there are a couple of fun combos. There's a record store that serves Taiwanese food, a bookshop with craft beer. And if we went again, we check out their monthly schedule because they have events. This is actually a bookstore, but they have really good food and drinks. The Whiskey Highball ended up being our drink of choice for this vacation, and now we wish they served it more here in America. Their curry was phenomenal and their ingredients were really high quality. Look at how orange the yolk is. If you love My Neighbor Totoro and cream puffs, you have to come here because they actually serve delicious Totoro cream puffs. A cool, fun fact about this bakery is that it's officially recognized by Studio Ghibli. These cute little cream puffs are photogenic and delicious. Yoyo is well known for its Basque cheesecake? Why Basque cheesecake? It's much lighter, almost airy, and has a soufflé like mouthfeel. Alicia and I love Mexico. Baja, Mexico City, Oaxaca are all great places to make memories, so we were attracted to this little shop. Pad has a wide range of gifts and souvenirs for anyone who wants a piece of Mexico from Tokyo. From Fuzkue to here, Bar Zikkai, you can tell reading holds a bit higher of a station than it does in the US. And yes, people read here. It's not just for decoration. Alicia got the First Love inspired by a poem with the same name. It was made with mulberry wine and champagne, which gave it a slightly sweet, fragrant and gentle flavor. I got March's great Writer's Cocktail, which was inspired by the story Under the Cherry Blossom Forest in Full Bloom. This is The Night on the Galactic Railroad. The drink comes in two parts, the deep purplish blue liquid in a bigger cup, and a smaller vial of pink liquid. When you pour the pink drink into the large cup, you can see the color change and after a good stir you can see the gold leaves swirling around. It ends up being a little galaxy in a glass. When this gentleman found out we were on our honeymoon, he gifted us with a bag of jasmine tea. It was really thoughtful and meant a lot to Alicia and I. I can't remember the name of this delightful drink, but I can tell you it was amazing. Like everything else in Japan. This is New Torigin which is actually the original Torigin. There's two. We learned about this spot from watching Ralph and Sam's vlog. We really enjoy their content on YouTube. The oyster rice had a really fun presentation and as you can see, it was served piping hot and the oysters are not small. My favorite was easily the yakitori. Hot. Flavorful. Delicious. If you come here, I'd grab a bunch of these guys. Next station is Kyoto.",1,The video is a travel vlog detailing a honeymoon trip to Tokyo

On day one, we lost our luggages. So, to eat away our sorrows, we got these vegan straw waffles from Queen's True Waffles. If I'm not wrong, this is the only spot that sells the vegan version. We got the one coated in chocolate and nuts. And I've got to say that this truly tasted like heaven. Warm and crispy waffles filled with a gooey caramel filling. I couldn't even tell it was vegan. Then for lunch, we made our way to Ramen Impossible where we got the shrimp katsu. Super crispy and delish. For the ramen, we got the spicy amazement and the spicy miso. Tell me you're brown without telling me you're brown. The first ramen had a thick and creamy sesame broth, which I loved, whereas the miso ramen was a little more lighter on the palette, but still as flavorful. Everything was just packed with so much umami. We were then invited to Marggo's new location opening where we had some drinks. We also had like cute little pastries for tasting, and we tried the spinach and the key lime one that were perfectly flaky. We also managed to meet the founders, Marggo and Aiden. They were so sweet. Then to beat the heat, we had to get some gelato, we stumbled upon this cafe where I got this pistachio gelato. So nutty, dense, and I could barely tell it was dairyfree.

Um it is unconfirmed. It's only what's been briefed out to some of the press and undoubtedly it will be subject to quite a lot of pressures on all sides. But as far as we can tell, this is what's being said, that within the whole battlefield, there'll be a freezing more or less where the front lines now are. So the famous front line that we've got used to this big semicircle will more or less freeze. Um, and that means that the Russians would have to give up the ambition to to have the whole of the four areas that they the four areas that they took, Luhans, Donetsk, Zaparisia, and Kersson. Uh, in September 2022, they annexed them all. They just declared that they were all Russian, even though they only then had twothirds of them. And they still don't have more than about four fifths of them. And indeed, in Hersan, they took the whole of Kerson itself originally and then were kicked out of there in the autumn of 2022. So the Russians would have to accept that they're not going to get under these proposals everything that they claimed. Um the Ukrainians would have to accept that the whole of Crimea that was taken in 2014 in the first in Russian invasion um would be dejour given to UK uh to Russia that the Russians would be recognized as having control of Crimea. Now that's something that the Americans may say will give you formal control of Crimea. I'm not sure the Europeans and many other states in the world will go along with that because there's a very big principle involved. But it would mean that the Ukrainians would have to accept that they have permanently lost Crimea. The Russians would have to withdraw a little bit from a couple of areas around the Deniper River. The Neper River is critical to Ukraine. You've only got to look at where it flows from north to south to understand that. And the Russians would have to withdraw under these proposals a little bit from the river where they were driven out from Hersan across the river. They'd have to withdraw a bit further away from the river in a couple of places in order to give the Ukrainians complete access to the river, which of course is very important to their economic well-being getting out to the western part of the Black Sea. And then there's the question of the Zaparisia nuclear power plant. Very important. The Russians have taken a lot of the Zaparisia area and they occupy the power plant, but they don't occupy the city of Zaparisia. Very important industrial city. Quit 3/4 of a million people before the war. And that's really important. whatever happens to the Zaparisia plant, the Russians can't continue to control it in any stable ceasefire. So, one proposal is that the Americans might control it. We'll see where that goes. So, that's an idea of the um the territorial basis of these proposals, but along with that also goes the idea that Ukraine will give up forever the idea of joining NATO. And that again is something that is plausible, but won't be easy to accept. And what isn't clear is whether there is a a willingness for other states to be involved in a peace support or a peace enforcement uh mission. What's being briefed out is that the Americans are interested in having the Europeans involved in some way along with non European or non-NATO states to look after the whole of this thousand kilometer boundary between the Russians where the Russians are fighting and where the Ukrainians are fighting. A thousand kilometer long front line that's a pretty big peace line to police. somebody might have to police it. And the Russians have said that they won't accept any NATO troops anywhere in Ukrainian territory. But of course, Ukraine will remain a sovereign state, so they can have whoever they want to invite in if they're prepared to come. Lots still to discuss. The fact is that this is a an outline of a peace plan which is being pushed very hard by the United States. We assume by the 30th of this month, which is 100 days since Donald Trump took office, and he has a very big stake in showing that he's brought some sort of ceasefire to Ukraine in the first 100 days. But most ceasefire plans take a lot longer than this to negotiate. And I think we're a long, long way yet from a plan that looks genuinely plausible.",2,"The video transcript does not contain any explicit claims that lack credible evidence or promote unfounded theories. It primarily discusses a tentative and unconfirmed peace plan proposal related to the Ukraine war, providing a detailed analysis of the potential terms and challenges involved. While the transcript mentions the involvement of the United States and other states, it doesn't suggest secrecy, cover-ups, or manipulation by powerful entities in a way that would typically align with conspiracy theories. The content is speculative but within the context of political and diplomatic processes, without resorting to fear-mongering or distrust of authoritative sources. Therefore, it is unlikely that the video supports conspiracy theories or misinformation."

However, it doesn't clearly promote conspiracy theories or specific unfounded claims about secret cover-ups or manipulation by powerful entities.

Without more context or specific claims, it's difficult to assess this as promoting mis/disinformation definitively."

And I think that's brown sugar. So, I added some brown sugar to it to give it a little bit of sweetness. So, I cooked the cornbread muffins for the amount of time it told me to, and then I ate one, and I realized, hey, this is still raw on the inside, so I had to cook them long.

It can be a big difference such as comparing light and heavy attacks to a small difference such as the first and second attack of a same attack chain. The formula goes motion value number with 100 being a multiplier of one times weapon AR equals to resulting damage. Some weapons have higher motion values on some attacks than the rest of the weapons in their class, like the blood hounds fang with its jump attacks or the beastclaw great hammer with its charged heavy attacks.

Because he pulls off things that are straight up impossible in survival mode. Like he magically summons two elytra out of nowhere. But elytra are super rare endgame items and you got to defeat the Ender Dragon just to find one. Then he casually takes Garrett and Henry to a secret stash loaded with TNT, firework rockets, boots of swiftness, full diamond armor, swords, and more. That much rare loot in one place definitely gives off creative mode vibes where you can grab anything instantly. And get this, Steve builds a whole house using pink sheep wool, but pink sheep are super rare in the game. And the automated lava chicken farm also requires redstone dispensers and precise engineering, which can be complex in survival mode. Throughout the movie, we never actually see Steve take damage or mine even once, which suggests either he's in creative mode or doing some serious offscreen mining. And that Herobrine reference, yeah, that just made things even more suspicious. So, what do you think? Was Steve actually in creative mode or just a Minecraft god?",1,The video transcript is discussing in-game mechanics of Minecraft and whether a character was in a specific game mode (Creative Mode) rather than Survival Mode.

but you know I use a Mac I use an iPad so an iPhone just makes sense for me and this iPhone 16 Pro Max has been absolutely amazing the camera has been absolutely stunning I've taken this with me on a few holidays and a few business trips and things like that and so happy with some of these photos that I've taken and the video of course is second to n to and the other things are great as well the screen is nice and big you know edit a lot of Instagram reels and I do all that on a phone so having a nice big screen for that is just ideal the screen is also the perfect way to show off this wonderful wallpaper I'll link that below if you want to check it out too and I also have to say that I have not used a camera control on the 16 Pro Max like at all sometimes I'll use it to open the camera if I remember it's even there but the muscle memory is just so built into to me to press the little camera button on the screen that I just use it that way so for me it's the camera screen and battery life and the Apple ecosystem which kind of just keeps me tied in here which is why it would be very difficult to switch but I have thought about it a little bit recently and if you want to see some videos on some other devices like these nothing phones then these have been the only other ones I've actually been kind of interested to check out so if that's something you want to see please let me know in the comments below because I think they're quite cool devices moving on from there is my latest addition to my watch collection which is slowly consuming my wallet and my entire life this is a noos club but it's a hinki special edition and it came in four different colors and each was limited to 75 pieces and it's got this wonderful open case back design you can see all the movement and all that sort of things inside of it but it's also got the date complication and this really wonderful blue subc style which I think just looks fantastic it really pops off the orange color away and it also kind of matches my jacket quite nicely which is obviously a big plus as well however I am kind of in the market now for my first ever you know luxury piece which is a ridiculous thing to even talk about but I'll show you the contenders actually made like a full free form thing about this but I'm thinking about grabbing either a Cartier Santos in medium a speedy a Rolex Explorer 36 a Tuda black Bay 58 and I've also kind of been tempted by some Grand Seiko stuff as well especially the shun bun but if you have any ideas of other ones I should look at let me know in the comments below because this is the sort of thing which is slowly taking over my life and algorithm at the moment if you are wondering why I don't wear a smartwatch or something like that first up I'm a creat I get like hundreds of notifications a day which I just don't want on my wrist I know you can switch that off but for me for someone whose life is so orientated around Tech it's actually really nice to have something on your wrist which is like a sign of the old Tech this is a piece of technology technically from over a hundred years ago and the fact that it's you know purely mechanical and doesn't need a battery or anything like that it's just this kind of wonderful thing I think to have attached to you rather than just another screen when it comes to wallets I've got something new as well and this is my new one it's from Ridge who make a bunch of wallets I think they're in cahoots of MKBHD at the moment but I'm a big fan of card only holders especially here in the UK we don't use cash much and in the past I've used this one from hersel which I quite liked and then last year I moved on to this car heart one which I was a big fan of as well but the problem is with these fabric ones as much as I love them they tend to get loose over time this used to hold my cards really securely but these Pockets have just been kind of slowly loosening up so Ridge actually reached out and said if I wanted to check these out and this video isn't sponsored by any means they just said have a look and see what you think and it's actually been pretty good I've actually really enjoyed using it you can hold up to 12 cards in here which is quite nice and it's also got a money clip on the back if you do need any cash or anything like that but it's just a nice neat thing and it comes in a bunch of nice colorways as well the only piece of feedback I will give though is I wish this had some sort of key ring holder on it because I like having an air tag attached to my wallet so I can track it wherever I lose it but there's nowhere for this to kind of really hook on and if there's like a tiny piece of metal that went across the top here where I could just hang something like this that would be ideal so I might look into getting one of those find my kind of cards instead of using the air tag but yeah using it as nice and easy just push the cards in and then when you need them you got this little fun grip here and you can just push out the cards that you want to get at it's a nice little wallet and I'm more confident with something like this which is completely made of metal which hopefully won't loosen over time like those other two have when it comes to my keys I've been using an orbit key key organizer for a really long time now and I've been really happy of that but Ridge actually also sent out their key holder here for me to take a look at and I've got to admit I don't like this one as much it's a bit more tricky to use and that's because this is made out of metal which makes it really rigid and it just makes it a little bit more tricky to kind of push your keys out so I would likely go back to my Orbit key on there however this design of key holder is something I really like you can push your keys out and you can also put little Tools in there as well like I've got a little flathead screwdriver and a bottle opener and a ruler and kind of a file all based in one thing it's just really useful to have yeah they match nicely together but I think I will go back to the orbit key organizer okay next up let's talk about gaming on the move and lately I have been using the Sony PSP oh that sound is just memories right there this is part of an ongoing experiment for me to kind of keep me off my phone and off social media is just to carry around an old retro gaming device where I can kind of sink my free time into that instead and last month I was using my Game Boy Pocket a modded one and that was a lot of fun to use but I've got to admit Since switching to this PSP I've had so much fun on here I forgot how good of a console this was for the time and it has been an absolute joy to carry with me honestly this feels fantastic to play and for my larger kind of adult hands now this is just fantastic and it makes me realize how far ahead of the game Sony were of this PSP this plays games and movies and music and you could browse the internet at the time on it it really was a device that kind of did it all and it even had its own proprietary media this is a UMD which is similar to a minidisk but this is a film and all the games came on those as well which is just so fun to see I've mainly been playing God of War ghost of spart on here it really does hold up but there's been some other fun games as well like loo Roo and the metal slug Anthology I've really been enjoying and also at this point in time it's a pretty good emulation device too okay next up is an iPhone accessory that I can't live out and that's this moof SNAP stand invisible tripod for the iPhone this just snaps onto the back of your iPhone like that through magsafe and then you flip it out and you have a tripod which you can use for pretty much anything now I film myself quite a lot for Instagram reels and for taking photos and things like that as a Creator this just makes it nice and easy and it keeps your phone off the floor which is really important it also can hold up your phone in a bunch of different ways as well if you're on the train watching something or playing or anything like that it's just really really useful and it's so slim as well now you're supposed to leave it attached to your phone like that but I generally don't I always keep it in a coat pocket or in my bag or in my pocket or something like that because it's so slim and light it just feels like you're carrying some cards around but I'm generally a huge fan of this I often show it to people that I see because I'm just like isn't this cool and yeah I think it really is great so that's the moft SNAP stand tripod just super super useful lastly for the definitely list there's a few products which I really do think are pretty much perfect but the Apple airpods Pro 2 are one of them these are just such a fantastic pair of earbuds and they just go with me absolutely everywhere and it's one of the things I check when I leave the house you know I pack my pockets down it's phone wallet keys airpods as long as I got all of those I'm good to go and I don't want to talk about them too much because everyone knows airpods are decent but these have got fantastic sound the transparency mode when you want to listen to things around you is really good and some of the updates like being able to use them as hearing aids and being able to just talk and then they'll switch off or go into transparency mode directly is just really cool and those features have come through software upgrades as well so these are kind of just getting better with time and I don't think Apple's done with them yet but yeah absolutely love these the only other ones that have tempted me away from them again have been the nothing ear the new ones the ear 2 or I think they're just called ear now they look great as well but for me the airpods Pro 2 are just Irreplaceable right now okay let's start talking about the Mayes now and the first maybe on the list is the Santa Fe shoulder bag from long weekend this is a small bag pretty much designed with cameras in mind and it's all designed around this kind of retro sort of aesthetic and I really like it initially I've never been a bad guy I never thought like I needed that much stuff when I'm going with me but lately because I've been traveling so much actually when I'm in a city or things like that I do need more stuff than I normally take around with me and this small shoulder bag has been a fantastic way to do that this was made by William vek and funny enough I was in New York City recently and he walked past me and said hey nice bag and I had to do like a double take I was like wait is that him and then I went over and spoke to him about it so I've seen him in person if he's somehow watching this video good job on the bag man it's great stuff the first piece of tech I do have in that bag is this Nintendo controller key ring which I picked up in Japan from a gachapon but this is actually a disguised air tag I opened this up and popped an air tag inside and screwed it back up so now this is a fully trackable Nintendo keyring that idea was given to me by someone in the comments so thank you for that but this has actually been a nice way to hide an air tag and if anyone finds this they probably wouldn't think too much about it so it means that that bag is completely trackable and it looks nice as well another thing on the maybe list is this anchor battery pack now I very very rarely need a battery pack but if I'm traveling around somewhere I usually keep one on me I really like this because it's nice and slim but it also charges through mag saave so you just snap this to your back of your phone and it starts charging up immediately the only issue with it now though is because it's getting older I think and also because it's only 5,000 milliamps it doesn't actually give me that much power when I put my phone on the back I probably get around like 30% charge of it and if I use the wire I'll get 40 to 50% of an iPhone charge now generally speaking my phone basically never ever runs out there been very very few times where I've needed this where I haven't had access to a power socket like overnight but because it's USBC I can use it with any other electronic device as well that needs it like a camera or something like that it does also have this little stand you can charge your phone and you know prop it up while you want to watch something it might actually be time for me to look at an upgrade for this because it makes the phone really hot and this gets really hot and yeah doesn't deliver loads of power however I still really like it it just slips into that little bag no problem at all next up is a huge maybe for me because if you've watched this channel for a while you know that I generally don't use a case on my iPhone but this is an iPhone case and this is the official Apple silicon one and obviously they got me because of this wonderful color I love how this looks but to be honest I don't ever use one because I'm very rarely in a situation where I feel like I'll drop my phone or anything like that but if I do know that I'm going somewhere kind of more risky or somewhere where there's a good chance of me dropping it then I'll slap this case on now ironically because I'm not used to having a case when I hold it with one in I actually feel like I got less of a grip on it and I feel a bit more clumsy with it and apple we've got to do something about the pocket lint situation with these silicon cases as much as I love it when you put it into your pocket pocket and then you take it out of your pocket it just picks up all of the lint and dirt ever so quickly and it just makes it look a bit gross um you know quick wipe gets rid of it but that's something I'd love to see disappear on the later iterations but you know who knows how on Earth they could do that sort of thing next up is one of my favorite bits of tech that I picked up last year and that's the DJI osmo 3 Pocket I absolutely love this camera and I really didn't think I would I didn't think I needed it I've got nice Sony cameras and I've got my iPhone for when I need to capture stuff like this but it's actually been really fantastic it's nice and steady it catches really good quality video which actually looks a little bit better than an iPhone and the best thing about it as well is it's not an iPhone so if I need to leave something somewhere and film myself or anything like that I don't have this nervous worry that my phone will get stolen or anything like that I can just pop the osmo there film everything that I need to you know pass it around to other people ask them to film with it and I don't have to worry at all and I really like it for that it's also kind of just perfectly designed for content if you get the creative combo you get a microphone and an ultra wide and like a nice carry case and everything else and some of the results I've got with it especially in Japan and New York I've just been so happy with and it's just a really nice little device and to be honest it's let me capture little vloggy moments for this channel which I always used to struggled to get before so for me it's worth it for that alone I really love this little thing okay last thing on the maybe's list is the Fujifilm x16 now I am having a real LoveHate relationship with this camera I took it with me to Japan and I got some really really wonderful results things I'm so so so happy with and the out- of camera results from here are stunning too Fuji colors are just great there's no denying that but there's things I struggle with I think the autofocus is really slow yes of course it's never going to match a Sony or something like that but if you're trying to grab something kind of quickly if you're walking past it doesn't always hit which I find kind of frustrating and the 35 mm focal length I find on it relatively tricky to deal with it's neither close nor kind of far away and I often just end up zooming in with the digital Zoom to kind of get like a more 50 mil equivalent because the autofocus was kind of slow you know when I was away I was reaching for my phone more than I was for this because I could trust my phone to get the picture in the moment where I wasn't so confident with this so while there's loads of things I love about this camera there's also an equal amount of things which I kind of don't like about it maybe I just need to spend more money and get a like a Q3 or something like that so there you have it there's all of my tech everyday carry for 2025 I hope you enjoyed the video if you did pop a like if you got any suggestions for things for me to check out then let me know in the comments below because I love to hear what you have to say and as ever I will see you all in the next one [Music] oh",1,The video transcript does not contain any claims lacking credible evidence

right now as is actually doing myself in for real it's time to talk about the iPhone 16e at 600 this is now Apple's most affordable blower as they finally taken the lame old se3 around the back of the bar and put it out of its misery hopefully by kicking it to death with concrete shoes of course you couldn't call the iPhone 16 e cheap or indeed even really affordable unless you just happen to be a spoiled middle-aged brat with the personality of a constipated Bulldog so anyway you asked for it kides here's my iPhone 16e review and for more on the latest and greatest Tech or just overpriced toss like this please do POG subscribe and ding that notifications Bell cheers now the one good thing about the iPhone se3 and I do mean the one good thing was the pleasingly compact design well the iPhone 16e has grown a wee bit but only to 6.1 in although those old school bezels are horribly thick so the phone itself isn't quite as mini as you might hope and of course all the standard Apple trops are present and correct the flat edges and the antagonizing the sharp corners but thankfully because it is a bit more dinky the iPhone 16e isn't as uncomfortable to clutch as a pissed off porcupine unlike The Who and great m M withth iPhone 16 Pro Max and the iPhone 16 e basts beautiful design that is Drop Dead Gorgeous at least it does according to Apple's marketing department who I can only imagine are kept chained in a basement somewhere in Silicon Valley and forced to watch endless reruns of Jordy Shaw until whatever remains of their traumatized Consciousness vomits out a string of nonsensical Whimsy that cook and cor can slap on a poster preferably some Childish jumble of words that makes literally bugger all sense like future proof your fast for instance it's a bit of a tossup whether that one was written by a toddler with early onset dementia or apple intelligence but hey don't want to get ahead of myself plenty more on that little beauty later on let's check I've got my whiskey handy anyway I'm going off on one now the point is that Apple's iPhone 16 e is beautiful in the same way that a serial killer thinks that someone's kidney flopping about on their kitchen table is beautiful it'll certainly take a special kind of mind to appreciate these rather Bland Aesthetics and for some absolutely incomprehensible reason Apple isn't even offering the 16e and the same vibrant Vivid selection of colors as the standard iPhone 16 your choices here or black or white no bold Hues for you pors who can't afford a proper iPhone in better news at least the camera bump the singular camera bump is rather slight although yeah yes the iPhone 16 e does Still Tremble like a sh in poodle when it's sat on a desk or table now sadly that touch ID sensor is finally dead it's worm food rough it did always take up a big old bulk of that front end I don't know why Apple never got around to slapping one on the back so now on the face ID remains sadly still no way of getting it to actually unlock straight to your desktops you still have to swipe the bloody thing every single time unless of course you use one of the now standard hacks like the double back tap to unlock to your desktops which sometimes works there you go as you can see miles more convenient but thankfully face ID itself works really well as always pretty fast and generally works even in very low light conditions has no problem recognizing me even if I'm weeping under my Dove or having a nice little cry session in the shower and oh yes the iPhone 16e is of course fully water resistant so while the phone itself remains coldly Indi as your tears splash down across its colorless frame at least all that moisture warn bollocks it up Al though if the screen is even slightly wet that does BK the responsiveness now despite costing 600 quids the iPhone 16 sadly comes with a rather Mega 120 gigs of storage which as you can see there I've used up the bulk of that already in what two fraking weeks though a large portion of the blame certainly rests on the shoulders of genin and Wen waves the bloed ball bags that they are if you fancy a decent amount of storage you'll have to stuff even more scratch into Timmy Cook's gusset especially as this bugger all micro SD memory card expandability here and I've had a go at Samsung and googleing them for exactly the same Shin diggery 128 gigs as standard in the likes of the pixel 9 and the Samsung Galaxy s25 flagships which frankly it's just not good enough in 2025 especially for gamers as you see download two fraking titles that's pretty much your entire storage wiped out and then if you want to just take a few photos and videos on your phone God forbid you're basically out of luck it's especially unacceptable when quite a few mid-rangers these days come with 256 gigs as standard that likes the nothing phone 3A Pro and even Samsung's on Galaxy a56 256 as standard here in the UK and then even worse here on the iPhone 16 e Apple will rip an extra bonus 100 pond out of your wallet just to get you up to a respectable level so that's £700 you're now spending on an affordable phone already getting angry and we haven't even touched on iOS or apple intelligence yet and calm now the software of course is good old iOS 16 complete with a reported 5 years of support which isn't quite as good as Google Samsung Etc but it's still pretty decent it's basically the same old iOS that you get on other iPhones except with some of the worst bits from yester year fully reinstated so for example you can only see a tiny weed chunk of the status bar so good luck figuring out if you've actually got any notifications waiting for you or whatever and even worse there's absolutely no always on display in 2025 I feel like I should be slopping out in the street right now cuz this is some medieval right here it's not all terrible news thankfully you do have a couple of modern Apple improvements including the old action button SLA there above the volume buttons just close enough so you'll occasionally mistake it for the volume up and as before this ties into shortcuts so it's effectively a macro button that you can perform to open any app or basically run any specific task including some of Apple's recent stabs at AI oh Apple intelligence now Apple has been rather heavily marketing this stuff as one of the key features of the latest iPhones even though it's actually about as smart as the brown stuff I script at the bottom of my pond or the average Premier League footballer so for instance you got the same pointless writing tool slapped on the likes of Samsung and xiaomi blowers this can rewrite your message to make you sound slightly less like an idiot or marginally more sober at least but it generally doesn't work very well you've also got a proof readen tool which is probably quite a good idea after Apple's auto correct toss has swaps the words you meant to type for nonsensical bollocks youve also got the same equally pointless image generation tool which is seemingly incapable of spaffing out anything you actually ask for so for example let's ask for a rabbit pulling a magician out of a hat you need to choose what your person looks like so yeah just go for that one Whatever yep done and then what do we get me as a magician with a tiny wand and some other weird stuff floting about in the air and a rabbit just kind of shoved there off to the S side excellent me again just as a magician me as a rabbit masquerading as a magician yeah I mean you get the idea I'm also going to try asking for a Teenage Mutant Ninja capibara and what I get is a mouse in an 80 style puffer jacket with a sweatband last attempt an iPhone that is actually good unable to use that description just too outlandish a concept I guess meanwhile the Gen Moji tool is exactly the same except for emojis you know those annoying things that people use when they can't be bothered to respond to you with actual words like when you message your dad Hey I just heard that Uncle Kevin is in prison again what happened this time and he simply responds back with scared cat orine skull and cross bores some of these work all right the cucumber and a couple of eggs came out exactly as I'd planned at least in one of the offerings one of them was also a cucumber egg which was kind of I don't know a nerfing really but more of often than not as usual you won't get what you want and it's just a frustrating exercise at this point I decided you know what I'd rather H myself into the nearest thresher than waste another precious moment of existence doing this you can also get your voice recordings Etc transcribed although this is just as shunky here on the iPhone 16 e as with most other phones that's possibly down to my general northernness however so I will let this one slide one of the best apple intell features by which I mean one of the only ones that isn't complete bollocks is hidden away in the Safari browser you still got the reader mode which is a bit of a cracker just eliminating all of the ads and annoying Chief and just leaving you with the actual article itself and this now includes a respectable stab at summarizing every web page on demand the results can be rather cursory at times missing large amounts of important info but it's still surprisingly unack and then of course you got the AI photo editing tool such as cleanup which can allow you to remove any background Shenanigans going on any other people lurking in your photo ruining the atmos so let's try getting rid of these two dudes yeah it's kind of bky but it's not terrible as for the much hyped visual intelligence well this is essentially just Google Lens except almost a decade later and total trouser and pointed at something and you might get a popup explaining what it is but only if it's something simple like an animal or a plant and even then Apple intelligence usually just shrugs its shoulders in a non-committal way I don't know might be that whatever man in all the adverts they just a this thing at a restaurant and they can immediately pull up menus and make a reservation there all kinds of happy fun times I've tried pointing this thing at pubs restaurants shops everything I come across sweet aate so almost always your options are basically to ask chat GPT about whatever it is you've spotted or just perform a Google image search which is usually pretty good because it's Google not Apple so where actually is the Apple intelligence here honestly I reckon someone might have lobotomized this thing before I took it out of theing box and then oh boy then there's Siri which has now been upgraded with apple intelligence apparently which frankly is like trying to make a rock smarter by repeatedly beating it with a dictionary where's my nearest test go sorry something went wrong what can you actually do hello hello hey hello sorry something went wrong find me other films by Sha Baker on Netflix okay this is this is just on Apple TV you massive liar Jesus Christ uh no it was it it wasn't even a question mate open up the camera app and take a selfie of me to record how absolutely thrilled my face looks right now yeah banging and you know the likes of Gemini aren't perfect but at least chatting with it feels like you're having a conversation with a reasonably rational adult well speaking with Siri feels like arguing with a petulent child so in summary kitties Siri and apple intelligence can get right in a pit and then you can fill that pit with acid and also H in some acid proof dynamite and some acid and dynamite proof Lions which you might possibly have to grow in some sort of special lab oh Christ I feel like I've been talking about the iPhone 16 e for years now so let's have a brief intermission your uncle spur needs to refuel oh God okay we're going to get through this so next up let's chat about the iPhone 16 super retina xdr OLED display and of course the iPhone 16 haralds the witless return of that fugly scrotum Notch dangling right there into view a reprisal that's about as welcome as the resurrection of Jimmy savl as a fro and sex pest robot it is slightly dimmer than the standard model but still bright enough to use Outdoors no worries although it's usually far too bright in the mornings when I first scrape the gunk out of my eyes despite the fact that I've got auto brightness enabled those visuals are pin sharp and rather Punchy but the deal breaker for me is absolutely the 60 HZ refresh even to my degraded old eyeballs which were absolutely worn out after 2 and a half Decades of Internet abuse this thing is just horrendously Judy I mean I'm so used to Silky Smooth 120 HZ Refresh on even the most basic 100b Android phones so skimming through this UI and just apps in general feels like you're flicking your way through trle thankfully the stereo speakers are actually fine that's it no snark or negativity they're actually perfectly okay a little bit distorted when you bump the volume right up but nothing that makes the vein in my temples throb unaware I completely forgot to mention the ticking see one evening for seemingly bugger all reason the earpiece speaker here on the iPhone 16 AG you started making this really loud ticking sound I honestly thought this phone was just going to suddenly explode which frankly would have come as something of a relief even if it had been wedged in my Pan's pocket at the time i' have happily put up with some roasted nuts to dodge I'm to do this review and be a small price appear especially compared to the actual price that I appeared for this bloody thing and now let's prance our way merrily onto the subject of performance and the iPhone 16e is powered by a slightly stripped back four core version of Apple's a18 chipset but of course even if this chunkster had a Snapdragon e toite stuffed inside it would still feel slower than an elderly sloth that's had its knees kicked in all because of that antic 60 HZ display all the same I was expecting the iPhone 16e to effortlessly blaze through games like genjin impact after all of Apple's future proof your Fast wibbling And yet on the higher Graphics settings the game was surprisingly jery I mean it never descended into a weir fut tastic slideshot but as soon as a few NPCs popped up together that frame rate regularly dipped below 30 frames per second I'm not really entirely sure why the phone got a little bit hot but not too toasty but anyway yeah that's another of this phone's key selling points that apparently turns out to be a hot bag of broken promises bit of a bizarre one that' be interesting to hear from any other 16e owners if they've had a similar sort of experience as well and of course the 16e notable for the fact that Apple has slapped its own C1 modem I believe it's called in here and I found the connectivity has been fine here on the iPhone 16e the last couple of weeks there's Bug roll support for millimeter wave 5G but then more often than not you're stuck on good old sub six anyway can be quite lethargic when I Venture into Central London but then that's not massively rare anyway and this thing Peaks at WiFi six there's Bug roll Wi-Fi 7 support and likewise no Ultra wideband support on this thing either which most people probably won't even notice unless you want to use good old Air tags which case now as usual there's buger all mention of V actual battery capacity on Apple's web page although if you like you can compare the alleged battery life of the iPhone 16e with other iPhones on Apple's website as long as you don't want to compare with anything beyond the iPhone 12 or the iPhone se3 that is not at all suspect that but the fact is the battery life for the iPhone 16e is actually really really good in fact it's absolutely the highlight of this thing there may be an overpriced antique but hey at least it won't feel on you before you're all tucked up with Teddy at night so after a reasonably long day with a fair bit of camera play plenty of audio streaming on Spotify etc etc usually around 6 to 7 hours of screen on time in total I've usually still got at least a third of that battery life left in the tank although yes of course this is massively helped by simple features like always on display not actually being there unfortunately when it comes to the charging Shenanigans well news not quite so cheery the iPhone 16e supports slow as Falls 20 W wired charging so just like Samsung's Galaxy s25 even though the capacity probably isn't huge it'll still take well over an hour to power this thing back up again when it's drained there's certainly no point in bunging a cable in it for 5 minutes to do an emergency charge before you dash out the door you might as well shove it down the front of your trousers and dance the Macarena for all the good it'll do you and yeah wireless charging 7.5 wats so tediously slow and of course there's absolutely SLE support for mag safe which has been a major headline these past couple of weeks but hey at least the buggers didn't bring back good old lightning along with that God awful Notch thing that's something because the sodn EU won't let them now it's a good old modern bit of USB action instead USB 2 that is and according to Apple the iPhone 16 e comes with a camera so Advanced it's like getting two in one but you don't you just get the one it's nothing like having two cameras it's like having precisely One camera which is what it is and it's merely fine and personally I got to say I don't really miss the ultra wide it's something I on the occasionally play around with anyway considerably more useful would be an actual proper portrait shooter with proper optical zoom or just a telephoto Snapper in general which you do get on a lot of Androids of this sort of price point and of course Apple will try and fool you into thinking that the iPhone 16 e has has a proper telepo type ability with all of its Swagger chat about two times optical zoom when all it's merely doing is cropping into the image like what any other phone can do you'll also notice a complete lack of a dedicated camera button here on the edge of the iPhone 16e just like with the regular iPhone 16 and personally for me that is a plus point cuz on the iPhone 16 Pro Max that button was about as helpful as a Duncan Donuts in a diabetes cck clinic but how does the single 48 megapix shooter fair in 2025 well it is fine as a simple point and shoot effort on par with stuff like the Galaxy a56 and the nothing phone 3A you'll get the usual applified photos spaffed out with the brightness boosted to retina singen levels so everything is nicely saturated detail levels are usually pretty good even in more ambient conditions while the iPhone 16e doesn't drop a bollock in the evenings although as usual any nighttime scenarios with strong contrast will result in flaring and extreme saturation you've got the obligatory portrait Shenanigans stuffed on here which usually work well despite the single sensor setup although if your subject dares to move with or without portrait mode the chances are they will be blurrier than my vision after 12 pints of swore figure not your bog standard swar figure of course oh no I'm talking about SW figure jizer the choice of sophisticated substance abusers the iPhone 16e can also record 4K resolution video with Dolby Vision support and my test footage from the past few weeks all looks rather lovely you got pretty sharp visuals respectable stabilization the audio pickup is fine as well a little bit muted when you're facing the screen but nothing to really mourn about at all here so isn't that lovely a nice positive finish to a review which has probably taken about 5 years off of my life span oh and of course yes you've got a selfie camera up front which is again perfectly fine and with the iPhone's front facing camera you can shoot 4K footage at up to 30 frames per second really advanced stuff for a 600 smartphone where the bloody hell am I and there you have it my lovelies we did it the iPhone 16 review in the bag don't have to touch another one of these bloody things for another few months and yes on the whole got to say pretty negative thoughts and feel feelings towards this thing but the most damning review of the iPhone 16e is probably all of those Americans who say hey you know what this is the iPhone that you give to your mom basically suggesting that the daff doery won't know any better about all the many deficiencies of this thing because you know she's old as you know I'm sure that some people will still buy it saying you know the usual excuse is oh I know I know it's not great but you know I've got to have an iPhone absolutely so used to having an iPhone which to me is kind of like saying oh I know it's a little bit awkward but I've just absolutely got to live in a house that's on fire I'm just so used to living in a house that's constantly burning all around me I mean just maybe just for once just try living in a house that isn't on fire see what you reckon you might like it oh but it's just hassle isn't it and you know if I was living in a house that wasn't on fire I'd probably just feel a bit cold but anyway the main takeaway here is definitely do do not buy the iPhone 16 e under any circumstances and also apparently all Americans hit their mothers if I had to sum it up in high coup form it would be rather stick my knob inside aing wasp's nest than my Sim in this but what about you kitties have you had the iPhone 16e stashed in your shorts handbag whatever well definitely let us know what you reckon are you regretting your decision to purchase this thing or are you you a bit in the head now definitely let us know in the comments below and would you like me to compare the iPhone 16 e to any actually good phones well again just taply tap down below and uh maybe I'll I'll do another video on this sucker and please do poke subscribe and ding that notifications bell all the usual YouTube Guff and thank you for joining me on this I don't even know how to

360}}",UCzlXf-yUIaOpOjEjPrOO9TA,Ar9SYzCxNLk,1075,238228,en,Ar9SYzCxNLk,look at that holy moly look at that hold up stop the presses as my review was about to go live today I had a statement come through from Oppo saying I'll just read it verbatim at Oppo we carefully tailor our product launches to each region based on in-depth market research strategic strategic priorities the find N5 will not be launching in Europe and therefore I guess by the UK instead in q1 2025 we will introduce the Reno 13 series across Europe on February 24th well that's hugely disappointing uh we were strongly led to believe the fin N5 would be getting a global launch even the verges review which I just checked among other ones all say yes it's not coming to the US but the UK and Europe gets it it's a global launch they even had a London briefing and obviously at the launch event of the N5 they gave Singaporean pricing 2499 SGD but they were a little bit uh quiet on what it would be elsewhere and it turns out there is no elsewhere so I suppose except for Singapore China and maybe a handful of countries in Asia no one else will be able to buy nn5 which is even more disappointing not just because I spent about two weeks making this video which is still valid by the way everything I say in this review so hopefully you still stick around and watch the rest of it but also because the OnePlus 2 has been effectively cancelled so Samsung and hono and Vivo will be very happy about this I still maintain this is the best foldable phone uh and I was going to say that you can buy but now ASX that you probably can't buy hopefully you still enjoy enjoy the video this is the new Oppo Find N5 it's a sunny day in London and this doesn't happen very often over winter so I brought myself up outside we're in trafala square right now but I want to talk about this the N5 because while I don't know how many people actually buy foldable phones clearly enough because they keep making them and this doesn't fundamentally fix any of the issues that you have with a foldable being very expensive and also you know how often do you actually utilize this tablet screen if you want to watch movies and things it's letter box so this is not for everyone but if you fancy yourself a bit of a pro user and fancy having a tablet you can put in your pocket well hands down this is the best foldable you could buy right now although that is cheating a little bit because it's also the first Flagship foldable launch we've had in 2085 so what makes this M5 so special well I think firstly it's the successor to one of my all-time favorite foldables the OnePlus open this actually came out in 2023 it has the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 it's quite chunky actually but I really love this phone uh and we haven't had a success of a squl until now with the N5 now sadly it has been confirmed that we won't be getting a OnePlus open 2 instead OnePlus is basically just putting all their weight behind their parent company's phone with the Oppo N5 because the N3 and the open were basically the same phone just rebadged for different territories except for the fact that this runs color OS rather than oxygen OS in all but name this is the OnePlus open 2 which is why immediately and very excited to BU it it's also the first Flagship followable of 2025 which means this packs in the Snapdragon 8 Elite it's the first foldable phone to offer the latest chip from Snapdragon although it is a slightly lower power version they've actually dropped or perhaps even just disabled one of the cores uh so the actual multi-core score will be a little bit lower compared to other Snapdragon 8 Elite phones but otherwise they're identical same Graphics same mpu same ISP for the camera and I think it was the smart choice to balance that performance with efficiency and uh you know power consumption thermals given this form factor so it's the successor to the OnePlus open it has the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chip it's also the thinnest book style foldable on the market technically the Huawei trifold uh when unfolded is a little bit thinner but this beats everything else out there including what you get from Vivo and honor and especially Samsung next to the Samsung Galaxy Zed fold 6 it's about a third thinner that really is crazy given that these are direct Rivals and in many ways this is a superior phone they've barely been able to squeeze in the USBC Port there you can see how thin that frame is around it this is actually 4.21 mm when open compared to 5.6 mm on the Galaxy Zed fold 6 it's a good deal thinner as you can see so it's thinner it's also 10 G lighter than the fold 6 and while also giving you more screen space you can see the overall footprint is actually a little bit bigger than the fold 6 nothing wrong with the fold six but just in terms of having the bigger screens in your pocket you can't go wrong with the M5 and crucially when it comes to folds that bloody thing in the in the middle the crease which has made foldables a bit uncomfortable to use uh since their Inception with the original Galaxy fold obviously every generation they have improved and the fold six is a little bit better than the fold five but side by side with the N5 firstly you can see that anti-reflective screen doing its work reducing my studio light but you can also see how much less obvious how much more subtle that crease is this is hands down the most impressive and by impressive I mean most subtle crease I've ever used on a foldable the magic 3 and also Vios xfold 3 Pro whatever it's called are very similar but this I think just takes the win and also is noticeably Slimmer in terms of width than the original OnePlus open of the N3 so on the outside you have this comfortable 6.62 in screen uh with a pretty regular smartphone form factor aspect ratio and it's a good deal wider than even the new fold 6 but then it opens up to this massive 8.12 in tablet screen essentially as Square as most of these foldables are when they open up and actually this is the biggest foldable you can get in terms of the outer and the cover screen and apparently this even has a slightly bigger surface area than an iPad Mini although bear in mind that's probably a third of the price of this so you could buy a iPhone and an iPad anyway the point is it's Allin one and obviously you are paying impr premium for the fact that it folds into a regular smartphone form factor so this is the black model but it also comes in a white which I do think is a little bit more eye-catching than this it's obviously quite subtle and nice and you also have this black aluminum frame on the outside I would personally go for the white one if I was going to buy this myself and overall it's a very smart looking foldable my only complaint is just how high the volume rocker and the power is up here on the right hand side of the phone the power button also doubles as a fingerprint reader so you really have to sort of finger your way up that sounds weird uh to the power button and even higher for the volume rocker which is right up the top of the phone couple of other thoughts since I've been using this on the design the speakers aren't the best I've used they are lacking a little bit in Bas and richness they're fine they're not bad by any stretch but just not the best speakers similarly the haptic motor in here is actually quite weak uh even compared to other Oppo phones compared to other foldable phones so the haptic feedback the vibration just a little bit um weak let's just say and if you're thinking oh that's all lovely Tom but what about an S Pen stylus the fold six has one of those well so does this you also have to buy it separately as you do with the fold six but this supports the Oppo pen so if you do want to have more refined Doodles and drawing and utilize the space for some artsy creative stuff then you can buy the Oppo pen and use it with this now obviously the main selling point of a foldable is a big old tablet screen but I also love the fact that you have the front cover screen particularly for taking photos and if you are by yourself or taking a group selfie what you can do in the camera app is uh do the cover screen preview that's not new of course uh We've also got full cover screen control so it brings the whole UI to the front alter screen and then you can use a little palm gesture to take a photo or start recording or you can you know use the volume down or the regular button like that so being able to frame yourself use Palm gestures and then take a selfie or a group photo with the higher quality rear cameras and not rely on these not so good selfie cameras one of my absolute favorite things about having AFF foldable as for the screens themselves they both look lovely they have 1 to 12 120 HZ Dynamic refresh rates 2160 HZ pwm so it's actually a little bit more comfortable for your eyes particularly at lower brightnesses both both screens support W vision and HDR 10 plus and the inner tablet screen also has this anti-reflective coating which helps reduce Reflections and glare and actually makes it a lot easier to use outside the cover screen can get a touch brighter but the internal tablet screen does have the anti-reflective coating obviously the main worry when you have a foldable this thin and light and also this expensive is durability I've only had this for a couple of weeks so I will continue to use it and report back in a longer term review but so far so good I've been opening it with my hand like this all day long and if there's been no problems I wouldn't really recommend that but I just want to you know see if it actually breaks and they've actually improved the toughness of both the screens with the outer screen now 20% stronger for drop resistance and 10% more scratch resistant whilst the inner screen is 70% stronger with a new anti-shock film which apparently improves shock resistance by 70% they've also beefed up the water resistance we've got ipx6 ipx8 and new for this year ipx9 so it can withstand hot Jets of water still no dust resistance though which is a bit frustrating given that's probably the main thing you'd be worried about with these canones dust Ingress but certainly this is incredibly water resistant to the point where I feel comfortable being in Chala Square got a few looks doing that no problem at all so it's the thinnest it's the lightest it has the most subtle crease it has the new chip and therefore it's the fastest foldable you can buy right now even with that one reduced multicore and also it's the coolest I actually ran a big foldable battery test the other day Not only was the new N5 the coolest phone in terms of exterior Peak temperature after playing a game for 15 minutes compared to the rest of these guys but it also had the best battery by some margin despite the size of this Oppo have crammed in a 5600 mAh battery which actually is a little bit smaller than what Vivo has in theirs but presumably with the more efficient Snapdragon 8 Elite chip this actually lasts about an hour longer than even the Vivo which comes in second place but the N5 was still the clear winner and actually lasted about 25 to 30% longer than the open the N3 I mean the engineering behind this thing is just incredible this is one of the batteries their silicon carbon battery design but it's just 2.1 mm thick and with a dual cell Design This adds up to a 5600 mAh battery with support for 80 w super vuk wi charging and impressively despite how thin this is they have managed to add support for wireless charging in fact up to 50 WS air vot charging if you Splash out for one of their Chargers it's an optional extra of course however the phone doesn't have magnets in it there's not enough room for them so while this is fine if it's laid flat it will just slide off because it hasn't got magnets so what you'll want to do is buy the optional extra magnetic wireless charging case which then will allow you to tach it to say mag safe accessories and it won't just FL off now for this review sample that I was given I did get a charger in the box and it's actually a UK plug which suggests the UK Market may get a charger but Oppo said that it will vary based on regions where you live whether you get a charger in the box or not as with any foldable or flip phone you have to come in with the expectation that the camera will not be as good as is traditional rectangular counterparts simply because they do not have the same room to fit in the same sensors essentially we have a triple camera setup a 50 megapix main as well as an 8 megap Ultra wide and a 50 megapix three times telephoto Zoom plus a couple of well pretty rubbish 8 megapixel cameras for the selfie and the tablet screen so while this borrows the same main camera as the Oppo X8 which is very good it's not at the level of an X8 Pro the sensor is smaller we do also have a pretty decent 50 megapixel telephoto which gives us a three times zoom and a six times lossless zoom and they've also now added their AI telescope Zoom so when you go beyond 10 times it uses more Ai and processing to improve the images and actually longer range Zoom is very good for a foldable and they've also in roduced a teley macro photo mode so you can get some nice really close up photos using the zoom camera what isn't so good is the ultra white camera it's borderline bad especially in lower light 8 megapixels f2.2 it does support autofocus but genuinely image quality from this Ultra wide is pretty poor it's certainly the weakest point of this camera system I suppose the good news though at least for me is that that's the lens that I use the least and the main camera and the telephoto are actually very good I would say they're comparable with the Galaxy fold 6 and in some cases actually a little bit better but you be the judge let me show you a whole bunch of side by sides shot on the M5 and also the fold 6 with the latest software on both and while they share similar specs for the main camera the Oppo actually has a much bigger sensor for the telephoto lens although the fold does have a much better Ultra wide the main difference between the two is the color science and I've also found that the Oppo generally gives us a slightly more contrasty more shadowy look which you may prefer it's more cinematic more filmic more viby I would say that the main cameras are comparable they're basically on par in terms of performance but I would also say the F six is significantly better for the ultra wide but the neppo is slightly better in terms of portraits and zooming in although I have found for longer range portraits sometimes the blur the bouquet can be a little bit off and actually the Samsung does a better job as for video well let's kick off with a poem which was very kindly written by this gentleman hanging out in triaga square I did pay him2 for his service and I said made me a poem R me a poem about a foldable phone and uh this is what he came up with feel free to pause the video and have a full read through if you like but it's very profound as for video quality well genuinely it's pretty good especially if you have nice lighting and just panning around Square here lovely light and it looks good it's sharp colors are natural but I have found in trickier lighting conditions the quality can drop quite significantly by far the worst aspect of the camera though is you guessed it the ultra wide which doesn't even let you shoot 4K 60 tops out at 4K 30 and the quality is just pretty awful so I never really end up using it the video quality isn't quite what I expected and actually I thought it looked better watching it back on the phone screen but then also put it on my laptop and edit it into this video was a little bit less impressed zooming in the stabilization is actually better than I expected but even just casually walking there's always this vibration there's also no option to shoot in 8k which isn't the end of the world but it would have been nice if we had the ability to shoot in log which you can do on the iPhone the s25 and xiaomi phones you can record in Dolby Vision HDR but as I say there's no log option here so in terms of the m5's overall camera quality I'd say photos 8 out of 10 video seven so both these foldables offer good camera systems but as I say they are not as good as their rectangular traditional counterparts if you do want the absolute best camera then get yourself an s25 ultra or a Oppo X8 Pro so this is running Android 15 with oppo's color OS on top as I say I do prefer oxygen OS which we got on the OnePlus open but well that's not happening but I must admit this is still very nice to use and it's actually quite optimized for a foldable like this this for example if I open Google Maps over here I can swipe down two fingers to bring up split view I could then say bring up Instagram nice you know side by side up like that I can swap SIDS I can do a top bottom split and if I bring up either the task bar or the edge sidebar here I can then bring in a third app and now I have what they call boundless view with these three apps in split screen which I can jump between and you can also save your app layouts uh onto the desktop here so then with a single press I have the layout of the apps that I like you've got this app library and recent files which open up on top of any other app you're using so you can open a file you can drag a photo into a specific app and as usual for foldables like this there are a handful of apps that take advantage of flex mode and this also comes in handy for the new o plus connect which actually now lets you have a full remote desktop from your Mac on your phone so the bottom side of the screen can be your keyboard or a trackpad with a display on the top half this o plus connect may just be one of my favorite features because I do use a Macbook as is my main work laptop and one of the advantages of course of using an iPhone is airdrop and the continuity between all that hardware and software but with OP plus connect I can remotely access my phone from my Mac and then drag and drop files and photos and now you have access to a full remote desktop feature although I think this is currently in beta and it does take a few minutes to set up the first time you do it there's lots of permissions you have to Grant so to share photos and files via o connect you do need to be on the same Wi-Fi network as the laptop however the remote control only requires that they're both connected to the internet they don't have to be on the same network you've also got Google's Gemini baked in the AI system which you can open up via a long press of the power button and of course there's a whole bunch of AI Fe you to play with whether you're AI erasing in the photo gallery or removing Reflections or your summarizing notes the usual cast stuff that you would expect on a new phone I also appreciate it supports eims and Wi-Fi calling neither of which are guaranteed from Chinese phones more importantly though is the software support and Oppo promise for years of os upgrades with a fifth year of security so we are getting some nice support from Oppo although not the seven years that you get from Samsung as for all important pricing what we do know is it will cost $2500 in Singapore if you did stick around for that entire review even though you know that you can't buy this well I appreciate it thank you for watching and hopefully it was useful for you guys and I'll see you next time right here on the tech chat,1,The video transcript provided is a detailed review of the Oppo Find N5 foldable phone.

number of actual upgrades on this here Galaxy s25 versus last year's s24 can pretty much be counted on one finger but it is a biggie the fresh new Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset which replaces The turdy Exodus effort from before but is the Galaxy s25 a dinky Delight or has that Frosty reception been all too AP well I've had my sim secreted inside for just over a week now so here's my Galaxy s25 review and for more on the latest and greatest dech please do poke subscribe and ding that notifications Bell cheers now undoubtedly the best thing about Samsung's vanilla Galaxy s25 versus the plus and the ultra is the fact that it's one of the only compact handsets you'll actually find these days and 6.2 in might not sound particularly Tiny But compared to the bloody plus and the ultra models it's positively microscopic I've always been a fan of smaller smartphones so having the s25 clutched in my grip just gives me it's that lovely warm glowing feeling deep inside my belly like a small child unwrapping their first present on Christmas deer or Nigel farage seeing a refugee being torn Lim from Li by a pack of Reid wolves and Samsung Galaxy s25 is impressively slender as well just a cockroach's chuff over 7 Ms now as long as you ignore the Pokey out camera bits that is which thankfully on the stick out a wee bit and when the s25 is resting on a desk or a table and you're jabbing away at the screen thankfully there's not too much shifting around rocking motion going on the Galaxy s25 certainly feels like a premium device as well as you'd kind of Hope from a phone that costs 800 bloody quid it's got a decent we heft for such a dinky device and of course you got Samsung's usual armor aluminium frame plus a bit of Gorilla Glass victus 2 front and back and so far touchwood this Sami blower is still looking box fresh from all angles even without the benefits of a pre-installed screen protector which always makes me a wee bit nervous of course I would still say as always slap a screen protector on there if you can cuz there's nothing worse than having an ugly gouge right there down the middle of your bloody display that you have to stare at every single day of your life full ip68 water resistance again so no worries if you want to do some tick tocking in the shower or whatever it's all good as usual Samsung is offering the Galaxy s25 in a respectable selection of colors and I'm still a big fan of this here mint model it does basically just look silver in dimmer light but out in the warm glow of day it's got that lovely fresh greeny Hue gives me a proper cven for a stick of iges now no real changes when it comes to the screen Tech you've once again got a dynamic AMOLED 2x display with a full HD Plus resolution just like the s24 and 6.2 in it is charmingly Compact and yeah movie fans and Gamers will get a clear r view of the action on pretty much any other smartphone but I was happy enough to watch a nerdy anime or hardcore pornography on here did I say hardcore pornography I meant reruns of Last of the Summer Wine it's your typical Samsung output here so warm bold and easy on the eye and of course gorgeous contrast as well no Dolby Vision support as usual but full hdr10 streaming support and you can tweak the colors in the display settings if you want to if you want to just dial back the warmth of those tones of bit though it doesn't really make a massive difference to be perfectly honest and know unlike the Galaxy s25 Ultra there's no armor glass here so Reflections aren't tempered at all but thankfully that screen does Peak at over 2,000 nits now so comfortable enough for outdoor use however when it comes to the pwm demmon Samsung once again hasn't commented on the exact rate here on the Galaxy s25 display but it sounds by all accounts that it hasn't improved at all over the previous generation or if it has improved it's only improved a wee bit now personally I'm fortunate enough to not be sensitive to OLED Flicker at all so I've had no problems using the s25 in a completely pitch black room for a good couple of hours continuously be it streaming a bit of Netflix or YouTube or just reading or whatever if you are sensitive to alled flicker just bear in mind that the s25 might not be as good for you as some other flagships as for the stereo speaker setup here on the Galaxy s25 well this thing might be dinky but let me tell you it can absolutely sh out some proper full-on audio certainly loud enough when you max out that volume to clearly hear what's going on in your bit of YouTube or whatever even if there's an impromptu Wicked rendition going on right behind you any owners of small musically inclined children should know exactly what I'm talking about there let me just give you a weed taster no big secret that I'm not exactly a massive fan of the iPhone se3 frankly I think it's a tragedy right up there with the de that Elon musk's Dad forgot to pull out now obviously not quite as loud as some bigger Rivals could do with being a wee bit more Beery as well and yes the bottom speaker does punch slightly harder than the top speaker but overall great stuff for something that's this dinky now the true highlight of the galaxy s25 is the Snapdragon eite for Galaxy that's crammed inside of here and yes it is the eite for Galaxy because basically the two prime cores have been given a bit of a kick up the and overclocked and Samsung is now stuffing 12 gigs of ram in all of its devices including the bass s25 to help power all of that lovely AI bollocks but it also helps with any gaming type shenanigans that you might fancy including of course a wonderful spot of we and waves nothing like beating the snot out of random Wildlife to cheer you up on a miserable February morning with those visuals maxed out I found that the Galaxy s25 could maintain a perfectly fluid frame rate a very different experience to last year's Galaxy s24 four which was powered by that exen as bollocks and spaffed out a pretty choppy Affair in the likes of genjin and wther and waves at times the fun that Wan played fine on the more compact screen as well everything was perfectly responsive and Samsung has also managed to find room inside of that Slimmer chassis for a slightly enlarged Vapor chamber it's now 15% bigger apparently compared with the s24 and this combined with the impressive Snapdragon smarts definitely does the job cuz this s25 never overheated even when I was shooting loads of 4K video or gaming for well over an hour so thankfully the overclocking doesn't seem to have any real world impact causing any throttling issues with the likes of we and waves even when running again on those lovely maxed out visuals and oh yeah Samsung has finally sorted out its gaming mode so you no longer have to dig around in the notifications to get this up it got a decent selection of features in there including customizable performance Shenanigans for each of your individual games but one about the battery life well often a Bor of contention for the smaller more compact Galaxy S Series member because it's got a dinky 4,000 mAh battery exactly the same as last year's s24 but got said this past week the s25 has both surprised and impressed me mostly is I get around 5 to 6 hours of screen on time plenty of mixed juice so you know video streaming good bit of camera play obviously testing out the Optics occasional video chat all that kind of shenanigans and I usually end the day with with around 25 to 30% battery life remaining as long as I haven't been gaming on the thing and that's compared with previous dinky S Series smartphones where I've generally been balls deep in power saving mode by around sort 7 8 p.m. and yes even when the s25 is hibernating I'm usually streaming something on Audible or Spotify in the background as well so impressive stuff all around and yes I have gone into the app settings and disabled background power management for quite a few of the apps as well just to make sure I kept on getting the notifications and everything nothing was being put to sleep without my explicit consent however I have found that gaming on the s25 does tend to sap the battery life at an inconsistent rate sometimes when I'm playing wether and waves it'll only drop by about sort 25 30% an hour other times it's closer to sort of 40% so yeah if you are going to be playing some genin some we and something like that on this thing you're probably going to not want to stray too far from the nearest plug socket of course sadly Samsung hasn't bothered to update the s25 when it comes to the charging speeds so you've still got the super fast 25 W charging it's actually just as super fast as a one-legged granny wearing a concrete girdle and of course you got the 15 wat wireless charging support as well and that is now che2 so s25 one of very few smartphones that actually supports that I have noticed that when I slap the Galaxy s25 just on my regular Chi charger sometimes it stops charging at around the sort of 70 to 80% Mark for absolutely bugger all reason that I can ascertain doesn't appear to have anything to do with any adaptive charging features because I've had a good fiddle about with those in the background so yeah as for the software side of things well it's Samsung's own one ui7 slapped on top of Android 15 this will immediately look familiar to any Samsung fans out there with a few key differences like the separation of the notifications panel and the control center you can switch that back to the original effort if you don't like it and of course Samsung once again doubling up on features that Android already provided so you got the smart things smart home control you got Samsung Pier which I just immediately fraking delete CU otherwise I end up constantly accidentally swiping it into view so it's the usual gripes on the flip side you do get a full s years of OS updates and guaranteed security patching as well which is one of the more generous offerings out there and frankly I don't know many people who would go as long as 7 years with the same smartphone but if you want to your bloody and of course that AI is fully integrated in here now as well there's buger all escaping it so you got like said the circle to search in Gemini Shenanigans which is in pretty much all Androids now all of the original Galaxy AI features from the s24 series are present and correct and in some cases slightly more updated and upgraded like the translation and transcription now supports more languages and of course you can also quickly get yourself a bit of a morning midday or evening brief which isn't exactly a game changer and mostly just lets you know if you're going to get absolutely bloody socked taking the kids to school or whatever you can also have this morning brief read out to you by Bigsby when your alarm goes off in the morning but believe me you really don't want that to happen cuz let me tell you Bigby is just far too chirpy at 6:00 a.m. especially when reading out some of the latest news headlines hello it's currently 9:02 a.m. here's the latest news from Google teenager appears in court charg with school murder wait what family of dad shot dead outside Jim question why this happened liver Echo I just absolutely pray that Bigsby doesn't replace my doctor at any point good news Mr spurt you've got cancer of the scrotum anyway yes lots of the a shenanigans packed on here but I've covered pretty much all of that in my in-depth Galaxy s25 tips and tricks guide so go check out that video if you want a closer look at all of that I don't want to bang on about it yet again oh and also one other we gripe I've got with the s25 is that Samsung hasn't bothered to upgrade the storage in this thing so once again the base model comes with just 128 gigs of the stuff not expandable as usual which for a flagship smartphone in 2025 I mean there are several words for it and all of them I'd probably have to censor out so we'll just leave it at that and also there's still no Ultra widebands Tech crammed into this thing so if you own a Tesla and you want to unlock it with your smartphone well tough bollocks really just use a key like a normal person or upgrade to the Plus in the ultra cuz they've got it now the camera Tech also hasn't been upgraded at all for this generation the galaxy s25 has a 50 meg main sensor backed by a 12m Ultra wide angle shooter and a 10m telephoto jobby which takes over when you hit the three time zoom level now the camera app again will be familiar to Samsung fans beyond the fact that most of the Wii toggles have now been crammed here at the bottom which is good makes it easy easier to use onehanded you got all the standard stuff like portrait mode food mode night mode which is automatically activated in auto mode anyway and then the full-on dedicated Pro mode definitely well worth bouncing into if you do want to get a very precise kind of shot fiddle around with the saturation levels Etc but for my test and I did what most people will do just stuck to the default photo modes and Samsung scene Optimizer was switched off although there's still plenty of processing on display here sometimes sharpening but mostly deep saturation to try and brighten up the visuals I did still notice a lot of noise and overall lack of fine detail in my more ambient snaps or also when the s25 had some strong contrast to deal with you certainly get a lot more Grain on here than you do with many other Android flagships and likewise the Galaxy s25 hasn't proven itself a reliable shooter for kids pets and basically anything that isn't completely inanimate either in the regular or the portrait mode which again quite heavy process in there there any movement will usually mean quite blurry results and a picture that's only good for one thing hying straight in the bin the telephoto shooter is Handy for getting closer to your subject and it can spaff out some goodlooking snaps when the focus behaves itself but again my photos were sometimes a bit noisy or soft if the lighting wasn't ideal and also don't punch in Beyond around the 15 time zoom level because things get rather fuzzy after that and that Ultra wide angle shooter seems to be fine but again similar story to the other sensors you'll get plenty of noise if the lighting isn't great now Samsung has of course improved its AI editing tools including some slightly more reliable human obliteration and that new best shot gobbin as well as the ability to create your own filters using any photo out there but again I covered all of that lovely stuff in my Galaxy s25 tips and tricks guys again go check out that video for all you need to know as for the video you can once again shoot up to AK footage BL mostly stuck to 4K shot at 60 frames per second and there's benefits from sh visuals as well as Samsung's excellent stabilization that smooth Zoom is one of my favorite additions helped by the near seamless transition between the different lenses however at nighttime the s25 does again struggle with grain and the visual quality dips rather rapidly again it's the camera Pros who are cated for here cuz you now got a bit of log support so you can do a good bit of color correction in anded get your video looking exactly how you want it and Samsung has also bunged on an audio eraser tool which I've not been too impressed with so far it certainly can't do much with lots of background Gusty wind action it basically just morphs it into some sort of nasty electronic Distortion instead while it also has minimal impact on any crowd Guff video and you got yourself a 12 megapixel front face and selfie shooter here on the Galaxy s25 which again can capture up to 4K Ultra HD video at 60 frames per second but again those visuals do get rather grainy and soft when the lighting isn't fantastic so I definitely stick to daytime shooting if I were you and there you have it my Lely that and a tasty wi nutshell it's Samsung's fresh new Galaxy s25 flagship phone and yes very little has actually been upgraded in terms of the hardware Etc versus last year's s24 but for me the fact that you've got the Snapdragon a to in there is a massive boost to the performance and the battery life certainly versus the old exus model so I'm certainly enjoying the s25 a lot more than I was enjoying the s24 of course it is a shame that Samsung hasn't upgraded the s25 in other ways the measly amount of storage and the fact that the camera Tech is really lagging behind some of the other flagships out there bit of a bum really but you know if you are after a compa packed fresh new smartphone in 2025 well the s25 is going to be one of your few options the xiaomi 15 hopefully lingering just on the horizon anyway that's what I reckon it would be great to hear your thoughts on the Galaxy s25 down in the comments below please do po subscribe and ding that

while Google's pixel 9 a just lingering on the horizon there and into this mid-range melee swaggers the fresh new Galaxy a56 Samsung's later stab a smartphone flexing its metaphorical Peck and yelling stuff like come on then you a bunch of jizz swillers have it sorry I'm about five espressos deep and just feeling really pumped my brain kind of itches now the Galaxy a56 is quite a bit more expensive than last year's a55 and while some of the specs have been boosted including a fresh chipset and a faster charging battery Samsung Galaxy a56 has also been downgraded in one area so just under a week ago I thrust my sim into this sizable smartphone to test out the camera Tech battery life performance all that Shenanigans this is my full in-depth Galaxy a56 review and for more on the latest and greatest Tech please do po subscribe and H that notifications Bell cheers now while Samsung hasn't made any massive changes for the Galaxy a56 as far as design goes a few subtle tweaks here and there for one it's now a wee bit Slimmer than the previous generation it's 7.4 Ms while those bezels are also now a we bit skinnier so the display has filled out to 6.7 in although there is still obvious room for improvement especially down below the display where you've got a slight sort of mini Jimmy Hill chin yeah the a56 certainly a big old bugger as usual got a proper good heft to it as well and you got those typical iPhones flat edges with a bit of a bump for the volume rocker and the power button there on the right Edge it would certainly be more comfortable to clutch if it was a bit more rounded on the back end but at least you've got curved Corners so it's not horrific to clutch it doesn't feel like holding hands with Freddy Krueger or anything but I can't wait for this particular fad to be over and for a bit more roundness curviness to come back into play but you know the a56 looks and feels like a premium device you got that good old heft of course you got the metallic frame all the key factors you've got a bit of gorilla glass victus plus front and back end on the a56 so far touch word no little scratches on Nicks whatsoever on that screen I do always get a wee bit nervous with Samsung smartphones cuz they don't slap a pre-installed screen protector on their blowers but I would still absolutely suggest doing so your own accord because yeah they do tend to pick up we scratches and scars over time if you want your blow to keep on looking pristine it's worthy small investment and I so far same story for the back end as well no Battle Scars just yet but as you can see another shiny rear here on the a56 that does tend to get quite grubby over time even if the dark finish does mask quite a lot of the filth and scum I'd certainly like to see Samsung Slappy matte finish on its mid-rangers for a change but as it is you just have to give it the occasional buffing up keep it from looking too filthy now besides that glossy ass the only real difference in design between the Galaxy a56 and most other Sami blowers is this fresh new linear camera layout and by the way that Samsung's official name for it I can't take the credit for that one rather than the usual separate camera Islands unfortunately there is a proper dust trench right at the base of this camera sausage so you would want to give it the occasional brushing out or something if you don't want it to get all gunky and there's no real change to the jiggle action when the Galaxy a56 is lying flat on its back you got a choice of four colors as usual with the Galaxy a56 awesome graphite awesome light gray awesome pink and Olive of the awesome variety of course now personally I would have preferred the olive effort which isn't quite as awesome as Samsung's wris a in the self- congratulatory NE and Convention suggests but it's still got a bit more going on compared with this darker effort hopefully we'll get some fresher Bolder colors launched further down the line on the Galaxy a56 is also for the IP67 water and dust resistant as usual and while you don't get an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor unlike the s25 lot you do have a pretty decent Optical fingerprint sensor as you can see there not the fastest around by any means but it rarely feels only if your fingers are particularly grubby sticky or whatever no questions asked now absolutely zero prizes for guessing that on the software side it's Samsung's own oneui 7 launcher slathered there on top of bit of Android 15 and while Samsung isn't quite as dedicated on the software support front with the galaxy a56 compared with its S Series flagships it's really not far off at all you still get six full years of OS update and security patches so outside of like the pixel 9 a when that emerges this will be one of the best mid-rangers as far as that support is concerned and one UI bit hit and miss I got to say certainly I could Wibble on as usual about all the bits of one UI that really irk me from the needless duplication of apps and services to the increasing amount of crapware found on these things but honestly I feel like I've trotten down that particularly well-worn path so many times now that it no longer resembles a path it's actually a pretty deep trench littered with the broken remnants of countless empty whiskey balls I'm working on an in-depth a56 tips and tricks guide for a Clos look at all the software Shenanigans but of course Samsung has stuffed all the obligatory AI stuff on here including a good bit of circle to search usually works pretty Ruddy well got a good bit of Gemini of course as usual and Samsung is still persevering with Bigsby continues to have all the wit and intelligence of a bit of M25 roadkill however some AI bits are missing here on the a56 so for instance if you dive into the AI tools in the browser you'll see there's no web summarization effort in there which is a shame cuz that is pretty good although it was always limited to Samsung's own browser whereas I prefer Chrome anyway and you'll also spy if you drag out the old Edge toolbar that there's no morning afternoon or evening brief action on here which was of course one of the big new AI features that debuted on the s25 lot personally not too bothered to see it not stuffed on here cuz I found it about as useful as a first aid kit filled with harabor and porn mags I mean you'll bleed out but I guess at least you'll die happy but you do have the likes of AI select which can come in quite handy if for instance you find a picture you quite like you want to make it your desktop wallpaper you can do so with just a couple quick pores nice and simple and quite a lot of the other features I don't think most people would actually bother using ever like the transcription for instance which is still a bit wank it makes me sound even more like I've taken a few too many Hammer blows to the Head the rest of the one you experience pretty standard stuff it's good to see a good bit of eim action here on the e56 which is particularly handy if you do a lot of traveling just want to slap a temporary local Sim on there and fantastic news on the storage front cuz here in blighter you got 256 gigs of the stuff as standard here on the a56 which is double what you get in the Basse s25 and it certainly is increasingly common in the mid-range market for phones to come with 256 gigs minimum which is great to see especially when whopping great heers like genjin impact or like 30 gigs by themselves although sadly it's not all good news because for this generation Samsung has scrapped the micro SD memory card support you can only slap a couple of Sims in there now it's very sad to see Samsung gradually stripping away these features first the headphone jack went now the micro SD memory card support boo HS Etc not really much to report as far as the display text concerns here on the Galaxy a56 that screen is slightly enlarged to 6.7 in still a full HD Plus panel reasonably crisp visuals and on the default Vivid mode certainly quite Punchy poppy images as well got full hdr10 streaming support in services such as Netflix the contrast gorgeous as always it's not quite as bright as some Rivals hits around 12200 nits in high brightness mode but a slight boost over the previous generation and works fine in quite sunny conditions which I was actually able to test out this weekend was actually Sunny Outdoors so I sat out there watched a bit of funy streamed some anime no issues at all wasn't squinting away and this thing maxes out at 120 HZ refresher though it doesn't dial all the way down to 1 HZ it's not ltp Tech and likewise you don't have the same pwm demon smarts as some mid-range Rivals so if you are sensitive to alled flicker you'll want to look elsewhere as for that stereo speaker setup well it's pretty decent here on the Galaxy if 56 so xiaomi wins the mwc 2025 award for most likely to give Tech like myself a full-on stroke by launching about two dozen new things all at once so pretty loud when you peek out that volume decent balance between the top and bottom speaker as well a reasonable bit of Base in all of that course I still wouldn't use it to listen to music absolutely slap some Bluetooth headphones on or whatever for the L Shenanigans but the good news is Bluetooth streaming absolutely zero Wars with that whatsoever this past week and likewise no complaints with the connectivity I found that I've had a decent reception surprisingly good actually in this general area cuz there are quite a few sort of black holes shall we say as far as connectivity is concerned and the brains of the operation here on the Galaxy a56 is Samsung's fresh new 4 nanometer exus 1580 backed by 8 gigs of RAM I got to say the everyday experience here on the Galaxy a56 can be a we bit sticky at times you'll see the occasional judder when you're flicking between the different menus when you're swapping apps Etc some of the blame for that has to lie at one ui's door as well as the chipset itself you'll especially see a bit of slowness when you're using the camera app and if you are shooting two or three photos in quick succession you'll often see a notification pop up refining photo for anything up to about 11 or 12 seconds as for gaming well that's also not quite as smooth here on the Galaxy a56 versus some of the competition like nothing's phone 3A at least if you have a go on WEA and waves and more intensive demand and fair on the default mediumish Graphics the Galaxy a56 still occasionally stumbled and struggled to maintain a consistent frame rate and if you want a proper bit of eye candy slip it into the higher visual settings well you'll regularly see the a56 huffing and puffing it's kind of like forcing James cordin to run a double Marathon while wearing a concrete rain coat which coincidentally is something I'm actively seeking to fund on Kickstarter but in better news the Galaxy a56 does at least stay cool even if you're gaming for hours at a time helped Along by the slightly larger Vapor chamber that Samsung's crammed inside compared with the previous generation and also Samsung's gaming mode isn't quite as cak as it used to be it's now easier to access and it's got a handful of decent features in there allowing you to lock the screen brightness block notifications Etc in better news the battery life is pretty bloody good here on the Galaxy a56 once again got a 5,000 milliamp capacity cell stuff's inside of that rather sizable frame and this can actually keep you going for two full days between charges if you're fairly chill not too much camera or gaming action but about 5 hours of screen on time a day plenty of messaging web browsing and plenty of audio streaming in the background too and if you're a much more demanding user your phone is practically glued to your Palm while no worries with around 8 to 9 hours of screen on time including a fair bit of camera play bit of video chatting bit of gaming here and there I still found that I managed to get through a full intensive day with around s 15 to 20% battery life remaining at the end I tried pretty much everything I could think of including a good bit of mobile Hotpot in on this thing in my travels and seriously I could not kill it before I was all tucked up with Teddy at night and while Samsung didn't Tinker with the battery capacity they did at least mercifully boost the recharging on this things you now got 45 W wide charging which means you'll get a full charge from drained in roughly 70 minutes so I still wouldn't call it fast exactly but at least it's not so tediously slow and it makes you want to ram your face into aing waffle maker so hey let's finish up this delightful wi Galaxy a56 review by puran into the very so of that camera Tech and the specs certainly sound very familiar compared with last year's Galaxy a55 you've got a 50 meg primary shooter with Optical image stabilization backed by a 12 megapixel Ultra wide angle shooter and the obligatory 5 megapixel macro Snapper too now Samsung's made a few tweaks and improvements for its camera app in 2025 so for instance you can quickly access your main toggles and modes down here at the bottom including boost into two high rare's 50 megapixel mode and turning on the old motion photo of course all the usual camera modes including the obligatory fun mode it's just so fun I might have to go blow my own brains out cuz I can't imagine life getting any better than this and of course the usual fan favorites including single take and a good bit of pro action as well but this past week I just stuck with the regular Pho mode like most folk will do and I found my test shots with the a56 came out pretty well on the hall those picks are packed with fine detail on the default 12 Meg mode as long as you got enough light while this mid-ranger can also C pretty well with HDR type situations ah you will get the usual Samsung brighten and color boost Shenanigans but not too many of my photos were obviously oversaturated and most people seem to like the effect regardless it was only really the occasional Focus feel that let the a56 down this did happen more than expected Samsung says that it's worked on improving portrait shots with enhanced skin tones Sky grass Etc other I struggled to see the difference between this and earlier models and as usual any motion is likely to give you a blurry pick so you'll have to time your shots well although the edge detection is generally decent and somewhat counterintuitively I actually saw a lot less noise in low light and high contrast situations with the a56 versus the s25 lot my night slaps looked impressively bright and not really very grainy as for the macro shooter well as always that's just a bit CAC really and the ultra wide shooter in brilliant either certainly stumbles when the lighting conditions are less than perfect as for shoot and video well you can capture 4K footage at 30 frames per seconds no 60 FPS option there you will have to drop the resolution to full HD you want to boost it to 60 FPS and I found the Galaxy a56 attempts at video capture weren't too bad at all again you'll see some saturation when the sun is shining and the focus occasionally took a we bit longer than expected to lock onto a subject but the stabilization pretty decent video quality is reasonably sharp at 4K and I had no problems with the audio either although I didn't get the chance to test the a56 in Gusty conditions because the weather here has been surprisingly un sucky and then finally for the camera Tech around front you've got yourself your basic bog Standard 12 megapixel selfie shooter with the ability to pull back a bit for those group shots and the Samsung Galaxy a56 can sh up to 4K resolution footage at 30 frames per second or 60 FPS option using that front facing camera it's not quite as good as some Rivals but absolutely fine for your video charts as you can hear mic picking up absolutely fine the stability is good and the overall visuals absolutely fine and of course you got the usual obligatory AI for editing tools slapped on here as well although this has been a wee bit bulky for me here on the a56 so for instance as you can see there if I try and get the object razor on the go basically just says no it not today as I say that's that's most likely just down to this being an early model it's not quite on release just yet so hopefully that will all be sorted by the time it hits shelves and that right there my lovies and a TIY we nutshell is my full Frank final Samsung Galaxy a56 review you know no real shocks or surprises it's a perfectly Dependable mid-range mobile performance not quite as good as some Rivals but the battery life has been excellent camera Tech's been pretty decent of course how well you get on with one UI will depend on your history with Samsung whether you bot use its own apps and services personally I got to say I'd rather go nothing phone 3A which is considerably cheaper than this bad boy as well it's got a bit more personality bit more going on and the performance overall was a bit better as well and of course plenty more capable mid-rangers like the pixel 9A lingering just on the horizon that's why I reckon anyway it be great to your thoughts on the Galaxy a56 down in the comment bit down below please do

Samsung's Galaxy s25 this is one of the very last mini Androids you can bag yourself in 2025 so using it these last few days has been kind of a bitter sweet experience just like stealing sweets from a small child when his parents aren't luing and then tripping him up and running off down the street cackling like a Randy Bishop it cost you €999 or about 900 gbps you got some decent little pre-order bonuses as well if you go check out xiaomi's website anyway here's my full in-depth xiaomi 15 review and for more on the latest and greatest Tech please do po subscribe and dig that notifications Bell cheers so first up for any fans of last year's xiaomi 14 blower the xiaomi 15 Sports rather familiar design as usual it is quite a chuner but it's still feels great in the hand as it's a pleasantly compact 6.36 in and you got the pleasingly curvy Corners as well which again helps with the old hand feel even if xiaomi has gone with quite flat iPhone style edges and unlike the xiaomi 15 Ultra or pretty much any other Flagship these days the xiaomi 15 actually weighs under 200 g so it's not a smartphone and a workout in one you got a completely flat display as well bugger all curvature at the edges there and respectably skinny bezels surrounding that screen as well so it's basically just like a slightly bigger Samsung Galaxy s25 to be honest you've got xiaomi's very own shield glass protect on the front and back ends rather than Gorilla Glass which a lot of phones go for apparently the shield glass is highly shatter resistant I Haven actually fumbled and dropped this thing despite the number of arras I put away in Barcelona the last few days you do also have a pre-installed screen protector on there unlike the Galaxy s25 which is a massive relief especially spunks out of bloody Grand on a new blower the aluminium frames what's a smooth matte finish so it doesn't get all grubby or anything and you've got a smooth glass back as well so the XI 15 not exactly very grippy so it's a bloody good job this thing is quite dinky really so you can clutch it proper tight especially if you're using it one-handed you got a variety of colors for the XI 15 including black white liquid silver and oh yes that green is back baby now this is a very subtle shade as you can see there just a hint of green really and sure I'd personally prefer a bolder design but I do like this pale Hue as well I especially appreciate how it continues round to that aluminium edine and you got a full-on bit of ip68 water and dust resistance now in that display you've now got a built-in ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which can accurately map your digit using 3D mapping type clever AR Shenanigans and this has stumbled a couple of times for me when my hands have been particularly wet but usually it works absolutely fine even when you're about here 60% moist and as you'd expect good bit of Face Unlock action in backup as well which as you can see there pretty nippy even if the liting conditions less than ideal as for the software well of course it is naturally xia's own hypos version 2.0.10 1.0 and this is basically the quality Street of the Android Launcher world you got some great stuff in that tin some other stuff that can just get right in the Fring bin you got some tasty green triangle type efforts like the feature packed gaming modes and the extensive customization but then unfortunately mixed in you will find some dry ass coconut monstrosities which need dumping right in the North Sea like some rather unintuitive UI design and the endless crapware and as usual I've experienced a few wi bugs the occasional we bit of jun in hypos these last few days so occasionally for instance a notification will pop up on screen and I'll tap it and it'll just completely ignore me it'll blank me like it's a member of my own family and also if I'm using an app with a light colored background and I drag down the old notifications well I can't actually bloody see what any of it is it just kind of Blends in there for some weird reason so I that's generally about as helpful as a kick in the and naturally you do get a few AI bits chucked in here as well although it's generally quite tucked away not as heavily marketed as some manufacturers like to do got the usual transcription and translation Shenanigans a subtitles is pretty good that can basically pop up subtitles on the screen for anything that includes vocals and speech basically and this works either with the system audio or just using the xiaomi 15's built-in mics you also cre yourself a good bit of eim support and as for the storage well it's 256 gigs or 512 if you're fancy a bit more and the shiai 15 Sports an almost compact 6.36 in AMOLED display it's quite dinky compared with a lot of modern mobiles but it's still perfectly comfortable for enjoying a couple of hours of random anime when you're stuck at an airport or whatever got a 1200p resolution that's 460 pixels per inch so the visuals aren't quite as crispy as that Ultra model despite the shrinking in size but that's really bugger all difference the screen is just as sharp as you need it to be go for HDR 10 plus and Dolby Vision streaming support and it's a proper bright panel as well I certainly didn't have to do any squinting to see what was going on even when I was out in Barcelona ler the refresh rate scals from 1 to 120 HZ and you got full-on DC demon for easier on the eye experiences in low light that screen apparently certified flicker free by TUV reinland who seemed perfectly happy to dish out loads of medals to companies these days presumably in return for buckets of cash but my favorite thing about the xiaomi 15's display is the fact that it's still surprisingly responsive even when it's absolutely soing wet I was using it in the shower swapping between different apps playing different tracks on Spotify stuff like that absolutely worked fine despite the fact it was incredibly moist sorry I get the feeling i' said moist quite a lot in this video for some reason yes particularly handy if you have to live somewhere that's a wee bit damp like the UK you've also got a respectable pair of stereo speakers your full Dolby Atmos support as well as highres audio wired and wireless and absolutely bugger all problems with the Bluetooth streaming as well even at mwz where I was literally surrounded by hundreds of people all using Bluetooth devices there was no signal interference or anything and probably no gasps of shock or amazement when it comes to the brains of the operation here either naturally it's Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite running the show as back by a very healthy 16 gigs of that Ram stuff unfortunately hyper OS can be surprisingly Judy at times on the xiaomi 15 but that is absolutely down to the launcher General bulkiness rather than the actual Elite but of course when it comes to gaming on the xami 15 zero Wars there whatsoever the likes of we and waves another popular titles where you run around as an anime girl and an incredibly unnaturally short skirt popping beasties right in their skilly mugs all runs absolutely perfectly 60 frames per second barely drops a frame anywhere along the way even when things get proper Ruddy mental of course this one does get rather warm after about sort 20 to 30 minutes of non-stop gameing action desp despite the dedicated cooling system that xiaomi has crammed into that compact frame but this heat buildup doesn't seem to bother the 15 at all solders on maintaining that excellent frame rate throughout yes you do have a dedicated gaming mode of course as usual packed to the pits with all kinds of great little tools and features and for such a mini handset as well shami's done a good job with the Battery tech you got to 5,240 milliamp capacity sell I believe it is so that's actually not too far off the xiaomi 50 Ultra and it's actually bigger than the battery you'll find stuffed inside of other Mega giant fraking godzilla smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy s25 Ultra and the pixel9 pro XL my longest day using the xiaomi 15 as my full-time phone began at about 6 a.m. lasted all the way up until just God midnight basically and it involved an awful lot of Spotify streaming in the background plenty of camera action of course testing out the Optics loads and loads of screen on time I did find that Spotify dream it a bit faster than I was expecting but despite that I still almost made it to bed before this thing keeled over and needed pluging in no worries though if you do need to quickly Juice It Up at any given moment cuz you got 90 wat pyper charge or whatever they call it wired charging so literally bug a cable in it for like 10 minutes It'll fly up that battery counter you also got a bit of 50 W Wireless hypercharge action too all right kitties how about we conclude this xiaomi 15 review as always is with a good hod squint at the Optics and what you got slapped on this back end is a fresh like a branded quad cam setup now that main camera uses xiaomi's own custom 50 meg light Fusion 900 sensor rather than the lyt 900 sensor stuffed into the ultra and while yeah this light Fusion sensor ain't quite as stupidly massive as the lyt 900 I was still rather chuffed with the shots spaffed out by the xiaomi 15 at nighttime and in more challenging light you have to squint pretty hard to find any kind of noise in there unlike the Galaxy s25 night pick while colors still ster reasonably true even with rather soft ambient lighting depending on which like a filter you use that is because as always you've got a choice of two you've got like a authentic otherwise like a vibrant now I really like the authentic modes even though the default is the vibrant alternative which certainly makes for eye pleasing results especially if you're shooting against a bright blue sky like people in the UK won't be and as usual xiaomi Nails it when it comes to HDR shots rather than turning everything artificially bright and saturating the image the 15 tries to realistically capture any high contrast scenes complete with atmospheric Shadows it's all nice and Moody and I love it and it's understandable that plenty of people will prefer the apple samsy way of doing things but if you want a more Moody Vibe the xiaomi 15 is an absolute Banger now the Uber posh dual Zoom setup of the xiaomi 15 Ultra has been replaced here in the xiaomi 15 with a single floting telephoto shooter using a 50 meg Samsung gn5 sensor it's a 60 mil equivalent and as you can see there this kicks in at around the 2.6 time zoom level and this is still decent enough in the evenings although of course detail levels do drop compared with the ultra and some other Flagship Rivals once you properly start to crop in there still more than does the job for portrait snaps however helped Along by The General smart arery of the master portrait mode complete with a bit of adjustable bck here which can be tweaked after you've actually taken the shot to strengthen it or just pair it down a bit unfortunately you will still see a lot of blur if the lighting isn't quite perfect and your subject is in motion so you'll basically want to take loads of shots just to make sure you get a good one and last up is a 50 meg Samsung JN one Ultra wide shooter with 14 mil equivalent focus and this is certainly one of the better ra wides on any smartphone that I've tested there's no real compromise to the tones while detail levels stay nice and strong as well and as usual of course xiaomi hasn't neglected the video capture the xiaomi 15 can capture up to 8K resolution footage if you want to really fill up that storage super fast otherwise you can dial it back down to 4K resolution you can capture that at 2430 or 60 frames per second or 120 capture sadly you've also got the Master Cinema mode on standby and switching this on takes the ultrawide shooter out of play you also have to top off the 4K at 30 FPS but it does make up for it with Crispy 10bit capture that's best used when shooting those strong contrast scenes colors are again quite bold as with the like of vibrant mode but any kind of saturation is pretty rare and you can still punch in with the zoom when needed although I did miss Samsung's smooth Zoom feature when doing so of course though like videography is a bit hit and miss can be quite patchy at times with some very soft grainy visuals about dodgy focus and every now and then but xia's quad mic setup cleanly picks up audio from all areas so overall pretty decent and then finally around front you got yourself a 32 Meg selfie Cam and you can use this to capture 4K HDR video at 30 frames per second otherwise again 60 FPS if you knock that HDR off and I've had absolutely no issues with video chatting with this thing it' be perfectly fine for your vlogging Shenanigans especially as the stability is really good yeah that mic pickup excellent and I basically like every smartphone out there now even those Ruddy iPhones finally you've got some AI based photo editing Shenanigans including the ability to erase anyone who gets in the way of your beautiful snap this is mostly automatic these days very little effort whatsoever so you just be like yeah let's just get rid of this guy this guy basically everyone they can all just piss off and then about 15 20 seconds later off they pop and I think my Lov these that just about sums it up that's my full final Frank xiaomi 15 review and you know naturally inclined to like it because it is quite a dinky handset compared with the absolute Titans that you know constitutes a flagship in 2025 there so bloody Big King Kong could use them as a butt plug but of course no real compromises to the performance you know occasional little little bit of Jun from hyper oest but certainly the actual you Elite that can handle whatever you Chuck at it gaming Etc buty life perfectly respectable for more dinky handset you got the gorgeous display and everything and some pretty top-notch camera Tech as well the only thing really missing from this versus the ultra is these super Posh zomi Shenanigans which frankly most people I don't think will really miss this thing can still take some pretty damn snazzy portraits so overall you know again as I say besides the little bit of hypos jankiness here and there really enjoyed my time with the xami 15 I happily keep my sim slapped inside there that's why I reckon anyway would be great to your thoughts on the Shamy 15 the Shamy 15 Ultra just life in general really just tell me how you're feeling down in the comments below sorry I've been drinking far too much coffee and I'm just absolutely jabbering on yes please do po

cpeGZEpsUxorgPZow7Z3ari-ZpQ,UNDERCOVER RV Tech reviews Brinkley &amp; Jayco travel trailer RVs,Is the more expensive RV really better? In today's video I'll be reviewing a 2024 Brinkley Model Z Air 285 and a 2024 Jayco Eagle ...,Rigor RV Repair,2024-10-05T11:00:13Z,"{'default': {'url':

often try to show you the more expensive RVs saying that they are better quality but are they I'm an RV technician and I went undercover at RV dealership so I could look at these RVs and tell you which ones are quality and which ones are height in today's video I'm going to be comparing two pretty large travel trailers a 2024 Brinkley Model Z air 285 and a jco eagle 294 CK BS the interesting thing is that the jco eagle is actually 5 ft longer than the Brinkley but the Brinkley is like $30,000 more expensive in this video we're going to answer the question is the Brinkley worth that extra $30,000 for a smaller floor plan and if you stick around to the end of the video I'm going to talk about the four things you need to do to be sure that you get a Quality RV so the first category we're going to look at is the water heaters now both of these RVs have a tankless furion brand water heater older tankless fur on water heaters had a sensor problem that if rain water was blown into the exhaust tube it would fill up and disable a sensor so the water heater would quit working supposedly the newer generation furion tankless water heaters have solved this problem so these I give 10 out of 10 points keep in mind if you're wanting to Boondock in these travel trailers a tankless water heater is not the best choice because you cannot conserve water the next category we're going to look at is the roofs on these RVs and both of these have a comparable quality membrane type roof which I would give 10 out of 10 points keep in mind with all membrane type roofs if they're not glued down correctly at the factory wind coming over the top of the RV can make bubbles grow and completely rip the roof off I have a free checklist called my don't buy a lemon guide that covers this and other types of defects that you should be watching for one thing I want to note that Brinkley did really well on their roof is the quantity of lap sealant they put around all of the fixtures the trailers I've seen that have had imperfections in the caulking that resulted in leaks was where they put the caulking on too thin and it tore as they were going down the road so this nice thick layer of caulking is going to last longer before it cracks the next category we're going to talk about on these RVs is the refrigerators both of these RVs have a pretty comparable 12volt refrigerator the Brinkley has a furion brand which I've also seen with the Gerard name brand on it and the jco eagle has a GE 12vt refrigerator that also is labeled everchill or Canon or all kinds of different names they slap on the same refrigerator cuz GE does not make this refrigerator I am not really a fan of 12volt refrigerators in particular these because I've seen a lot of issues with the computer boards going bad on them and some models of these refrigerators you can't even get replacement parts for if it's outside of warranty you're paying for a new refrigerator which is super frustrating I give six out of 10 points for both of these refrigerators the next category in my grading scale is the air conditioners jco eagle has a standard Coleman air conditioner I've had to replace a lot of these because they lost their refrigerant the Brinkley has a furion chill Cube air conditioner the chill Cube actually has some additional features that make it really desirable first off it's 18,000 BTU rating rather than maximum of 15,000 BTUs from Coleman BTU is this British thermal units it's just a measurement of how much heat it can move from the inside of your RV to the outside these air conditioners can not only move heat faster so they will cool the RV more effectively but also the chill Cube has a different type of compressor on the inside it's variable speed it uses way less electricity up to 40% less energy usage the other big benefit is essentially it has a soft start built in so if you're running your RV on a generator and the AC cranks up it doesn't create a huge surge of power draw I definitely give the furion chill cube a 10 out of 10 next let's look at the cabinet quality on these two RVs and interestingly despite the huge price increase on the brinkly the quality of the cabinet frames and doors appears to be the same the doors are made out of a solid wood material and the cabinet face frames are made out of lumber core with a vinyl wrap on it unfortunately very few RV manufacturers use solidwood face frames on their cabinets the consequence is that if water gets on these face frames and around the edge of the vinyl wrap it can cause it to swell well and burst the vinyl wrap Brinkley is doing something interesting on their drawer boxes a dovetail joint on the front of the box to prevent the box from coming apart if the drawer is slammed because of the material choices in their cabinets I give both the Brinkley and the jco eight out of 10 points next let's talk about the countertop quality in these two RVs Brinkley chose to use solid surface countertops in the jco eagle I see thermofoil countertops if you accidentally set a hot pan on the thermofoil it will burn it or melt completely through it one of my viewers said they set a can of carpet cleaner on the countertop and the chemicals ran down and melted a hole through the countertop thermofoil if very well cared for can last you a long time but it is not an any way comparable to Solid Surfaces in terms of its objective quality and durability here's another concern on the jco in particular at the edge of the sink there's a gap in the caulking where water is going to get in there and get behind the thermop foil wrap and start to swell up the MDF that's going to ruin the countertops if they don't fix this Factory defect I give the countertops in the jco eagle two out of 10 points but Brinkley gets 10 out of 10 points folks if you want to know how to tell the difference between thermofoil and solid surface counters or how to tell the quality of an RV in general you should check out my RV shopping course if you get my shopping course then you also get access to the app which you see me using today to grade these RVs and a database of over 500 RVs grades that I have put in and other undercover Shoppers the cool thing about the RV database is that you can actually just sort by letter grade and quickly see what gets a a b or c grade let's take a look at the choice of slideout components on these two RVs both the Brinkley and the jco eagle utilize what I consider to be the most reliable slide out mechanism which is the through frame electric slide out but the jco eagle has an additional slide out with a different type of mechanism this one is is cable driven now there's been some confusion with some of my viewers I give any RV that has the B ACU slide cable system an automatic F because it is a terrible system that can break the wall of your RV this one also from B their exact slid cable system is actually different in how it's constructed it actually solves all of my complaints against the Bal acus slide system it doesn't have the ability to rip cables brackets Off the Wall the way the ACU slide does or drip oil on the roof because of that the Bal exact slide on this I still give a 10 out of 10 points keep in mind with the exact Slide the cables will still get loose over time and they will need to be retension it requires more maintenance than the slides on the Brinkley next let's talk about the frame and suspension on these RVs one thing I found very interesting to note is that Brinkley chose to add shock absorbers to their suspension this is not a common RV feature when you hit a bump in the road if you don't have shock absorbers and people with really old cars and blown out shock absorbers might have experienced this the car will bounce up and down and up and down and up and down the purpose of shock absorbers is to stop that movement so that you have steering and braking on your wheels and they're not bouncing and skidding it also makes the ride more comfortable and smooth so for both keeping your stuff in place and safety reasons I think shock absorbers are a really really great feature to have next let's talk about the plumbing on these two RVs many RV manufacturers are putting Plumbing together in a way that causes leaks brinkly when first started making RVs was putting improper Plumbing into their RVs one thing I'm really happy to say is that Brinkley has listened to people asking for better plumbing and they've actually made changes they have quit putting in improper Plumbing connections and now use pre-made flex hose assemblies at their water pump I am very happy to give their Plumbing a 10 out of 10 and say this is quality the J on the other hand when I looked at the plumbing everything looked good under the sinks behind the toilet blah blah blah blah blah but hidden kind of access panel at the back of the water heater not only did they use the improper Flex tube pinch clamped onto a Pex fitting thing that causes leaks this is like the most likely scenario to create water leaks in RV where you're not going to see it until it's done a lot of damage I have to give the plumbing on this jco a zero out of 10 the only saving grace in all of this is that it's like this much bad Plumbing I have a suggestion for you if you're seriously looking to buy this RV call Jo and ask if you can special order one with good Plumbing they'll tell you no I've had other people do it but the reason I say that is they're not going to change this unless you ask for something to be different that's why Brinkley changed their Plumbing I think if enough people ask Jo for better Plumbing they'll change these two tubes to something correct the last category is fit and finish on the jco eagle I found a whole piece of trim missing off of the door to the bathroom found some other small trims that were out of place and then like I mentioned before the caulking around the sink that's going to leak can damage the countertops I give the jco fit and finish seven out of 10 points Brinkley on the other hand I'm happy to say had really excellent fit and finish I give the Brinkley fit and finish 10 out of 10 points the total aggregate score for the Jacob Eagle was 70 points which would have been a c minus trailer unfortunately because of the plumbing issue I give this an automatic f grade why would I give this an FG grade for a couple of bad plumbing fittings that are easy to fix look folks if these start dripping slowly and you don't know notice it because it's not gushing everywhere it's buried under an access panel where you're not going to see it leaking until it's caused a lot of water damage even just a couple of bad Plumbing connections are a very serious issue you should not have to replum a new RV Brinkley on the other hand scored 94 points solid a grade trailer so is the Brinkley worth the extra $30,000 for a smaller floor plan is it really that much better quality the thing you got to understand about RV shopping is there's really four different things things you need to do in order to get a Quality RV the first thing you have to do is make sure that the RV fits your desired camping lifestyle for example I wouldn't recommend either of these RVs if you're wanting to seriously Boondock this is why I've started offering Consulting for people shopping for RVs is there's a lot of things to consider about your desired usage relative to the RV the second thing is you need to take into account the quality of components and in this case yes the Brinkley is a more quality built RV that's what my shoing course and Grading app are really designed to dive into is all of those various components the third big thing you have to pay attention to though is manufacturing defects even something like a Brinkley that has selected quality components can have manufacturing defects these defects can ruin your camping experience if you don't catch them during the shopping process the fourth and final thing you have to pay attention to if you're buying a new RV is the reputation of the companies how they handle warranty claims is like a big difference in customer satisfaction so after watching this video leave a comment below and tell me what you think do you think the Brinkley is worth the extra money as far as my own answer to this question I'll just leave my letter grade stand where it is one gets an f and one is a a grade trailer if you're shopping RVs I've got a whole playlist of undercover RV reviews you can click here to see if you're interested in full- timing you can click here for my video about which RV is best for full timing if you want to understand the plumbing problem that's

series but is it a prime bit of pork loin or is it more of a Mankey old expired sausage roll or a little bit of poke scratch and you just found down the back of the sofa sorry I'll stop with a weird Pig analogy now but hey the Galaxy s25 plus isn't just bigger than the regular vanilla s25 it also bsts a few upgrades including a crisper screen more storage and a bigger battery What charges faster all of that and thankfully the plus model isn't quite as bowel quivering expensive as the Galaxy s25 Ultra although it will still drain your savings by roughly a grand unless you take advantage of Samsung's trading deals I've had my sim stuffed in it for a good few days now so here's my Galaxy s25 plus review and for more on the latest and greatest Tech please do poke subscribe and ding that notifications Bell cheers now first up I got to say personally I do prefer the more compact nature of the regular Galaxy s25 versus the plus but the plus doesn't feel outrageously huge it's standard smartphone size in 2025 you do have exceedingly skinny bezels surrounding that display so no excess bulk and the plus model is reasonably slender as well just a moth's man saac over 7 Ms and barely any extra girth added by the camera bumps as well which only just slightly out of that back endend although this doesn't prevent the inevitable jiggle action and of course it's the same old standard Samsung Galaxy smartphone design here so stick the s25 plus side by side with last's s24 plus it's kind of like comparing a cup of pretty M coffee with a mug of hot mud let's face it this design is so familiar now it's not likely to set many Hots a flatter despite the rather delightful Navy finish here and you can also grab this phone in Icy Blue Mint or Silver Shadow really like that mint model too and Samsung also has some online exclusive colors including some pretty bright Bal in your face efforts and pretty much the only design change that Samsung bothered with for the s25 plus was thickening up those camera lenses so now I got bigger bezels surrounding them which I don't really like to be honest and B warned the Galaxy s25 plus is quite a smooth slippery more for so not much grip there and of course no handy camera bump like most other mobiles to convenience rest your finger on just to help keep it stable if you are using the thing onehanded that we Grumble aside I haven't dropped the s25 plus once this week and of course your uncle likes a drink can be a little bit butter fingery at times you got yourself a bit of victus 2 Gorilla Glass front and back on the s25 plus so hopefully won't Splinter and crack if you do happen to Fumble this thing although I would have really liked to see a pre-installed screen protector on the s25 plus cuz my review models already got some pretty noticeable scratches after just a week of full-on use so you'll absolutely want to slap your own on here especially it's a Grand's worth of tech you don't want to co it in scratches in just a month or two you got the usual armor aluminium aluminium frame and a lovely matte finish for that back end as well so again resists grimy greasy nasty finger printy horribleness and fullon ip68 water and dust resistant as usual no surprises on the software front it's as always Samsung's very own oneui 7 slopped on top of Android 15 slopped quite an appropriate word cuz it is a little bit messy shall we say but with the rather generous promise of 7 years of OS updates and security patching it should see you through the Long Haul AI is of course the spine of one ui7 with the option of disabling any cloud-based processing all your data isn't spanked online without your permission I got to say the big shiny new AI features are a bit of a mixed bag to say the least so for instance you got now briefing which is mostly pants offering up little more than a glimpse of whether you're going to get absolutely shed on if you step Outdoors your upcoming calendar Shenanigans and a seemingly completely random Spotify playlist that's just packed full of random music unlike anything else you've ever listened to and as much as I love Jimmy eator I haven't listened to them since the last time I actually had more hair on my head than stashed in my W Front I mean the closest it's come to actually recommended me some metal music which is what I usually listen to is the other day when it suggested I slap on a bit of nickel back a which point I almost took a bloody tin opener to this thing I mean seriously in some areas that's still a hanging offense one of the most useful bits of the briefings is when sports scores automatically pop up on the lock screen and stuffed away in the status bar for your chosen team though any fellow mackam might want to disable that particular feature in fact Midway through that particular match Sunland versus all mercifully the now briefing stuff all vanished and stopped displaying the scores I couldn't tell if that was my s25 plus just being kind to me and did not end particularly well or whether that's just a bug sometimes it's hard to tell with one UI if something is a feature or just a bug you know some of the AI stuff's pretty decent so the smarter notification layout and everything very very good that all works wonderfully translation and transcription now support more languages though as usual can be a bit sketchy like for some reason my s25 seems to think that I'm Australian and it flat out refused to transcribe one of my voice recordings until I downloaded the English Australian language pack I swear to God I wasn't even that hammered and then I went anded out most of what I said anyway possibly because I'm not from the land of Punchy marsupial and toilet spiders and as always some of the best features like the web summarization tool are confined to Samsung's own apps and services you can't use them in the likes of Google Chrome but I do approve of some of the other one ui7 updates like for instance the ability to separate out the control center with the notifications panel and don't worry if you're not a fan cuz you can revert it back to the original setup by tapping into panel settings just one of many tips and tricks you'll find in my Galaxy s25 series tips and tricks guide go check that out and I also love the upgraded game boost toolbar which has finally been renovated so it's easy to access and a bit smarter than before even if some of the tools like the frame rate boost don't really seem to do much in any of the games I've tested them with and some of those stalwart Samsung Classics are still present and correct even if they haven't really been given much of a spit shine recently like good old decks yeah there's still far too much duplication going on in one UI 7 all a Samsung's own bits like Samsung p internet smart things etc etc just no I just want to get rid of all of it and just stick with the Google stuff now as for the Galaxy s25 Plus's Dynamic AMOLED 2X display well this is pretty much the same Tech as the previous generation it's a 6.7 inch here on the plus can sandwich neatly between the super compact Galaxy s25 and the mega enormous Ultra model it's more of a standard size these days it's a Quad HD Plus panel once again just like the old s24 plus you just need to remember to actually activate the maximum resolution within the display settings because it's not set to that by default course Samsung playback ve towards the more Vivid Poppy in yourf face type color reproduction you can absolutely Tinker with the vividness in the display settings you got nice sharp contrast full hdr10 streaming support in the likes of Netflix and the refresh rate maxes out at 120 HZ so on new i7 and supported app certainly feel pretty smooth if you boost the brightness all the way up it is practically I serin which is just as well cuz You' got no anti-reflective armor 2 glass slapped on here unlike the s25 ultra now visibility has been absolutely fine for me but then the s25 plus hasn't had to battle anything much more than a load of Gloom although I haven't said that Holy the sun is actually I think starting to break through the clouds a bit there this is the first time I've actually felt daylight in about 3 weeks I'm slightly concerned that I'm just going to spontaneously combust let me just go check this screen yeah no worries there even with a proper bit of sun glare absolutely fine the visibility however bear in mind if you are quite sensitive to alled flicker when you're you know Doom scrolling at 3:00 a.m. like the rest of us well you might want to stay clear because Samsung doesn't do much when it comes to pwm dimon or DC dimon there plenty of eye comfort features on there so at least you won't be full on migrain within minutes and of course it's a stereo speaker setup here on the Galaxy s25 plus and highly respectable Arrangement too nice and loud when you bump the volume up but the clarity doesn't take a hit vocals come through nice and crisp and reasonably Bassy not the bassiest of any blowers that I've tested recently but pretty good but what powers the plus well same as the rest of the s25 series you got qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite 4 Galaxy stuffed in there a slightly overclocked version of qualcomm's popular super henge chipset with the same 12 gigs of RAM action stuffed in here as before and this here is the most obvious upgrade versus the old s24 plus especially if you happen to be a game while the likes of genin impacts and WEA and waves occasionally stumbled on the old exus powered blower you'll enjoy beautifully smooth performance here on the Galaxy s25 plus and even if you're proper hooked on your anime girls in skimpy clothing running around smacking things really hard game of choice this skinny brick stays quite cool even after hours of gaming with assistance from the ever so slightly bigger Vapor chamber and no worries if you do want to install some whooping great Bugg like wether and waves and genjin impact because the Galaxy s25 plus starts at 256 gigs of storage mercifully unlike the regular s25 you can upgrade that to a full half a terabyte if you slip even more cash into Samsung's Slinky gusset oh and also unlike the regular Galaxy s25 the plus model serves up a tasty bit of ultra wideband Tech just like the ultra yum and the battery is almost as big here as in the ultra the 4,9 00 Mah capacity but it's still significantly smaller than a lot of recent Rivals emerging from China thanks to their silicon carbon Tech so I was slightly worried that the plus would start falling behind as far as battery life was concerned but I needn't have been worried at all cuz the battery life's been pretty bloody solid on this thing a regular day for me with my sim slapped Insider here generally involves around 6ish hours of screen on time including General mixed use lots of web browser messaging of course plenty of camera PL to test out the Optics video streaming and video chatting and plenty of audio streaming when the phone screen was hibernating as well on the likes of spotify and Audible and even with all of that I typically ended with around 35 to 40% battery life through a very long exhausting day so only if I did a proper bit of gaming or something on this thing that I would actually manage to get it into power saving mode by the time I was all tucked up with Teddy and yeah thankfully it does charge up faster than the regular Galaxy s25 you got 45 wat fast charging here still pretty measly compared with again a lot of the Chinese Rivals though which are top in the sort of 100 watt Mark and apparently there's been some reports from some areas of the Galaxy s25 plus not playing well with certain brands of USB cable Al thankfully I've had absolutely zero Gip from the one that Samsung chucked in the box with it I've also had no problems charging wirelessly you got ch2 15 W wireless charging support on this bad boy I've just been using my old pixel charger that's worked Absol absolutely fine so let's conclude this absolutely smold Galaxy s25 plus review with a squint at the camera Tech and I won't spent too long banging on about the Optics cuz it's the exact same camera setup as before the exact same setup as the s25 which I already did an in-depth review of so of course you got your 50 megap wide shooter you've got your 12 megapix Ultra wide shooter and then a single 10 megapixel telephoto lens with three times optical zoom I do like one little tweak that some has made Shifting the settings bar down to the bottom here so you can quickly and easily toggle the resolution you stick it in highres 50 meg mode change the aspect ratio switch on motion photos and access all of the various camera settings in here you'll spot a bit of intelligent optimization I left this on the default settings so maximum level but kept the scene Optimizer knocked off and I wasn't too shocked to see the exact same results spaffed out by the s25 plus compared with the smaller s25 even without Samsung's scene Optimizer the s25 still occasionally does that iphony thing of overexposing some shots blanching the tones to brighten them up a bit personally I do prefer a bit more texture some deeper shadows and speaking of which the s25 plus suffers the exact same issue as the rest of the s25 lineup where darker areas sometimes appear rather disturbingly noisy especially those night skies and portrait shots can also be a bit of a mixed bag with some intense separation and smoothing on short at times out of strong natural light faces can lack detail or look a little bit soft and those tones aren always quite right but thankfully daylight portrait shots seem to Fair a lot better lot more crispy detail tones looks a lot more natural occasionally works pretty well and of course you got the ultra wide angle shooter which doesn't bark the tones too badly and that telephoto Snapper works pretty well for getting you closer to your subject up to around the 10 times zoom level and then of course is diminishing returns after that got all the usual bonus bits chucked on here as well including the expert raw and the pro modes Samsung Staples like the food mode and that all single take which is pretty good for your family picks and of course you got the usual AI photo edit and shindig slapped on here as well so for instance the Galaxy s25 plus can quickly and easily remove any object or person that's lingering in your shot that you do not fancy leaving in there and this should us she works pretty damn well absolutely stunning stuff lik the best shot works pretty well if you've got a kid that is prawn to gning at the camera quite often and the Galaxy s25 plus does a pretty bang-up job for your video Shenanigans as well capturing up to 8K resolution footage as usual or 4K footage at 60 frames per second with HDR 10 switched on audio capture is pretty crisp and clear from all directions as long as things aren't too Gusty the stabilization is excellent it's only in low light where the Galaxy s25 plus really struggles churning out again grainy noisy horrible looking footage if you want to you can shoot a bit of log footage as well here on the Galaxy s25 plus then tweaking in post edit and you've also got an audio erasor tool kind of similar to what you get on the pixels but just not quite as good and using the 12 Meg selfie cam here on the Galaxy s25 plus you can once again shoot Ultra HD resolution footage at 60 frames per second with HDR smart enabled the visuals pretty good that's a bit of that sun again lovely stuff stabilization decent the audio pickup respectable as well but again in low light it kind of sucks and there you have it my Lely then it is T nutshell is Samsung's fresh new Galaxy s25 plus and of course if you got last year's s24 plus upgrading into this thing would be pretty much bloody pointless despite the fact the performan has had a severe kick up the crotch good bit of that Snapdragon action than that ex's Guff but all let's face it these phones nowadays they're just iterations of one another there's no need to upgrade year- on year especially with the ridiculously great software support that Samsung serves up of course as always really stiff competition for the Galaxy s25 plus from the likes of the OnePlus 13 which I absolutely Ruddy adore it's more affordable I prefer the oxygen OS experience and the camera Tech in general you've also of course got the pixel 9 pro and pixel9 pro X if you want another big in like the xiaomi 14t series as well soon to be superseded by the 15s stay tuned for bit more of that in the next few days wink wink and also of course the excellent Oppo fx8 Pro but what do you reckon of the Galaxy s25 plus have you actually got it stuffed in your pants right now it' be great to hear your thoughts your early experiences so far please do po subscribe and dig that notifications Bell for more on the latest and greatest Tech and have yourselves a ruddy wonderful rest of the week cheers everyone love you",1,"The video is a straightforward review of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus smartphone,

front page here we've got a 1-in l a main sensor 200 megapixel telephoto we've got the new Snapdragon 8 Elite chip of course a bigger battery than before and I am particularly excited about this because while last year's 14 Ultra was a very good phone the battery wasn't the best I had some overheating issues and as good as the camera was with its 1-in sensor I did find it struggled with moving subjects a little bit so I'm curious to see if they've improved it here and first thing you'll notice is that it looks like one of those guys who wears a really tight muscle fit t-shirt cuz that camera is bulging out and that really is an impressive bulge look at the size of that thing and we have a USB cable plus a little plastic case to keep your very expensive new flagship phone safe no charger in the Box though which I think we're all pretty used to now and does it have that rattle yes it does it has the same rattle as the 14 Ultra is it just the Periscope lens moving inside I swear no other phone does that anyway let's crack on with the [Music] review now sadly I have the boring color this comes in black white and a new Chrome Chrome silver this very snazzy two-tone design with carbon glass and PU leather whereas I have the black one with this glass back which is kind of boring actually and if I bring in last year's 14 Ultra and the year before 13 Ultra both of which use this kind of fake leather I don't know going back to the glass feels a little boring maybe so if you can definitely get the Chrome silver one although I think it is 3 G heavier as you can see though not a whole lot has changed over the last 3 years in terms of design these phones are dominated by this huge circular camera module housing the quad lier camera system and actually it was the 13 Ultra here which introduced the 1-in sensor and that hasn't changed significantly year on year these two also had variable apertures for the main sensor but we don't have that now weirdly they've dropped it on the 15 Ultra and I've been told the reason they've got rid of it is that the 15 Ultra can achieve comparable exposure effects through software optimizations and algorithm upgrades without the need for a hardware based very aperture or at least that's what xiaomi told me from a camera Hardware perspective the main change this year is that Periscope telephoto lens it's gone from 50 megapixels to 200 megapixels and they've also gone from a Sony sensor to a Samsung with the hp9 from my testing this actually is a decent upgrade in terms of the camera but design wise it does feel perhaps a little uninspired now it's actually a tiny bit thicker about .15 mm thicker and it weighs 10 G more than last year you've got this very very subtle curve on the edge it basically is a flat screen just with the tiniest of tapering at the edge it's a decent looking phone that might be a little bit offensive to some people but if you're buying this it's probably because you want that camera system uh although I do kind of Miss as say that PU leather that we had the last two generations it made it a bit grippier to hold it wouldn't sled out of your pocket as easily so yeah it's fine but I don't think it's necessarily a step forward we still get ip68 dust and water resistance although unlike some of its Flagship Android Rivals there's no IP 69 so I wouldn't recommend taking it into the shower with you and Blasting it with hot Jets of water which ip69 would protect against it's not a big deal but when other phones have it then you know for a flagship that costs ,300 more or less it would be nice to have pricing of the 15 Ultra will be the same as last year's 14 Ultra we're talking $12.99 here in the UK which makes it 50 Quid more than an s25 ultra but there is only one skew of this 16 gigs of RAM and 512 storage which is a higher end space than what you get with the s25 and so actually if you match them like for like not only will this still have 16 gigs versus 12 on the Samsung but the Samsung will be 50 Quid more so you could argue it's slightly better value than the Samsung offering but certainly it is still a very expensive phone and you may also want to spend a little bit more on their photography kit where you can attach this hand grip and dedicated shutter button it has its own 2,000 mAh battery and also a 67 mm filter adapter ring so you can screw on NDS and filters so the photography kit obviously costs more it adds a good deal of bulk to your phone but I don't know having a dedicated shutter button which we don't on here which seems like a bit of an emission given how camera oriented the phone is uh but also the bigger battery you know a proper grip I think if you are buying this primarily for the camera which you probably are the photography kits worth getting going back to this screen though and it really is a bit tasty I do obviously miss the anti-reflective coating you have on s25 Ultra and perhaps the honor magic 7 Pro is a pretty close rival in terms of the display but but I'm going to say this is top three not only do you get HDR 10 plus and DOL Vision the Pak HDR brightness is also a touch higher than last year now at 3200 nits they've also bumped the touch sampling rate from 240 HZ previously to 300 HZ so everything feels even more instantaneous as you press it and we have a 1920 HZ pwm or pulse width modulation so particularly lower brightness is it's more comfortable for your eyes and I also appreciate the color accuracy of the screen and you've got lots of different options to choose from oh look at that I just realized my phone screen uh matches quite nicely with the TV background there anyway let's talk about what's happened on the inside because I think this is actually a more significant upgrade not only do we have the new Snapdragon 8 Elite uh but we also have slightly faster storage it's ufs 4.1 versus 4 more importantly though we have a bigger battery 5410 milahs which is up from 5,000 on the global version of the 13 that's not the 13 the 14 Ultra although I think the Chinese version was 5300 so it's less of an upgrade but at least for me here in the UK and if you bought one globally this should be on paper quite a big upgrade in terms of battery life and it turns out it actually is and I'll come to those tests in a second so new chip bigger battery uh slightly faster storage and like last year all models get 16 gigs of RAM and 512 storage and to give you a bit of an idea here is the 13 14 and 15 Ultras uh and if I fire up geekbench 6 the 15 Ultra is 38% faster in single core and 28% faster in multicore and then in the geekbench graphics test which I'm only using because you can't actually install 3D Mark in here normally I'd put Wildlife extreme and do a stress test but you can't actually install it on xiaomi phones or at least I can't but we're also looking at a 30% optic in graphics and not only is it faster but it also runs cooler with the help of my trusty thermal imaging camera here you can see the peak temperatures after 15 minutes of gaming on the three phones but we also have what they call their NextGen 3D dual Channel ice loop system which is a bit of a F but actually is 13% larger compared to the xiaomi 14 Ultra which helps to improve heat dissipation and I'm very happy to see the 15 Ultra does run cooler so it's faster it's cooler and it lasts longer obviously with the bump from 5,000 to 5410 you'd expect it to last a good deal longer uh and also they're using a silicon carbon battery for the first time so actually the battery is the same size but it's more dense and together with the more efficient chip judging by my little video streaming test here this is just YouTube playing at 115 H brightness on Wi-Fi 133 Ultra dies at 13 hours 47 the 14 Ultra lasts over an hour longer at 14 hours 55 the 15 Ultra still has 29% left and in fact this just kept going until 21 hours and 15 minutes this is very good news because in my last couple of Flagship battery tests where I've included the 14 Ultra this has basically given the pixel phone competition for last place as much as I did like this phone I have had issues with overheating and the battery just not being very good it consistently came back at the pack so next time I do my battery test and include the 15 Ultra I think this could be up there with the best of them it is a big upgrade in battery life and we're still getting their 90 W hypercharged and also 80 W Wireless hypercharged although like most phones now it's byoc will bring you on charger one thing we still don't have though is a uwb chip or Ultra wide band not the end of the world but most other Flagship phones do offer that and it can be handy for walking up to your car and locking it or using you know smart home devices it basically gives you more accurate faster uh precise tracking of the phone we do however have Bluetooth 6 which I believe is the first time you've seen that in a phone but to some extent Bluetooth 6 May negate the need for uwb a little bit although only once more Bluetooth 6 devices come out so it's a bit annoying for now but perhaps this is more future proof and that is the xiaomi 15 Ultra let me know what you guys think of this in the comments below and can you imagine if I did finish the video without even talking about the camera it's the whole bloody Point you'd buy one of these no this is serious business to the point where I'm going to pop my glasses on here and look at some photos in fact I've taken about 800 photos on the 15 Ultra over the last couple of weeks is this much better than last year Well we still have a off camera module on the back housing this quad camera system so whereas last year we had a 3.2 and then a five times optical zoom lens with the two telephotos now we have a three and 4.3 down there although of course they still say you can have lossless zooms double that but really it's just taking a crop in so you know marketing so the headlines are four cameras the main camera has a 1-in sensor but then it also did last year and the year before that and actually that hasn't changed significantly except for the fact that it no longer has a variable aperture now it's just a fixed F 1.63 the ultra wide has also been rejigged with a different sensor we've gone from the Sony IMX 858 to the Samsung jn5 which I believe is better suited to ultrawide lenses but in doing so they've actually downgraded the aperture of the ultra wide from f1.8 last year to f2.2 now the first of the two telephoto lenses is near enough identical to last year but what really is interesting is the bump from 50 megapixels to 200 megapixels for this longer range Periscope telephoto which gives us that 4.2 times optical zoom and this also has a new and much bigger sensor it's now 1 over 1.4 in versus 1 over 2.51 in last year that's a big Improvement which means it can now take in 36% more light than on the 14 Ultra and finally up front we have near enough the same selfie camera 32 megapixels the OV 32 sensor I'm sorry is that not the cutest little house the most sort of picturesque postcard house you've ever seen it's actually next to this church it's called St cuthberts and if you're a fan of Simon and Nick Frost then you may recognize you see my little iPhone filming rig here uh the top there is wherein Hot Fuzz they push it off and it kills the journalist guys it's a horrible gruesome scene but uh yeah this is my little hometown of Wells I'm shooting this on the front selfie camera with the 15 Ultra at 4K 60 got some very bright Sunshine there which you don't see very often in February as I'm recording this it's a beautiful day look how pretty this is let me show you a whole bunch of photos taken on the new5 ultra in a variety of different color modes because for photos you can choose between like or authentic which gives you a more classic more natural tone versus like a vibrant which as shiai says will freshen up your photo it's a bit more Punchy it's a bit more vibrant and then specifically with portraits you have Leica portrait mode and this is where the color science has been done by Leica and gives you a more classic natural look with a focus on realistic colors but then you've also got Master portrait which is xiaomi's own portrait mode offering a slightly brighter more vibrant I love the fact that we have different options personally I quite like like a vibrant for photos and like a portrait well for portraits now rather than me spending the next 45 minutes boring you all to death as I show you my photos and comment on each one let me give you my takeaway this is an incredible camera that 1-in sensor with that very wide F 1.63 aperture gives you the most beautiful natural depth of field and I just love using it this is one of those cameras that just makes you excit about using it for street photography for portraits and after a couple of weeks of using this and taking hundreds and hundreds of photos in all the different modes there are some absolutely stunning shots they make you question whether that was taken on a smartphone however this still struggles with moving subjects particularly for portraits but even in just regular photo mode for every one photo where I thought holy crap that looks incredible there's probably been two or three where I've then looked and gone oh didn't quite get that there was a bit of ghosting or blurring or that person's hand was or the face was moving and I'll come to a little comparison with the 13 Ultra in a second but it was a similar issue then has it got better maybe slightly this may just be my experience it's definitely worth looking at other reviews and seeing what other people say as well but as much as I do love this camera whether it's the processing time or the shutter speed or whatever it is it's just not consistent enough what can help a little bit though is if you tap on this little running dude which turns on motion capture and I think this trades a little bit of the image quality and processing in favor of better motion Clarity having said all that let's have a little look at how it compares to last year's 14 Ultra side by side you can see the 14 often overs saturates the image when you've got strong colors it just whacks up the vibrancy and I much prefer the more neutral more realistic shots of the 15 Ultra so in terms of the white balance and the colors and the tones clear improvement with the 15 Ultra and as you would hope that periscope teleph lens gives us much sharper much more detailed long range Zoom shots and especially when you go up to say 30 times or 60 times the clarity is so much higher and for example with this lady on the lime bike the 15 Ultra is much sharper and more detailed and just generally it's quite surprising how much of a difference the overall reduced contrast and less oversharpened look can make with a 15 Ultra it doesn't come across like a phone camera anymore I also quite like that the ultra wide has a less Ultra wide field of view it's now 14 mm rather than 12 mm last year but Ultra wide photos are also better perhaps it's due to the new sensor or the improved processing and in low light especially the orange lightings become red and taken over the whole room on the 14 Ultra I'm also happy to report that while the selfie camera Hardware hasn't changed whatever magic is going on behind the scenes has actually improved the image quality as well there's more texture the colors are more realistic especially skin tones and this portrait shot looks kind of horrible on the 40 whenever I'm here in London making one of these videos testing a camera what people are most impressed by is the fact that I haven't had my phone nicked yet out of my hand as I'm walking around with it so far so good as with most phones I think photography is still the main priority but the 15 Ultra still gives us a very good video camera I'm here in London on a pretty gloomy day and I think the image quality is very nice it definitely has that quite strong lier aesthetic to the colors everything's a little bit more contrasty the Shadows are heavier and unless you shoot in log you can't really get away from that but I do want to give xiaomi credit for not only giving us really smooth transitions between the lenses even shooting at 4K 60 you can go right from the ultra wide up to the Periscope telephoto but hats off to xiaomi for giving us really consistent colors and wide balance and quality as you switch between the lenses in my opinion Oppo has been the best for this for a while but now I think xiaomi's right up there with them and just wondering around trifala square there's so many performers there's this chap on his typewriter doing poems and actually if you saw my find N5 review the foldable phone recently he actually wrote me a whole poem for foldable phones there is an appreciable drop in quality when you go back to the ultra wide lens and then when you do zoom into the telephotos while the quality is still very good the stabilization isn't quite as good you can feel the vibrations of my walking you can also shoot in 4k 120 and while the stabilization isn't as good at this level really this is about slowing it down for some 4K slow and so playing back at 25% speed with good lighting it actually comes out quite nicely so now going over to the pr mode in the camera app which if I'm honest I don't tend to use that much myself but I do like that you can save your own presets and even better for me import them as well now I just need some Pro photographers to share their presets online also in the camera settings menu there's lots to play around with but I would recommend turning on Smart noise reduction and also make sure Auto frame rate is off and also change picture quality to Super it's only on high by default I also think turning on rule of thirds guidelines as well as the center and straighten lines makes it easier to frame your shots you can even customize the style of the shutter button and the sound it makes and finally the software this ships running Android 15 with Hyper OS 2 on top that's xiaomi's own UI and if you've used one of their phones in the last few years this will feel pretty familiar with its vertical recently used apps menu and absolute ton of pre-installed apps AKA bloatware it's not my favorite it's not bad it's fine and they do promise four years of Android updates and actually I think the xiaomi offers the most comprehensive AI toolkit outside of the s25 ultra with an absolute ton of photo editing tools from AI image expansion and AI eraser and reflection removal and enhancing Clarity and the usual array of transcription and summarization tools the notes there's nothing really to write home about in terms of the software experience or the AI features but it does everything pretty well and most importantly it all feels fast and responsive so overall the 15 Ultra is a big step up we have the new chip which obviously is faster it RS cooler we have a much longer battery life we also have an improved camera with the caveat that photos can still be blury from time to time I wish it was just a little bit more consistent if you've got any questions about this drop a comment below if you enjoyed the video a thumbs up and a subscribe would be fantastic and all those annoying YouTuber things and I'll see you next time right here on the tech chap",1,The video is a detailed review of the

Surprisingly, the Pixel 9 is available for sale in the UEE. So, I couldn't wait to get my hands on one of the units to show you everything you need to know and answer all your questions. So, please subscribe and hit the bell icon as a lot of videos about the latest Pixel 9 are in the pipeline. And now, let's begin. Starting with the design and builder quality. At first, I didn't know if I like or hate the new design language of the A series, but after some time, I kind of like it. It's simple and clean, which is something I always lean to. Even though the camera visor is gone, but the pill-shaped camera housing gives it the same pixel identity we got used to. Another advantage is you don't need to worry about the dust accumulating under the camera visor or getting scratched over time. But what I do like for sure is the loudspeaker placement. It's back again to the right side. So, I no longer covered the speaker in landscape orientation unlike the 9 Pro XL. So, thank you Google for listening to the feedback and I hope to see the same with the Pixel 10. The matte finish aluminum rail is another plus over the flagship model that has a glossy finish. Additionally, holding the phone feels so comfortable and everything is easily reachable with one hand. Plus, it's very light. It only weighs 186 g, so it certainly wins in the comfort. Talking about the front, that's the biggest trade-off in the design. The bezels of this phone are massive. Imagine if it got the same bezels of the 9 Pro. It would have looked so much better, but after some time, I got used to it. I recommend not to look at any other phone with thin bezels to make it easier for yourself. Moving to the build quality, the display is covered with Gorilla Glass 3, so the drop protection is not great. That's why my Lion A display broke after slipping from my pocket while sitting in a restaurant. I created a video about this incident, but then I removed it because I said the drop distance is 25 cm, but I had doubts and later I found that the drop distance to be about 35 cm. At the end of the day, it's my mistake, but I expected it to be more durable. Similarly, the back material feels very cheap and hollow, but thankfully it's made of plastic, so you don't need to worry about breaking it. I recommend installing a case and a screen protector immediately after purchasing this phone. In contrast, the phone's structure is very solid and it doesn't flex whatsoever. Same as the buttons that are also wellmade and tactile. Beside this, the IP rating improved when compared to its predecessor. It's up from IP67 to 68 to match the flagship models, which is nice. Overall, I like how comfortable, light, and compact is the Pixel 9a. Additionally, it got higher IP rating and perfectly placed loudspeaker, but the front and back materials and bezels are the biggest drawbacks of this phone. Now, let's talk about the display in terms of quality and features. It's more of a flagship display rather than a mid-range. So, let me tell you why. It supports adaptive touch, same as the 9 Pro, which means it works nicely with wet hands. Something like this you won't find in the S25 Ultra. The peak brightness is 2700 nits, same as Samsung flagships, but slightly lower than the 3,000 nits of the 9 Pro models. But in this sideby-side comparison with the 9 Pro XL, it doesn't feel like you are missing anything. Even the 120 Hz refresh rate is here, same as any flagship. The resolution is certainly lower than the 9 Pro XL, but the PPI is 422, so it looks sharp and the colors are on point. Same as any highquality display. Plus, the size is up from 6.1 in last year's model to 6.3 in. So, what are you missing here when compared to the Pro models? First, it doesn't support the LTPO technology. So, the refresh rate doesn't go down to one herz like the Pro models. Secondly, it doesn't have an ambient light sensor on the back like the Pro models. And that's it. Overall, the display exceeded my expectations. Getting all these features at this price is just a great deal. I think Apple should take a note. They sell the 16e for $599, which is $100 more than the 9A with a 60 Hz refresh rate, $1,200 net brightness and a 6.1 in display with no adaptive touch support, which says a lot. So, well done Google on the display. One last thing I want to talk about is the PWM deming. Based on my testing, it's certainly faster than the 9 Pro XL as shown now on the screen. I'm not sure about the actual numbers, but I'm happy to see an improvement. Before jumping to the next category, let me tell you about the wallpapers by in-depth thick reviews app. If you like any of the wallpapers you see in this video, you will find them as part of the collection, so you can enjoy them on your phone right now. Plus, I added these 12 new wallpapers to the collection that look great on any smartphone. You will find Google Play Store download link in the description. And now, let's get back to the review. Now, it's time to talk about the performance. Let me start right away by showing you the Geekbench 6 scores compared to the 9 Pro XL. Keep in mind that the 9A is running January update with no software updates available yet versus Marsh update on the 9 Pro XL and the results are close. It's about 300 and 200 points less in the multi and single core scores respectively, which is not bad. But the trade-off here is in the RAM. The 9A has 8 gigs versus 16 in the 9 Pro XL. So, let me show you a quick app launching and RAM management test. [Music] Hey. [Music] As you saw, the app launching speed is very comparable and it did win the 9 Pro XL in some apps. So, let's try the RAM management. [Music] In this area, the 9A showed its weaknesses. It closed almost every app while the 9 Pro XL didn't. But it's too early to assess as I found that the 9A is running an older kernel from October 2024 while the 9 Pro XL is on Jan 2025 version. So, let's wait and see what will happen after software updates. I also tried the 9a in video calling, watching HDR videos, and playing games. I found that the phone gets hot, but it doesn't lag or stutter. For example, when I play games on maximum settings, the temperature goes up to 40° C in a heavy game like Genshin Impact. With that said, I was able to play Asphalt Unite on maximum settings with a consistent 60 frames per second for 20 minutes without any overheating on cellular data. When it comes to Genshin Impact on cellular data with the highest settings and manually adjusting the FPS to 60 instead of 30, I didn't notice any lag, but the phone got too warm, reaching 43° C after playing for 20 minutes, and the actual FPS ranged between 36 to 62. Then I tried Genchin Impact once more on medium settings. The temperature maxed out at 40° and the FPS ranged between 50 to 60. But either way, the game remained playable in both scenarios with no major issues. So overall, the performance is quite good, but the phone gets hot and the RAM management is not great. Hopefully that will be fixed with the updated kernel and software. So I will revisit this when it gets updated. Moving to the battery, the 9ae is the first Pixel that comes with a 5100 milliamp battery. So everyone is expecting a great battery life for having a bigger capacity and lower specs. I didn't have enough time to test it in all scenarios, but I tried it for a full day only on cellular data with the 5G set to auto light theme and the 120 Hz refresh rate is activated. I was able to get 6 hours and 8 minutes of a screen on time with 5% battery left. I expected more than this, but I'm sure Marsh update will improve this number quite a lot. On a side note, the standby time seems to be the main issue so far. So, let me show you the numbers. The phone was connected to my home Wi-Fi network. Then I slept at 6:00 a.m. with 94% battery left and woke up at 3:17 p.m. with 81% battery, which is a total of 9 hours and 17 minutes of standby time, which means it lost 1.4% per hour, which is too high. The next day, I did the same experiment, but on cellular data and 100% battery. I slept at 6:00 a.m. and woke up at 1:25 p.m. with 91% left. The standby time was 7.42 42 hours. So, it lost 1.2% per hour, which is surprisingly better than Wi-Fi, but still higher than expected. Again, Marshall Update did solve most of these issues with older models. So, I better revisit these numbers when it gets updated. Lastly, the charging speed. It supports 23 Wired and 7.5 wireless with no reverse wireless charging support. Based on my testing, I was able to charge it from 16% to 100 in 1 hour and 53 minutes using my 45 W fast charger, which is very slow in my opinion. Overall, in the battery, the screen on time seems to be fine, but I expected much lower standby usage. So, let's wait for the software updates to see if things will get any better. For the charging speed, Google needs to consider improving this for the whole Pixel lineup, not just the A series. Now, let's talk about the camera. The 9A has two lenses, a 13 megapixel ultra wide and a 48 megapixel main camera with a 13 megapixel selfie. These numbers are underwhelming when compared to the 9 Pro XL. But I did a quick camera comparison to see how far behind is the 9a. Surprisingly, the results exceeded my expectations in a lot of areas. But first, let me highlight that the 9a doesn't have a pro mode. So, all photos are taken at the default 12 megapixel resolution on both. Starting with morning photos, the only difference between the two is the 9 Pro XL tends to saturate the colors a bit more, while the 9a is more true to life. Other than this, from 0.5x up to 2x, everything look almost identical with only some few exceptions. Even in the toughest situations, like directly pointing the camera towards the sun, they did perform identically. Switching to portraits, the 9 Pro XL softens the skin, which is something I started to see after Marsh update, while the 9A doesn't. It depends on your personal taste, but in this scenario, I like the 9 Pro more. When it comes to subject isolation, the 9A tends to miss a lot of areas in the forground, while the 9 Pro XL does much better, but the 9A is better in isolating my face, especially when you look around my hair. But both are not great and it can go as bad as this, which is crazy. So, please Google, take it seriously. Moving to the front camera, the 9 Pro XL's higher resolution and the wider field of view are obviously better, but the 9A did a great job, too. The details are still good. The colors are almost identical, and the field of view is acceptable, but it tends to show more lens flares than the 9 Pro XL in harsh conditions. In the zoom, the 9a is nowhere near the 9 Pro XL that has a dedicated 48 megapixel 5x telephoto. This shot was taken at 8x on both, which is the maximum range of the 9A. There are some details that don't even exist in the 9A shot. And here's another example that shows the same. Any photo taken beyond the 2x mark looks better on the 9 Pro XL. Even at 4x, which doesn't involve the 9 Pro XL telephoto, still looks better than the 9A, which is expected. When it comes to macros, this is the first time to get this feature on the A series. And in this comparison, the 9 Pro XL has way better focus, while the 9a can only focus on the center part and blur anything else. But you get tons of details on both. Now, let's talk about videos. Starting with the ultra wide, the main difference is in the colors and details. The 9 Pro XL is more saturated with a slightly better details while the stabilization looks identical to me. Also, keep in mind that the 9A doesn't support video boost. And later in this chapter, I will show you the full list of missing features. Switching to the main lens, the same story repeats itself. They share the same stabilization with more saturated colors and slightly better details coming from the 9 Pro XL, but the 9a is not far behind. So, I'm happy to see the budget model performing that close to the flagship. Switching to the front camera, the 9A takes good videos, but as I mentioned before, it has more lens flares with a narrower field of view, which gives the edge to the 9 Pro XL, but overall, I'm happy with the quality and the HDR performance. Now, let's compare the night photos and videos. Starting with the ultra wide, you will immediately see more noise in the sky with less details coming from the 9a, which has a smaller and lower resolution sensor. But at 1x, the noise level is almost identical with the same colors, white balance, and contrast. But the 9 Pro XL photos are a tiny bit more detailed. Even at 2x, the 9a still doing a great job. And by the way, these photos are taken without night sight. Here's another shot at the same settings. Again, the 9ae has more noise in the sky and less details in the ultra wide photos, but the main camera produces almost identical results, same as the 2x images. And I'm happy that both did handle the bright signs really well. In the third scenario, the 9a brightened up the image a bit too much, but I think it has to do with the software as the 9 Pro XL used to do the same prior Marsh update, but things improved. So, I hope to see the same improvements reaching the 9A when it becomes officially available. Let me also show you one last scenario, but this time with night sight on both, which improved the 9A ultra wide shots quite a lot, but still not as good as the 9 Pro XL in terms of details and noise. At 1x, you cannot tell them apart. They look identical to me, and the same applies to the 2x zoom. And now, let's compare the portraits. In this 2x portrait, the 9A did better with the colors. It shows the exact colors of my outfit, while the 9 Pro XL image has a magenta hue. In subject isolation, it's the same as morning photos. The 9A doesn't blur parts of the background, which is worse than the 9 Pro XL, but it does better in isolating my face, especially when you look around my ears. And as I mentioned before, the 9 Pro XL softens the skin after Marshall update while the 9A doesn't. Overall, in this scenario, I would pick the 9A image as it offers the best overall look with more accurate colors. At 1.5x, you will see the same differences, and I'm still leaning towards the 9A shot. Let's try another scenario, and this time, both have two different looks. The 9 Pro XL image is leaning towards warmer tones, while the 9A is cooler. I'm not sure which one is more accurate here, but I prefer the 9 Pro XL colors this time. Plus, the 9a didn't blur a big portion of the background, but it's still better in isolating my face. Here's the 1.5x version of the same shot that also shows the same differences. Moving to the selfies, I got mixed results. In the first example, the 9a had less noise and brighter shadows, while the 9 Pro XL did the opposite. It showed more noise in the sky and darker shadows. For me, if I'm going to pick one, I would certainly go for the 9a. In the second scenario, the 9 Pro XL had a much better image in everything, the noise, the details, and colors. But taking the same shot with a slight change in the angle, the results changed again. The 9A did well this time. So, overall, the 9 Pro XL takes better selfies, same as morning photos. Switching to the zoom at 8x on both. As expected, the 9 Pro XL wins in terms of details, but the colors of the 9A are much better and look more true to life. Plus, it has less noise in the sky. And here's one more scenario that confirms the same. I hope to see the colors of the 9A with the details of the 9 Pro XL in the same shot to get the best of both worlds. Let me also show you a couple of macro shots. At night, the 9 Pro XL tends to saturate the colors with the same wider focus as morning photos, but both do offer tons of details. And here's another shot that confirms the same. And lastly, let's compare night videos. The 9a ultra wide produces a lot of noise with less details, while the 9 Pro XL is much better in everything, but unfortunately, none of them was able to handle the bright side well. Overall, the ultra wide videos of the 9a reminds me of the Pixel 5 videos, which is not great. And if you're wondering about the image stabilization, the 9 Pro XL is miles ahead, even though both were almost identical in morning videos. Switching to the main camera, most of the 9A issues disappear and becomes closer to the 9 Pro XL, but is still not as clean or detailed as the flagship model. The differences become even more visible when I switch to 2X. The 9a video becomes softer and the overall quality is not as good as the 9 Pro XL, but there is no big difference in the image stabilization. Switching to the front camera, the quality is not good on both. But the 9 Pro XL is certainly the better option, at least for the wider field of view and slightly less noise. And this is one of the areas that needs a lot of focus from Google. So, that's everything you need to know about the camera. I think the overall camera experience is good enough for the price, but the lack of video boost and poor quality portraits are my main concerns. When it comes to the software, I will have a dedicated video right after this one talking about the supported and missing features of the Pixel 9a when compared to the Pro models. So, if you are interested to know, please consider subscribing and hit the bell icon to get notified when it's published. So, let's end this video by talking about the basics. And I will start with the speakers. Thankfully, they are much better than what I thought. They are loud and clear. And here's a side-by-side comparison with the 9 Pro XL. You better wear your headphones to hear the difference and judge which one sounds better. [Music] Let me go. Feeling the lumps inside you and the black eyes make my way into your mind just to know what you Christmas. Every time we start laughing as a I lost control. Oh, it's moving to the modem. It gave me a solid cellular reception, a great call quality with voice over LTE support in the UEE for those who ask and high 5G speeds. As shown here, I was able to reach 610 download and 116 upload indoors. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to compare this to the 9 Pro XL as the 5G stopped working after installing Android 16. But comparing the Wi-Fi speed, it couldn't reach the same speeds of the 9 Pro XL that was able to get 890 download and 338 upload, while the 9A maxed out at 577 and 311 respectively. I tried multiple times but with no luck. So hopefully things will change with future updates. Moving to the haptics, the 9a does offer very precise and good haptic feedback, same as all other Pixels, but it's a tiny bit less refined when compared to the 9 Pro XL. I think it's related to the body structure. The lighter and thinner materials of the 9A doesn't give the same premium feeling, but it's still great. Last but not least, the unlocking experience in this area. The 9A did really well. First, it supports face unlock with the same security level as the 9 Pro XL that can be used in banking apps. Plus, it works with minimal light. Here's a trial in low light, and the face unlock still works fine, giving me the same experience as the 9 Pro XL. When it comes to the fingerprint, it has an optical sensor, not the same ultrasonic one used in the flagship model, which is not as fast, but it was accurate enough to unlock my phone every single time. I'm not using a screen protector, so I'm not sure how it will impact its performance. So, that's everything I wanted to talk about in my in-depth review for the Pixel 9. This phone ticks a lot of boxes, and it's a great value for money, but the most annoying things to me are the lowquality front and back materials, the thick bezels, and the lack of video boost. Other than this, I think the trade-offs are reasonable for $499. It just needs some software updates to address the issues I came across in different areas, especially the RAM management, performance, and battery usage, which I'm confident that Marshall update will make them much better. So, that's pretty much it for today. That was my in-depth review for the Pixel 9a. Please let me know in the comments what do you think. But for now, thanks so much for watching and see you in the next",1,The video transcript is a straightforward review of the Google Pixel 9a smartphone

OH THAT'S AMAZING ISAIAH THOMAS IS HE SIX FEET TALL. >> ON A GOOD DAY. >> I THOUGHT HE WAS FIVE SEVEN ON A GOOD DAY. JUST KIDDING ISAIAH. >> THE THING ABOUT THIS TOO IS DETROIT PROBABLY GOING HOME NOW SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT THIS COULD REALLY EASILY BE A TWO NOTHING SERIES. >> YEAH BUT YOU CAN'T THINK LIKE THAT. YOU LIKE NOW THE PRESSURE SWITCHES TO DETROIT. GAME THREE IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU LOSE GAME THREE IT DON'T MATTER WHAT HAPPENED. YOU CAN SAY WE'RE UP TWO LIKE NO WE'RE DOWN, DOWN 2 TO 1. SO I ALWAYS THINK WHEN YOU GET A SPLIT ON THE ROAD, I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT NEXT GAME AT HOME, BECAUSE YOU GOT TO PUT THAT OTHER TEAM UNDER PRESSURE. THEY'VE GOT TO THE KNICKS. IF THEY CAN WIN GAME THREE, THEY DON'T FEEL PRESSURE. BUT IF YOU CAN WIN THAT GAME THREE, IF YOU'RE DETROIT NOW, THE PRESSURE REALLY SWITCHES TO THE KNICKS. YEAH, BUT I WAS I WAS HAPPY WHEN CADE CUNNINGHAM THE AFTERMATH THE FIRST GAME HE SAID IT WAS FUN. NO EXCUSES FOR HAVING A BAD GAME. HE HAD WAS FUN. SO I KNEW HE WAS GOING TO COME IN WITH THAT SUPREME FOCUS FOR GAME TWO. HE PLAYED WELL. LIKE HE SAID, HE CAN'T WAIT TO GET BACK. THEY JUST CAN'T BE, YOU KNOW, TOO HAPPY THAT THEY'RE AT HOME. I AGREE THEY GOT TO PUT THIS TEAM AWAY AND I THINK THEY WILL BECAUSE THE OTHERS PLAY GREAT AT HOME. >> YEAH. SO ANOTHER GUY WHO'S MAKING HIS PLAYOFF DEBUT, JALEN DUREN SEVEN POINTS AND SIX REBOUNDS IN THE OPENER. AND HE GOES FOR 12 AND 13 TONIGHT. SO A LOT OF STUFF CLICKING FOR DETROIT IN THIS ONE KENNY. >> WELL THERE THE KNICKS HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO BE MORE ATHLETIC AND MAYBE ADD ONE MORE PERSON INTO THEIR ROTATION. BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT CUNNINGHAM, YOU LOOK AT DUREN, YOU LOOK AT THOMPSON, YOU LOOK AT ALL THE ATHLETES. BEASLEY. YOU KNOW THEY HAVE ATHLETES. AND AT SOME POINT THEY'RE THE KNICKS. RESISTANCE HAS TO START AT THE HALF COURT ON DEFENSE WHERE NOW IT'S STARTING LIKE FREE THROW LINE TO THREE POINT LINE. SO ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY'RE PUSHING THE BASKETBALL. AND THE ATHLETES ARE PUSHING THAT BASKETBALL AND STARTING THEIR OFFENSE BELOW THE THREE POINT LINE. SO THEY'RE GETTING TOO DEEP INTO THE OFFENSIVE SETS. AND I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE THE KNICKS AREN'T ATHLETIC ENOUGH RIGHT NOW BY ONLY PLAYING. >> AND AS I SAID EARLIER TOBIAS HARRIS HE WAS HUGE TONIGHT. BUT THE TWO GUYS WHO GOT TO STEP UP AT HOME ARE TIM HARDAWAY JUNIOR AND MALIK BEASLEY. MALIK BEASLEY HAS HAD A FANTASTIC YEAR. HARDAWAY IS A TERRIFIC SCORER. THEY'VE GOT TO GIVE DUREN AND CUNNINGHAM SOME HELP. TOBIAS DID IT TONIGHT. BUT YOUR VETERAN GUYS MAN THEY GOT TO STEP UP. >> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF KARL ANTHONY TOWNS NIGHT. DID NOT SCORE IN THE SECOND HALF. >> THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. YEAH THAT CAN'T HAPPEN. THAT CAN'T HAPPEN. HE PLAYED REALLY BIG IN THE FIRST HALF. AND YOU KNOW HE'S ACTUALLY THE SECOND PART OF THAT ONE TWO PUNCH. THAT COULD NEVER HAPPEN IN NEW YORK IN A PLAYOFF SERIES. HE KNOWS BETTER I JUST GOT A STAT FROM UNDERDOG. HE SAID HE PLAYED THE ENTIRE FOURTH QUARTER AND DIDN'T EVEN ATTEMPT A SHOT. >> YEAH. NO. >> THAT'S THAT'S CRAZY. >> YEAH. >> THAT'S CRAZY BECAUSE I KNOW I CAN'T SPEAK I KNOW SHAQ WELL ENOUGH. IF WE IN A CLOSE GAME THAT'S HE GOING TO CURSE SOMEBODY OUT OR SAY SOMETHING. >> BIG DOG DON'T GET FED. >> AND I CAN GUARANTEE YOU IF I'M IN A CLOSE GAME AND THEY DON'T PASS ME THE BALL, SOME STUFF GOING TO HAPPEN, SOME STUFF GOING TO HAPPEN, PLAIN AND SIMPLE. >> TONIGHT WHAT HAPPENED WAS 100 TO 90 FOR THE DETROIT PISTONS, EVEN UP THE SERIES AT A GAME APIECE WITH THE KNICKS AND AGAIN GOING TO DETROIT ON THURSDAY. YES, INDEED. NICE HAND. HOW MUCH HOW MUCH OF THAT ARE YOU DRINKING? >> HEY YOU DO ONE SHOT A DAY SHAQ. YEP. DOUBLE SHOT, DOUBLE SHOT. >> TWO SHOTS A DAY. >> ACTUALLY DEPENDS. CALL ME UP.

them and he scored three goals two sitting in that Midfield Premiership matches and they will be looking to avoid it's fair to say that neither of these teams are in the best of form at late but it is an opportunity for Kaiser Chiefs as we get underway here to just put themselves games in hand over most in the division three in fact over kaisa Chiefs will be looking to close the gap on their opponents today they're currently in 10th they are five points behind amama corus they are the side that play exactly producing a fabulous performance good strong running from Lio oh no hesitation there from l in pointing to the spot and it has been Achilles heel for lamontville Golden arrows this season they have already conceded four goals from penalties that's more than any other side and Chiefs have a chance from 12 yards yeah there's contact and the ball is already gone M who is without a goal this season oh he's hit the [Applause] upright wow what was that the right call then because you have some very uh Norman Smith has a look at the earlier action youf Mar just sidling up to the ball there and striking it onto the woodwork which by the way it's the 11th time K there nothing quite like scoring a goal to get the fans on your sides oh and now a huge mistake from do decent enough recovery from inas Miguel but still the chance is on and blocked away Angela fy's effort I like him that's the acction I was talking about when he faces goal when he's on the line he really challenges he's not afraid to take on the defender simang just in time to Nick that ball away from him was it 18 times last season so he's closing in on that clever from d f just over the top good movement he he gives the pass it's a given take and is a break through but it's a nice loed pass to find him but once again like I mentioned earlier he's a a right footed player so his left is not the strongest tries to side foot it instant now for Golden Arrows with an opport Unity after another Ka of chiefs mistake and they don't make the most of it g fenroy in the thick of things putting himself Under Pressure Kyle Chiefs goalkeeper of Club records that's a good ball and really close to finding the opener flashed across the face of goal and seir lurking at the back post can't make the right kind of connection I like that I like his movement he's unting that b might come through there he's already lacking and with expectation now who got it touch it was it the oh the defender got I guess now you can tell that he's very uncomfortable with that left another day I'm sure he would have done better no whistle two on one here for arrows and they just roll it in dza Saia applies the finishing touch knocking it into an empty net it was the Persistence of nox matisa who created that chance and Midway through the first half the mon for Golden arrows who of late have had Chief's number are up and running here at the Moses maida Stadium it's a buildup that breaks down for KA cheese and when you're on the front fot in your CAU in that situation you'll be found wanting No Rest defense and as a result has all the time and it does well holds on to the ball the longest to try and force the defender to commit and uh in fact he Dives I'm not sure if it's simango who dives in there I think he should have just waited the longest before he commits in that fashion because if you go down in that fashion desperate to make him in as Gaston Serino feeds him he can and does well Yousef Mt misses from the penalty spot and then from open play gets his first goal of the Season as Kaiser Chiefs hit back within minutes fantastic that's the way to respond from a disappointment of that nature I mean he was looking for a moment like this and he jully came and he didn't disappoint and supporters must understand that these things do happen and uh that's the best way to respond I'm happy for him I was I was worried about just how was z c with the rest of the game having made that mistake so early that is amazing and from a good play as well nice combination pass Sereno obviously a big part of it he's the man that knows how to measure a pass through but you got to give it operating with just 10 men can Ka the Chiefs take advantage Gaston Serino lovely take and then worldwide of goal by the underlapping Solomons sometimes I always like to see Defenders takeing their Chance in This fashion if that ball is hit hard into that f post there's always a chance but it's just that he misses it and if you look at what options did he have for cut back or something me this this are the type of games that he can shine now flag stays down elamont for Golden Arrow a scored a huge opportunity massive chance for Angelo fenroy you can't believe it you you see this is exactly what could have happened on the other side because of the Highline that Chiefs are playing I mean you know for each team it's one ball that breaks the whole of the back four so we see the two chiefs youngsters Wy LBA who had been out for some time with injury but made his return just before the international break against Richard's Bay it's been a quiet game for Ashley depress I don't think it's you have got zero reaction time to B to so the latest change se's guest in Sereno withdrawn and the former arrows man P Mori is onto the park oh this is a a chance put wide in any case the flag was up just a little bit slower and getting himself back I don't think he expected much of the ball to come back to him that quickly but can safely say that the tide has turned in favor of kaer chiefs although the one for Golden arrows are particularly dangerous from these kind of moments where they get on the break and here's camanti ball across oh they've reestablished their lead and it is nox mortia the alltime top scorer in this tie who gets on the end of that fabulous cross from the returning sandam TTI who we mentioned that has this ability to to take on the fullback in some form and he did exactly what we know he can do and that he is done when he first arrived and delivered the quality that that Chiefs Defenders weren't able to close I think for the most part they tried their best given between given and Miguel they did their best to cut some of those crosses but this one was top quality and guess who is waiting on the far side of that box is Mu he just rolls it in almost equally the same like SP rolled that one in the first half ball watching between him tto and I don't know who was the other Defender the impact of Santi upon his return from injury is a fantastic one he provides his fourth betway Premiership assist of the season does Santi it's five goal contributions in total he does have a goal as well as YF Mar joins tabani zuk in the book has been a fairly good tempered game seir oh se's ball just past the upright well took uh a few deflections there I think had it gone in would have gone down as an blocked shots as well it's just yeah it's not the kind

[Music] We last saw Paul Varelia when Justin Brownley shot an epic triple in front of him. But now getting a new role. Maybe maybe later on he will be tasked to defend against Bolic as well. But right now it's on Bik Torres picking up from where he left off opening the scoring here in this ball game. of Tana, one of the top contenders for best player of the conference. JP Aram making the first bucket for TNT in this match. And I think without RSJ, you're going to see a a little bit more of that. Yeah, in the low post because they will need a lot of different offensive options here uh with TNT. Top ball screen. Torres dribbles to a spot. Felt the contact. Two for two early. Looking for the bonus now. player, not a ball screen player at all. He's capable, but not elite as as a as a ball screen player, but every year he's added something. When he got to FPU, he was not a defender at all, but he became a good defender uh when he graduated and that's helping him in the PBA center. Their tallest player on the floor is Anthony Sean, who's really more of a three. Yes. And and that's why they're JT got a little too obvious where they wanted that basketball to go as Nambatak conference from downtown ties a ball game at seven apiece transition but on a miss shot like that there's Nambatak usually closed out better than that Bik versus of Dana he's asking for a ball screen he rejects it with a quick first step all the way home for a layup took away the ball screen, but Bollock with a nice counter, rejecting the [Music] screen. Almost four minutes gone by here in our first quarter and next switching. A lot of these ball screens are our Pagoy though takes one right between the eyes of Anthony Sea. But he he made them pay for it. But one one thing that you can say about that guy, he works so hard. and he puts in hours and hours. I like the start and the energy with of of of TNT. Usually after Torres left open comes up short. Made his first three attempts. Missed his last three. One five. Nambataka lost the ball. Sear on the attack. Tony bodying up his defender. Forced to a miss. Valdez misses as well. One more try. Finally, it falls for [Music] Eno matched up against Kelly Williams. Hand off pin down screen. Roger in and out on the triple. On the other side, we go off. Tana misses his three-point shot as well. [Music] Polic advantage. They might give him the wall back. No. Seamar decides to take a shot. It rattles home. Now Seamar has size advantage against Nambatak, but they decide not to pursue it. Drive and kick. Roger. Another miss. But the offensive rebounding has been siding with the Road [Music] Warriors. And now TNT pushes forwardin. His kick out pass was off. picked off by Robert Bolik. Mishandles the dribble off the spin. Strong move coming from the youngster. 12 per contest in the entire conference. So you know that they keep those to a minimum. And Ciso will try again. This time he connects. What an addition and something that you just got for free. Basically you just signed him up, scooped him up. 5G trop 5G. I I I was sure I was sure I was going to make a mistake at some point. Robert Bolik M doing a great job of staying in front. Ain Oh, loses. Bolling on the in and out and completes the highlight with a layup. And the current school ID at the PB office in Libby is joining fee is 5,000 per minute. For inquiries, you can call 0284702768 local 264. Look up for Miss Rosel, Miss Isabelle, Miss Shazel, or Mr. Neil to join our Batang PBA program. Good pass coming from Ramirez. The extra pass. Bajio scores another bucket. He has been a consistent source of points from the second unit. He has ball screen action. Alas creates the separation. Kick out pass. Roger. Another try from deep. Finally, it falls. Let's see if Van Lex will be able to heat up from that distance. They had 11 conversions against Rain or Shine or with a size advantage and he uses it to the hilt as Boon checks back into it. Mo good pass. NTO lefty layup is good with a foul. When you have a smart Small forward, power forward in moon. You have to stay active. Ramirez hand off to Neto. Matt sends it inside now. Ramirez power move missing. Dominic Farardo with the offensive rebound. Jumper's good for JB Mo. Second chance opportunities opening up for the Road Warriors. So far, that's the stall of the game. That's the biggest advantage of N Lex, the offensive rebounding and second chance points. His pass lands Iona scores inside. Oh, but quickly on the other side left and mark was Brandon Ramirez. It was a big to bath in the Commissioner Cup losing their first two games. You saw no signs of panic coming from the squad of coach Shes, but now they're facing an 11point deficit. as they are struggling to get into an offensive rhythm here. Bollock to Valdez inside. He scores. Still down double digits against the Road Warriors. Torres, the runner is good. He's on attack mode throughout this game as he leads all scorers with nine. A lot of teams will hope to prevent that grand slam and win the championship for themselves. Good pass, Kelly Williams scoring inside. Bollock admitting the mistake. Important for JV Moan to shoot at a high percentage. I think that's key for his career. Now a 16-point lead. Kelly Williams missed an attack like that earlier. Takes care of it this time. Less than a minute remaining here in our first half of action. Enoch well read by Simon and Ciso. Now a chance for Kelly Williams and the rest of TNT to score on the break. What a pass locating Kobin inside. A strong one for the Enlex Road Warriors, but Glen Kobin will get offense of these three guys. You're not going to win against against Lex. Torres launching from deep. Rattles one home. Wow. A time out in Aram. yanked out of the ball game because of that blown coverage in one play. If if you cannot follow the the defensive scheme, you cannot play for Ches. That's for sure. Torres runs into trouble. And now Pagoy is ahead and he is gone for the layup. But there's no foul call. RR Pagoy, he needs to get himself going and that certainly helps. And again, when you're attacking in transition, the shots are easier for you. And Al aggressive that time. Eight-point disadvantage. Bowling. Another miss, but he will recover the possession. No refresh on the shot clock. Five remaining. Bowling for three. It's sweet. [Music] Ellam got switched onto Bollic there and uh it's a little bit too much space given by Ellam for Bollic to take that three. Quiet game so far for Robert Bollick. Seven points but still enough to send their lead back up to 11 of Dana counter three is gone. That's a nice thing there for Nex. That's the important thing. The first the steal by Pago and then the offensive rebound by Kubentin. They both missed the layups that they should have made, but we're seeing more energy from TNT as this is a great answer from Roger to a bit. I mean, silence this run a bit by TNT. Just calm the waters and extend their lead back up to 857 to 49. Eddie Williams loses the basketball. Netto on the attack leaves it for Pakio and he takes it strong for two. Eight points off the bench. 13-point lead for Enlexto on the attack. He spins one hand. They're in traffic. It's gone. That makes it nearly impossible really to win a grand slam because you're competing with only maybe a mentally and phys physically exhausting. It'll have to start from them alongside Nata. Good blow by coming from Eniso showing us glimpses of what he can deliver here for TNT. Converting on the lift. Syos Torres kicks it out. Alas three-point shot and gone. [Music] And that was created by the penetration of Syos Torres. That's the difference here. We're not seeing any TNT player consistently getting inside the paint and that's why the three-point shot has not been open for them. And Ceso now taking matters into his own hands. Another two-point conversion put on the line for Simon. Well, it'll have to start now. If TNT wants to come back into this game, they need to work double time to get back into it. Good swing coming from Ramirez. Three though is short coming from Alas. Kobin against Ramirez. Oh, a big collision and Kobin scores on the end one. Initiate the contact a bit just enough so that you don't get caught for an offensive foul. And uh I'm starting to feel bad really for for Ramirez especially with this lineup. Noak noana fugay should be your main point of attack. Again, all the shots in the shaded area, all the paint touches for Nex leading to this strong performance in their third game of the Philippine [Music] Cup. McCoy with the ball screen with Ceso Kubunten. Nice pass. Kelly Williams scores with the left hand against Data. [Music] 3 seconds to score. Bollock opted for the fadeaway jumper. It's good for two. I've always like that when they put Bolic in the low post from time to time because he he definitely can score from there and he's also a good passer. That will be a flopping technical foul again for the Nlex Road Warriors. Nambatak blocked from behind. That pass tap but recovered by Pagoy. Lambatak attacks. One-hander is gone from the short corner. Quality shots here. Pretty much the entire game. The offensive flow just is not there. Pogoy has to put up a tough three. He banks it home. Now it's a big defending Polic. So they go to put Dominic on the attack and scoring against a smaller defense of 9 minutes. No one playing over 33 minutes. That's a quick shot coming from Noo and a quick attack. They will tag you with one dice at the end of the elimination round and Kosant will play into factor guaranteed. Imagine the difference. They put in the work in Laguna at the Inspire facilities, but it's different when you've actually played two games already here in the Philippine Cup. You know, you were met by the San Miguel Beerman early in your first game. Took the loss and then the schedule favors you a little bit to get as you only have a minute 15 seconds to play here. Simon and Seesaw gets the layup. Getting reacquainted. Well, getting acquainted with a bunch of new teammates now. If you want to choose a player who started it all, it's Cyrus Torres. Yes, you can go bio. Choose the numbers. Sure. Double double for JB Bajio. And that will be the end of this ball game. Big win. An important width for the Enlex Road Warriors.",1,The video transcript provided is a straightforward commentary on a basketball game

incredible food the best sunsets we've ever seen one of the Seven Wonders of the World and so much vibrant energy we spent 5 days exploring Rio and we're going to show you all the best things to do and exactly how much to budget for this trip stay tuned what's up explorers welcome back to our Channel we're the choose here from choose to explore where we teach you guys how to world and save a dollar so we are here in beautiful Brazil yes none other than Rio de Janeiro and we're super excited cuz this is a place that we've always wanted to visit for such a very long time but it's so far away and the flights are super expensive but we got lucky and we found an abanka flight sale for $431 per person so we jumped on that deal and now we're here New York to Rio De Janeiro so we came here during March 2024 so there were no visa requirements but starting next month there will be visa requirements for Americans and we have all that included in our Brazil guide Linked In the description below so one of the best things about Rio is that Uber is widely available and it is very affordable so right from the airport we took a uber from the airport to our accommodation and it was about 98 R which is more or less $20 and it was like an hourong Drive which is a great price cuz in New York you drive for 5 minutes and it's $20 so um unfortunately we got here so early early that we couldn't check into our Airbnb yet but our host is really nice and she let us leave our bags so we're ready to get out and explore Rio de Janeiro so from our Airbnb we walked about 20 minutes down by the water um and pass by Leblon Beach it's a beautiful beach there lots of people it's beautiful temperature right now as well I hope it doesn't get much hotter than this but I really love the streets they have Mosaic tiles and it's just to see and after that we ended up at Zona aul now zon aul is actually a supermarket but they have a lot of self-service options and a lot of food so we went here and Liv got a mushroom pizza and I got a salami Panini and it was good lots of flavor we also got a coconut water because we're getting into some Adventures today so we got to stay hydrated all together was about 42 r [Music] so we just took a uber it was about 30 minutes and we are here at the national park of Tia and it's a beautiful Green Space it's actually west of Rio De Janeiro but it's beautiful over here and we're going to do a little hike right baby hike a baby hike so stay tuned and come along with [Music] us we made it here at casatina T I think that's how you say it it's a beautiful waterfall fall and what's really cool about it is it Cascades all the way down some rocks and to get to see the beautiful view you have this tunnel that you can go right through and it's just amazing here not too many people's fresh water so definitely come check this one out right here in tahuka National Park tzuka National Park [Music] all right so we climbed up some crazy mountains through garbage cans and people on motorbikes but we made it here at Cafe eont but unfortunately it looks like between the hours of 1: and 2 they have like a lunch break where they don't serve food but Liv was tired so she wanted to get a coffee so we came to get a coffee but we're really here for the views it has spectacular views looking out into the different rock formations the different beaches and it's just a really cool Vibe and aesthetic so I highly recommend coming here [Music] it took about a 30-minute Uber from our place to get us to Prior verela so from the time that we got there to the time that we made it up top was only 15 minutes which is what really accelerated that process is we bought our tickets online beforehand and that allowed us to bypass a lot of people and just go right up to the mountain yes no no waiting in lines so getting up in the cable cars there were so many people packed up in that little box but it definitely felt safe and it was a cool ride it was quick too I would say less than like 3 minutes yeah it was very short I felt um but now we're up here and I saw a monkey I think it's a monkey that I've never seen before I've never seen animal like that it was calm it didn't attack anybody so that's good but don't feed the monkeys there's signs about [Music] that all right so we thought we were all the way up at Sugarloaf Mountain but we weren't there's actually another cable ride that you got to take up here and it's perfect because it gives me more time on the cable ride um it's a beautiful another quick ride and up here is even higher even better views the Sun is setting over the mountains behind and I just can't take in all the beauty here in Brazil Rio de Jan so nice [Music] all right so right after seeing Sugarloaf Mountain on the cable car we were hungry so we headed over to Yaya's restaurant and it was really close by and it was so good so it's a black woman-owned restaurant right here in Brazil and it has a lot of black Brazilian Cuisine and flavors and these are some complex flavors we started off with drinks and I got a coconut lemonade and it was great yes and my drink was actually pineapple with some chamomile and it was really good so for starters we had the akaji platter and it was really good um it had shrimp it had fritters and it was so flavorful and we decided to share another shrimp dish you know live only shrimp or rice and it was good because it had so much flavor so it had rice and she says it's her favorite rice it was like really large grained rice and it was so good just on its own but then adding the shrimp was really good and then it was like a shrimp stew and then also there was cassava powder yeah crust right uh asaba flour yeah and just I highly recommended lot of really good food here yes good flavors good texture good good place to go good morning good morning another beautiful day here in Rio De Janeiro Brazil as you can see it is quite early the sun is not even risen because we are getting up to see one of the best places for sunrise in all of Rio so stay tuned you don't want to miss this one guys let's go 4:30 [Music] all right so we're here literally the only light that's here are these flashlights it's still 5:30 in the morning the sun has not risen yet but we are heading up to go see the beautiful view so stay with us guys let's hope that we capture these amazing views all right so we made it here as you can see the sun is rising and there are so many beautiful views but there are a lot of people a lot of photographers here trying to direct people but I don't care I'm going to get the picture I want and I don't care who tells me cuz honestly I don't speak Portuguese so I don't know what they saying anyway but spectacular views here right so we walked over to the other side of the parking lot to the helicopter pad section there's a lot less people here and it's a really great spot to just get some Drone footage and you can also even see Christ the Redeemer from here literally one of the most beautiful sunrises that I've ever seen with the mountains the Lakes the sun peeking through Rio is beautiful if you like more details on morante Dona Mara I have an entire blog post on chp.com so check it [Music] [Music] out let me tell you how amazing the people here in Brazil are so we were at mirante and we were trying to get down to the Christ the Redeemer trable car area but the Ubers were so far away they were like 15 minutes away and we were trying to get here for 7:00 to be one of the first people to that c the Redeemer but we couldn't get a ride but amazing people here in the parking lot we talked to these people in our broken portuguese translator and they took us here and we tried to give them money but they didn't even want it but now we meet it here at Paneras there corcovado and it's a little bit before 7:00 there is a line here but let's see if we can be one of the only people first people at Christ the [Music] Redeemer so it is currently 7:31 and we are in the 7:00 boarding group and they are just now letting us enter um so let's see what time we actually get up there but [Music] yeah all right so we made it here to one of the seven wers of the world we're on the second bus to get here to Christ the Redeemer and it has incredible views so many amazing views the Sun is up now but there's also so many people even though we were there on the second bus so this is also the perfect place for any special moment or activity you have for example this guy just proposed his fiance now at the Christ of Redeemer and it was great to see it right behind Rio and Christ the Redeemer so one thing that really is cool is in the place of Christ the Redeemer was supposed to be the lady who abolished slavery in Brazil but she said no I'm not the Redeemer of men Jesus Christ is the Redeemer of men and that is why Christ the Redeemer is on top of this hill for the most beautiful panoramic views in the [Music] city all right so just 15 minutes away from Christ redeemer is Plage Cafe and so we got here right at 9:00 when they open up and everyone was waiting in line to take a great picture so we did the same and after we got our photos in we came to sit and eat and have breakfast so let's see how it is honestly if you guys can see my head right now it is hot in we've been up since 4:30 in the morning and it wasn't so cool um hot but now I am baking fet M right now all right so I just finished eating at PL Cafe I ended up getting the vegetarian lasagna and it was pretty good I don't know why I thought there was going to be noodles in it it was just eggplant but it was really good really good cheese and I enjoyed it but once you leave the cafe and you start walking they have this beautiful garden and they have these amazing trees I originally thought that they were palm trees but when I look up I see a bunch of monkeys up top coming to eat the food but not just that they have the o o I forget the name of the fruit but in Jamaica we just called them apples but they have these beautiful fruit and I wish I could get them but the monkeys are hogging all of them all right so it's midday now about like 12:00 and we walk down right from our Airbnb and we're at prior de Leblon which is Leblon Beach and what's good y' and let's just say it is active out here there are so many people and they all have their own beach umbrellas they are enjoying and having a good time so we got to get it in [Music] too all right so we're in Brazil so you know we have to get really good assai so we went to ASA which is Amazon sustainable action asai and Liv got the what I got the pure asai bowl and it was really good it's really cool because you just go up to the kiosk and add what you want to your asai bowl I got half asai half kopu I think it's called but listen it is so good it's Amazonian super fruit and I highly recommend it guys it's the Koop the I'm Sor Koopa wazu I think get that one get that one it's so good all right so we're walking back to our Airbnb and what I will say Brazilians are beautiful fit people listen I thought I'd look good with my shirt off but I just seen a couple wom with a six-pack on their upper back and their lower back so I don't I can't compare with that everybody works out here 18 pack versus my six-pack ain't it all right so we were just walking back home and right there on the beach we saw this charismatic guy making drinks so you know we had to get one we got a national drink of Brazil which is the caparini and it's so good it's lime it's rum sugar so much good flavor and I don't drink but I got the coconut lots of flavor and hers was only 20 R and mine was only 9 R yes right by Le blond [Music] be so we went to this place called B the Arda I think that's what it's called but but um it was really good I got a Brazilian dish which is Escondido I think it's called it was really good it had like pulled meat it had mashed potatoes uh parmesan it was lots of flavor in there I highly recommend it it was a shepherd's pie that he got and I got um it's something that reminded me of a pastei from Aruba oh yeah but um it was actually something called of the Gods and it had um it was filled with two kinds of cheeses no like four it was like an Bri gorgona and something else but it was all really [Music] good all right and we made it to Epona right before the sunset if you can see that over there it's sunsets right over the mountains and it's a beautiful view iima is definitely another Beach right next to leblan but this beach honestly is a lot prettier it looks prettier there's a lot more tourists that are here and there's a lot more vendors so this is a lot of things catching my eye I need to buy I got to get away we walked all the way on the boardwalk and we made it here to these rocks where it has an amazing view of the sunset right over the rocks in Rio de Janeiro I absolutely love this this is definitely the best place that I've seen for a sunset so a really good thing about this beach is that you don't even have to go anywhere all the people come to you with their drinks with their food they'll come and serve it right [Music] right for dinner here we ended up at brto cuz I really wanted to get good Brazilian steak and we walked all the way up Copa Cabana Beach and it's another beautiful beach here and we made it here so I got the steak with fries eggs rice and it was great it was a picana steak and lots of flavor here live God a banana Fritter she says it kind of reminded her of Auntie Anne's pretel if you know you know but all together was about a 100 R so about $20 for the two of us for dinner so pretty good price now we're going to head back home good morning good morning another beautiful day here in Rio de Janeiro so we got woken up to this beautiful sound of the Waves Bond and we are heading to get the day started the people here are so friendly um and yeah it's like 5:55 about to be 6:00 but you know we got to be early we got to start our days early cuz you know choose to explore we always choose to explore we got things to [Music] do we made it here it's around 6:30 in the morning and it's just us and one other group here to take pictures so it's good it's beautiful and you can live out your dream of being the video vixen and the Beautiful video not a vix [Music] all right so these steps were designed by sailor on who was fixing his stairs in front of his house there's over 200 stairs and there's over 2,000 tiles now and people from all over the world start contributing to the tiles and the Ceramics and it's really cool to see so many bright beautiful colors beautiful tiles from all over the world [Music] all right if you want more information on the Sailor Ro steps check out chp.com I have an entire blog post on it all right so right after we left the steps we went right across the street to this restaurant and we had some delicious delicious asai nice and refreshing what while we're sitting here and we're watching all the people coming in and out come early because there are so many people here and it's only 8:00 right now the vendors are coming out it's good to support the local economy so definitely come and support [Music] them so from escadia Saron we walked up the hill let may say it was a mountain it was a mountain in order to get us straight vertical mountain in order for us to get here to park the that's ruinas which is a super cool ruined mansion with a really nice art gallery but the even though it was a long walk it's on Google Maps it says it's going to take 12 minutes but with stops it probably took us like 30 minutes right take an Uber okay don't walk just take an Uber well we're here it's beautiful and this has one of the most beautiful views of Sugarloaf Mountain where we were on our first day so definitely would recommend it it also has like a look like a concert hall different women's shops and market so highly recommend coming here lons of souvenirs you can buy and I'm just going to relax for [Music] now so we just took a uber from the ruins Park and we pulled up to the BM Jim I apologize Portuguese is very hard for me to pronounce but I really love this spot it's very affordable they have promotions that are Monday through Sunday so I ended up getting this fried fish and it was phenomenal broccoli rice and mashed potatoes and I am so full right now and it's a great breakfast Choice yeah I actually got broccoli rice as well and some beans with kava flour and like AO almost it was really good and also some juice highly recommend it [Music] guys all right so next up we went to sterer Cafe and I got a really good latte with oat milk and then as afterwards we walk towards U Museum Joe ammana which is like the Museum of tomorrow and it's really cool here they have a lot of shops lined up it's right by the ocean so there's tons of beautiful water boats here so I really like it this area kind of reminds me of like a European area it looks a lot different than the other parts in Rio that we've been to which is cool but I had to get my $2 assai right from the street cards very good and listen everybody here takes card even the street cards so now we're here at the Museum deam Mano and let's [Music] enter so I'm out here in Brazil listen my god listen this New York connection right here how things happen it's funny how things my first day I actually my controller broke and my man is out here so I had to link up with him I had to get the controller so you're a fool if you don't ask people when you have connections you're a fool so he showed me love he brought the controller and we got to chop it up listen the first time we ever link is in Rio Brazil it's not even in New York it's in Brazil so appreciate you my brother no doubt anytime so here on Coba Cabana Beach on Sundays they actually block off this whole road so only pedestrians can go this way so definitely a cool place to be to watch people and just enjoy over here right yeah soopa Cabana is a beautiful beach it's a beach that I've heard about since I was a kid so I'm so happy to finally be here but the sand is super soft white sand there's a lot of people with umbrellas and beach chairs and it's just a great place to be at the beach Liv got her 75th cup of assai right yeah it's really good but definitely come to the beach together because it's the cheapest yet at the beach this one was not even $2 for this cup and it had oats and all of that as well so on the beach we keep seeing these different corn stands and a lot of people eating them and getting them and I was like who wants hot corn and it's 96° outside but I decided to stop and get it I think it's called Milo Verde and this is very good they get the corn in the cob they cut it off and then they give you different uh toppings with garlic salt butter really good I highly recommend it and it's only 10 R which is like $2 [Music] really big time the [Music] be good morning good morning another beautiful day here in Rio and it's a lot brighter than it usually is and we say good morning because I let the queen sleep in you know we slept in like 8:00 you know that's sleeping in for us but we're ready to get this day started we're going to get some breakfast and still got a lot more to do so for breakfast we walked to BB lanches which is right here in the leblan area um Liv had to get her favorite CUA soup her 16th one I got the pineapple with the mint in it I love this one as well we also got the Brazilian cheese bread called po de kesu I highly recommend getting that and also some different breakfast pastries I really enjoy it and it's inexpensive all together this was like 30 R which is like $6 for breakfast we stopped at new Cafe which is right by Leblon Beach and it's a really cute little cafe it's similar to somewhere in Bali all the Aesthetics I ordered a really great dish I got the uh sourdough toast with avocado and tomatoes and must mushrooms and it was so good I also got a cappuccino with um almond milk and then what did you get I got the papaya fruit bowl and it was actually papay with granolas kiwis blueberri strawberries and really good all together this was about 85 R which is really good so then we took an hourong ride from Rio all the way to Pedra de telegrafo which is a far ride it was only about 80 R again which is good price for how far away it is from there you could take a motorbike up about 20 minutes it saves you a lot of time when you're walking but we decided to walk up um The Walk was pretty easy we just followed Google Maps and went around to the trail head and now we have about 30 more minutes up to the Rock in the Viewpoint it's not a choose to explore destination without hiking so you ready my love we got the energy from breakfast so she says also it'll bring bug spray so oh and water you're not going to make without [Music] water so it took us about an hour from the bottom all the way to the top but we made it here and it's a beautiful Viewpoint here now the reason why everybody comes here is because of the effect it looks like you're hanging off the edge of a cliff but really there's a rock underneath you so it's definitely safe you will get a little scared when you get there cuz just from how high it is but we waited in line to take the photos it took us about 30 minute weight because everybody comes and they take like 10 minutes each photo which is crazy but I mean you deserve it you did this long hike and you made it to this Viewpoint so get your Pi in um there is a guy up here that will uh take your photos for you for five real which is like $1 per photo so you guys can do that if you want really good pictures as [Music] well all right so while we were in line waiting to take our picture at Cafe Plage the lady in front of us was really nice and she was showing us all these really beautiful pictures of like really nice water and telling us exactly where to go to find it and she actually typed it into our phone and everything so we saved it on our map it was ilad do giio so we just just went there and um I don't think it was the same place that she meant to take us to so it was um we really just took a short boat ride like 1 minute across the water and we ate at a restaurant called Akbar at akbar's restaurant and it was okay and then afterwards my food was phenomenal I got this the mix skewers the chicken with the bacon I got the um Carnet y listen mine was really good mine was okay I had the shrimp Bobo but the shrimp Bobo that I had at Yaya was like phenomenal so it didn't really compare to that one um and then afterwards we had some gelato right up the street and that was pretty good it was self-served gelato and now we walked a little bit further up the street from where the boat L us off and now we're at PRI deara deuka I'm sorry it's on the screen so this is a really nice Beach uh the water looks nicer than the water that we saw at the other beaches so far in Rio so this is a really nice relaxing time that we're having and not just that it's a lot less people here as well yeah [Music] all right so we're here at Pedro D on a Monday night and if you know anything about this area it's where they have the block party every single Monday after 8:00 so right here it's so many people it's so Lively here they play Ensemble music they're dancing they have a bunch of drinks a bunch of food and what really surprises me is everybody still takes cars even though there's like different stalls it's really cool it's a real good vibe You Can Dance you can drink you can just have a good time so every Monday come to the parties at Pedro [Music] doal good morning good morning it's our last and final day here in Rio and we got up early took uh Uber to the airport and it only took about 25 minutes which is fantastic and Uber only cost around $14 which is also fantastic and we made it here at the Rio de Janeiro airport so we had an amazing time in Rio and you can't wait to get back here there's so much more to explore in the gigantic country of Brazil and we haven't even scratched the surface yeah so if you

Zealand is heaven on Earth this country is one of the most remote places on our planet but is home to the most breathtaking Landscapes that look like they were made with AI from pristine freshwater legs with fiords towering snowcapped mountain ranges and picturesque roads where you feel like you're in a dream New Zealand is known for having one of the highest qualities of life more sheep than people and filled with activities that will get your heart racing Welcome To Heaven on Earth so welcome to the beautiful land of New Zealand New Zealand has been at the top of my bucket list for so long but I feel like I've kept pushing it off because it takes so long to get here it is about an 18-hour flight as well as an 18-hour time change now the one thing I have not been looking forward to with this trip is how here in New Zealand they drive on the left side of the road and the driver is on the right side of the car I have never done that before in my life so hopefully we get around this island safely stay on the left side all right we're ready so another weird thing is I keep going to hit my blinker but it's the windshield wiper it's on the opposite side and then also to go into reverse you have to do it Lefty so driving here it's almost like you're driving with one eye open and in a reverse mirror everything is backwards and flipped it's so weird also with me as my co- captain on this adventure we got Chris what's going on y'all taking over while Brett focuses on the road real quick we keep saying that this place feels like a movie everywhere you go and that's actually kind of one of the first things we have coming up we'll check back with you once we make it there safely got you oh [Music] so New Zealand is one of those places that is so beautiful that it makes you feel like you teleported inside of a fairy tale or quite literally this is where they filmed one of the most iconic movie series of all time here at the hobbiton movie [Music] Set so we just learned something super fascinating where it took them 18 months to build this entire set where then they shot everything in 12 days and was only 7 Minutes in the movie and they only filmed for 7 minutes because hate to break it to you guys this hobbit hole is actually a facade where if you go in here you just have this empty wooden Hut so with a little movie Magic when they have the actor go into The Hobbit Hole they're actually going into a different set down in Wellington still really cool though so in the beginning of the movie Frodo runs through this path right here and screams I'm going on an adventure probably one of the best scenes in the entire movie we're going to recreate it okay Chris yep I'm going on an adventure next movie starring Brett KY that was my audition tape Brett baggin I like that now while The Hobbit homes were man-made this unique landscape was not even if you were not a fan of the movie series exploring hobbiton is truly a magical experience which does make sense why it is one of the most visited places in the entire country but I'd say is totally worth it so New Zealand is the country where Mother Nature just loves to show off since right in front of me right here is the world's highest commercially graded waterfall it is a Class 5 and by far the highest most powerful waterfall I've ever seen in real life and also what we are about to be rafting Down Chris you fired up for this I'm fired up I'm like you saying that makes me feel like oh my God I'm going to put Chris on blast Chris has been so nervous about this the whole trip when I woke up I'm like oh man it's here nothing can prepare you for The Rush you're about to happen let's do this brother [Applause] [Music] yeah yeah that was pretty [Music] swe what are the chances of flipping I don't we do we done put your pedals up in the middle my all right to get down oh my God we got this Chris let's [Music] go how's that incredible let's do that again does it not always go that smoothly I did a front flip for my last trip oh my God that would have been fun it was fun for me not for anyone [Music] else guys so that white water rting experience was incredible if you are an adrenaline junkie you must come here to New Zealand and do that we did it with ro road rafting and they did such an incredible job keeping us safe but also making sure we had a the thrill of a ride and now the thing Chris and I have been looking forward to most about this trip we have done a lot of ridiculous things on our travels but this one might be the most ridiculous we are driving a total of 10 hours today to go to the city that has the world's longest name literally has a Guinness World Record for it what is the name what is the name it is thankfully my buddy raw who is a local here in New Zealand has a song where he says the name like five times so for these next 5 hours of driving we're going to listen to that song on repeat and hopefully by the time we get there we'll be masters of saying this name let this adventure begin woo busy through the all day sign walk the coast in a single run hit the road share the load with discovering Lo up oh my gosh this is what we just drove 3 and 1/2 hours here where we're going to have to drive 6 and 1/2 hours after this and it's totally worth it the longest name of a place in the entire world is right here [Music] so I'm all about doing things for my life resume but never did I think I would put on it going to the place with the world's longest name and we made it all the way here where it is kind of just a sign I do have to give credit when credit is due Chris this was your findings and put it on the list of things we had to see basically saw a Tik Tok video and I ran it by you with no context I was just like bro look at this video and you just looked at me in the dead in the eye and you're like we got to go I'm a man of my word and we made it to ready ready k m Bang fck if you guys do plan on making the track all the way out here I do highly recommend checking the weather right fine and sunny weather [Music] so if you want to travel New Zealand you are definitely going to be driving a lot so we made sure to pin some really cool spots that we wanted to hit with one of them being here in the famous surf town of Ragin so if you guys do have the time highly recommend stopping here for a bite to eat and for a surf Raglin is actually a renowned surf spot since it has one of the longest left breaks in the world you can ride a wave for what feels like minutes so after getting to explore the town of Raglin and the incredible surf we got on a quick flight from the north island off to Christ Church in the South Island [Music] [Music] so we just made here to Lake teapo and I must say this place truly is heaven on Earth and I am already so impressed from the north islands but I know that people say the real crown jewel of New Zealand is here in the South Islands because of its beauty nature and adventure and one of the main reasons I was so excited to come here to New Zealand was because my grandfather was a world Traveler and out of all the places he's been he said that you have not lived until you come here to New Zealand so man it really just is a dream come true so excited to be here in New Zealand so as you guys can see New Zealand is absolutely beautiful but I must say the beauty does come with a price so if you are traveling here I do highly recommend Packaging everything together with xedia since on Expedia you can book your flights your rental car your activities your stays everything all in one place and when you do package things together on Expedia it does give you discounts and makes it overall significantly cheaper also I am very excited to say that Expedia gave me my own discount code which is just Brett at checkout and you will get 5% off all eligible stays and all of you can use that discount code for properties all around the world but if you guys do want to see the specific hotels I stayed at here in New Zealand I will leave a link to my Expedia Travel Shop down below I have places from $70 a night all the way up to around [Music] 250 oh my gosh guys this has by far been the most incredible drive that we've had yet here in New Zealand and it's been very moody and cloudy for most of it but as of right now the clouds just let the mountains peek through and you can see the top of Mount Cook Mother Nature is just showing off for us right now wow so today we are doing the hookers Peak Trek which is about a 3M Trail one way and already being just 5 minutes in it is absolutely incredible like just check out this suspension bridge over this crystal clear blue water with this unbelievable view like come on guys how is this even real life and there is Chris being as lit as ever a lot of you guys might think that I hire Chris to come with me cuz he's good with the camera that's just a A plus it's really just because he keeps me very entertained [Music] so we made it here to the hooker Lake which I didn't know that the reward that you get the payoff is a 3° Iceberg cold lunch honestly pretty good for me it's not so good for Chris let's go Florida boy all right so we met a new friend Nikki from Australia we're going to dive in now you guys Ready's three two one woo oh yeah nice and cold so the reason why this water is so blue and also so cold is because it is glacier water as you can see there is glaciers that are melting and it's just flowing rushing down the mountain into this Lake right here in New Zealand I would have to describe as just being so clean and so pure If Heaven looks as good as this I'm going to be quite happy and you will have gotten a preview this is the preview to have it yeah this is the pre and you got a little [Music] preview after clocking dozens of hours of driving I would say the hardest part of the drives has been trying to not stop every 5 minutes to take in the views and after a very successful first day in the South Island I was very very excited to see what tomorrow would bring so something new that I learned about here in New Zealand is that there is actually something called the Southern Lights similar to the Northern Lights where you have the crazy green aora you have that here in the Southern Hemisphere and unfortunately we have not gone to see that yet but Chris over here did wake up in the middle of the night got a dope night laps yeah thing is that I had to stay up so late is because I had to wait for the moon to set if the moon is out you don't see the stars like off camera it came out all right it was my first time doing in a couple years but even just like looking up at the night sky I promise you it's one of the most beautiful things you'll ever see yeah shout out to Chris for that not going to lie your boy was sleeping like a baby yeah you were and that is cuz today we have our biggest hike yet ahead of us let's head out to Roy's Peak Road Trip [Music] so after a 2 and a half beautiful drive we made it here to the town of wanka to do the famous Roy Peak Roy Peak is one of the most iconic views in all the south island of New Zealand and is a pretty Advanced hike we met a couple hikers that said it took them about 6 hours and was pretty intense so Chris let this 6-hour adventure begin bro back to back days of hiking we've got about 10 m round trip and apparently like 1,300 MERS in elevation I don't even know what that conversion is but it sounds like a lot so yeah even just looking at it right now looks pretty darn steep to me but I've got the tunes to get us through [Music] ready also a side note this is very unintentional but we're like both kind of matching right now so we look like we look like we're on like The Amazing Race or [Music] something checking in about 3 hours later and 5 miles later and we are really in one of the most beautiful places on this planet I can see the top of the summit right over Yonder and it looks so close but still got a bit of a waste to go 1 hour later and we made it give me a hand final step come on [Music] [Applause] [Music] so the hike was pretty intense but I would say the average person and even the average sheep could do it so I was like for you guys it wasn't too bad overall though hike was amazing definitely one of the best views I've ever had on a hike and if you look back you can see all of the switchbacks and how intense this hike actually is so we went all the way down every single one of those roads and then the car park which is all the way down there now time to go all the way back down [Music] [Applause] [Music] if you guys are into road trips then New Zealand is definitely the place for you we are currently on a 2-hour adventure to Milford Sound but the entire drive has just been absolutely beautiful we are honestly just up in the mountains in the clouds in the sky and through the rivers such a magical place so we just took a quick stop to check the tire pressure AKA take a leak but just check out how beautiful this place is guys definitely top five places I've ever taken a leak for real though this is just heaven on Earth [Music] so just when I thought New Zealand couldn't get any more beautiful we just made here to the Milford sounds as we're going through the fiords on this cruise ship where we've already got to see seals Dolphins waterfalls this Crystal Blue Water from the glaciers and just honestly one of the most majestic places I've ever seen out of any country so what makes Milford Sound and all of New Zealand so magnificent is that it all starts with the air because of New Zealand's isolated location it re receives some of the purest air on the planet from there clean air transcends to clean rain clean crops healthy livestock to clean food which is why New Zealand and its people have one of the highest qualities of life on Earth and it all circles back to clean air so much that there is a company that literally harnesses the air puts it in a can and is bought by people who live in highly polluted areas this Milford Sound experience is a little bit far to get to but should definitely not be missed if you're in New Zealand the cruise itself was about $90 that I will leave a link to book on Expedia down [Music] below so we have finally made it to the last destination of this 2E Adventure here in Queenstown and I must say it is so nice to be in a place like Queenstown which is a proper City since we have just been staying in all these tiny little Villages for the past 2 weeks like especially staying in places like T [ __ ] and here in Queenstown we are staying in this incredible property let me show [Music] you so we are staying here at the Sherwood which has felt like a fullon wellness retreat they have a sauna co-working spaces and even a garden where they grow a lot of the ingredients for their incredible restaurants so if you guys are coming here to Queenstown this is a great option and at a good price point so I will leave a link down below to the Expedia booking for the Sherwood where you can also use discount code Brett for 5% [Music] off also Queenstown is like the adventure capital of the world

Fuji just 3 hours from Tokyo both okanawa Island itself and its capital city naha cater to a Japanese itinerary wanting something different not only because of its historic Castle grounds relaxing bike rides around nearby islands and one of the largest aquariums in the world but because everything here has its own Oka nowan flare and we love it Japanese shops are lined with palm trees their best local dishes have so many surprising twists and there's also an American village a bizarrely themed experience we'll explain later so if you think you know Japan this video should present you with yet another side along with chiaki who's from Japan we make travel movies from around the world hoping you might just find your next holiday inspiration this is suitcase monkey with a suggested trip over 4 days around naha [Music] Okinawa for the best introduction to naha and Okinawa in general look no further than coxide Dory stretching 2 km this High Street is unlike any other in Japan and that's not just because you can be served coffee by this no faced monster which is either the most endearing business idea ever or the most concerning instead this road is unique because of the surprising number of okan influences that sit proudly on its sleeve from signs of the locally produced Orion beer to okan mythology to the insane amount of spam merchandise everywhere and we will explain why later to the wide selection of glass wear and pottery yet another Regional skill in fact just a short walk from covid Dori is the subya district a quaint cobbled neighborhood that dedicates itself to these locally produced Ceramics and is well worth the short walk for a potential souvenir looking back though over all our lunches and dinners we had during our entire month in Japan some of our best dishes were around coxide Dori with the restaurants all falling under three distinct categories first you'll find numerous diners featuring live okan music most easily described as Japanese folk it has a very distinct sound and it was here where I not only enjoyed my first chero a local stir fry favorite but also a single glass of this habushu or under its other name snake wine adding further to the unique nature of walking around coxide Dori you you'll frequently see these coiled up snakes and it all comes back to this drink dating back to 14th century okanawa these vipers are placed in jars of herbs and honey with the added alcohol dissolving their venom over time this reptile Association gave it the marketing position as a sort of libido boosting energy drink much like a better version of prime today only without the poison [Music] the second category of Diner here was usually one or two streets removed from coxide Dori these would feel a lot less touristy typically sharing a collection of plates some with no spoken English at all but some with an English menu and if you are wondering I too have heard really good things about the as chicken it is very eggy that [Music] but out of all of these our favorite was probably suumo I'll link our other preferred restaurants and hotel that we stayed in the description down below with all attractions featured in this video on one free downloadable PDF guide the last category of Dino we enjoyed in naha were all found inside this one building a massive food court where you could spend half an hour are just trying to pick your favorite the two times we ate here both restaurants had a QR code to order through your phone which also translated to English when trying to choose something we experienced a bunch of times over our final few weeks in [Music] Japan we ended our first night with a couple of drinks at this cozy Jazz barar and then headed back to our hotel sitting on the far end of coxide Dori the room was pretty standard for Japan but perfect for its location with a mini kitchenet and much needed clothes washer dryer again all details are linked below tomorrow we' be exploring further north taking a popular day trip that would share some of the best highlights around the entire [Music] Island for those unaware our time in okanawa was part of a 3-month trip around Asia and for every

QR code for wherever you're traveling to next and get a 10% discount whenever you add the code suitcase monkey [Music] over the course of 9 hours our Island Tour would take in five different stops ranging from 20 minutes to 2 hours each it's the easiest way to get a taste beyond the capital but you could also consider renting a car over a couple of days for those wanting to take things a slower Pace we were traveling in late January so all of this is their wintertime with temperatures ranging from 17 to [Music] 25° situated on the west coast and 90 minutes from naha is the most visited attraction in all of Okinawa the chami aquarium once the largest in the world it's still considered Japan's best and is well worth a couple of hours to explore presenting all of ainow sea life it begins with all the usual exhibits you'd expect from any aquarium that is until you reach its most iconic room [Music] [Music] [Music] the part of today I was certainly most curious about was its finale on first glance the American village feels like a bizarre Japanese attempt to recreate the United States and if military clothing the Cheers Bar the hometown of Aladdin possibly whoever this guy is and pink skyscrapers doesn't scream America to you then I don't know what will I do have to admit though once the Power of Love belted out across speakers around the village even I got into it and started walking like an American this is how they walk isn't it the background to the American village though is once again another okan surprise after World War II okanawa was under administrative Us control for almost 30 years and it was during this time the region was heavily influenced by American culture and this is where okawa's love for spam originates since the can meet was a popular food ration for US soldiers it was then passed on Via the military as an affordable meal for a rebuilding nation and even still today owans consume 7 million tins of spam every single year and it all dates back to this post-war era and so after okena was handed back to Japan in 72 the local authorities built an American themed Village partly to Kickstart their economy with tourism but also to provide a familiar spot for the local military bases although this all initially seemed like a bizarre idea by the time we needed to leave I kind of wanted to stay just a little longer tomorrow would be another early wakeup and for the first time we'd be stepping foot off okanawa Island and visiting somewhere a little more peaceful [Music] zamami island is a short 50-minute high-speed ferry from nahar's tamari Port during the summer months it's most visited for its beaches snorkeling and scuba Dives with January to March best for whale watching or simply those wanting a peaceful Island Escape with a population of less than 1,000 it has a very relaxed small town feel the nice man who cooked our lunch for example was also the same nice man who helped us board the ferry this calming under developed nature quickly rubs off a new and it's enjoyable just breathing in the fresh air after talking with staff at The Visitors Center they suggested a bike rental service a short walkway which was essentially just someone's back gate with an attached honesty box what we hadn't realized is that by visiting at the end of January even though it was a pleasant 23° we pretty much had the entire Island to ourselves [Music] taking the first and last high-speed Ferry means you only get about 6 hours for a day trip here but that probably is enough these winter months may not offer much for some people but this day still sits as one of my favorite okan hour memories especially after getting this surprise sighting [Music] [Music] our last day would be exploring three different areas just a short monreal or bus ride away from downtown naha chury Castle is a former Royal Palace dating back 700 years making it the most visited historic site on the island this neighboring District was previously the political capital of Okinawa or as it was known then the ryuku kingdom ruling for 450 years unfortunately due to a devastating fire in 2019 the castle is currently undergoing heavy reconstruction estimated for a 2026 completion you do have to admire their effort for turning the rebuilding process into part of its story making the Regeneration a display in itself but it does obviously impact the overall experience in the meantime I still think it's worth a it if you have the time though especially when its neighborhood is still enjoyable for an aimless wonderand [Music] traveling to the south side of the island we next made a trip to Umi Kaji Terrace probably the most unique food court I've ever witnessed a trendy complex split over four stories it boasts more than 40 Restaurants cafes and boutiques all of which give you a stunning front row seat to the naha international airport now I've never been much of a flying nerd but it turns out there is something surprisingly enjoyable about hunting for an appropriate food snack around this Terrace and then Watching airplanes land over the seas in front [Music] this okan taco rice serving was an unexpected tasty Fusion of Japanese Cuisine and Tech Mech yet another American influence mixing rice and omelette with beef tacos Jacki also really loved this super fresh seafood restaurant especially this tuna served here with a side serving of II budo yet another local speciality it's otherwise known as sea grapes and they're actually a type of seaweed with a subtly sweet but crispy taste the last Ace the Umi Kaji Terrace has up its sleeves though are its Hot Springs if you really want to spoil yourselves then the riin hot springs bath house is definitely worth a visit but due to time we instead opted for this free faster foot bath if you are daunted by showing another Japanese man your meat and to Edge this is probably your next best bet that is if you can ignore the waiting taxi drivers in front and the sound of booming Jets [Music] our final stop for the day then was back near a coxide Dori the Okinawa museum is the best place for those wanting to learn more about the fascinating lesser known history for these islands although it was admittedly a little shall we say Japanese in its execution firstly it's important to note that along with photography pencils are allowed here which was certainly a weight of my mind after buying our tickets we walked around the first room and then quickly realized there must must be an audio guide that we missed on Entry so we went back to the museum entrance to inquire and were told to collect the audio guides from the library which I don't know why we didn't think of that the collection process then involved filling out a form for some reason and then you're handed this a large clipboard with an attached digital pencil which now made sense of this anywh who this pen attaches to a set of wired headphones and to select English you touch an American flag because they invented English after we got through all of this the system then worked as you'd expect with some interesting little known history around the ryuku kingdom the battle at ven hour and the island as of today in summary carrying a weighty clipboard around for an hour will give you arach and unfortunately the cable for the headphones isn't quite long enough so it kind of pulls at your head the whole time so yeah it's a good idea with some interesting history and questionable execution but for £ 270 it was fine I'll finish off this video with our robot waiter who seemed to be having a bit of a nervous twitch about him but I did see him snorting a Duracell in the back so if you have made it this far then I'm very sorry for you but do

We indulged in quality Korean   barbecue for just $10 we walk through majestic 
royal palaces just like a K-drama and we witnessed   breathtaking scenic landscape completely for free 
we are now here to give you the best and most   informative South Korea travel guide the internet 
has ever seen in this video we give you everything   you need to know the best places to visit the 
best things to do and the best food to eat all   so that you could have the best South Korea trip 
possible so let's go [Music] hi guys my name is   Angelica wanders and this is Aileen wanders and we 
create budget travel guides all around the world   on this channel we show you our easy to follow 
itineraries and also our costs and expenses in   every trip so if you want to travel around the 
world in the easiest and most affordable way   possible then hit that like button and hit that 
subscribe button because we make videos just for   you stick until the end of this video because 
we give you the ultimate 7-Day budget itinerary   and also a cost breakdown so you can get an idea 
of how much a first timer South Korea trip could   cost and without further Ado let's explore South 
Korea first off let's talk about how to get cheap   flights to so what we like to do is compare prices 
through platforms like Skyscanner and Google   flights you can compare prices out of the entire 
month and choose the cheapest date you can even   filter them out from the cheapest option or the 
fastest option basically being flexible with your   dates can really give you more affordable options 
and save you a good amount of money another tip   would be to stalk your local airlines daily follow 
them on social media subscribe to their email   lists just do anything to stay updated so you're 
ready to hop on to any sale personally we live in   the Philippines so we usually wait for piso sales 
from Cebu Pacific wherein a roundtrip promo flight   can cost as low as 4,000 to 6,000 pesos per head 
by the way if you guys want to learn our secrets   and strategies on how to book piso sale flights 
easily you can check out our piso sale tutorial   right here next up when is the best time to visit 
South Korea well that would depend on what colors   you're hoping to experience if you're after 
beautiful cherry blossoms and mild temperatures   it's best to visit during spring which runs 
from March to June here are the peak dates of   the spring blooming season for each region but 
if you're just staying within Seoul here are   the best places to see cherry blossoms within 
the city feel free to screenshot if you want   to witness the autumn foliage and cooler weather 
visit during the fall from September to November   here are some of the best places to spot beautiful 
autumn leaves in South Korea however both of these   seasons are quite popular so expect more crowds 
and higher prices but if you want to avoid the   peak season then winter from December to February 
might be ideal especially if you enjoy skiing and   want to witness snow covered landscapes plus 
you'll find fewer tourists and better deals on   accommodations okay so now that you booked your 
flight and finally arrived in Seoul every tourist   should pick up three things at the airport number 
one a pocket Wi-Fi before your trip to Seoul I   would highly suggest pre-booking a pocket Wi-Fi or 
a local sim so you have internet to navigate your   way around South Korea for short-term trips like 
5 to 7 days you can pre-book a pocket Wi-Fi which   costs as low as $2.30 per day but for longer term 
stays you can book a local SIM card for unlimited   data which costs $46 for 30 days make sure you 
pre-book these in advance to get the best prices   for the most reliable and affordable pocket Wi-Fi 
and SIM cards in South Korea I'll leave some of   the links in the description below then in order 
to claim it you just have to find their designated   counter at the airport and they will help set up 
your internet for you number two the second thing   to pick up at the airport is cash from our own 
experience we found that withdrawing money from   ATMs abroad usually offer better exchange rates as 
compared to money changers but don't worry about   withdrawing too much because throughout South 
Korea you can use your credit card for most   transactions however if you plan to explore street 
food or buy from smaller local shops this is when   cash will be most needed and number three don't 
forget to pick up a T-money card this reloadable   transit card is your key to getting around Seoul 
on public transportation it works for the subway   buses and even taxis across the city you can 
easily pick one up at any convenience store or   T-money vending machine right at the airport the 
card itself costs just 4,000 Won as a one-time   fee then simply load it up tap to ride and you're 
good to go literally and if you have any leftover   balance at the end of your trip you can get it 
refunded at any convenience store or train station   okay so now that you have everything you need 
at the airport it's time to head to your hotel   just a heads up Seoul is about an hour away from 
Incheon airport so here are the four main ways   to get into the city First Option you can take 
the airport railroad Express the RX train is a   fast budget friendly option that takes you 
directly from the airport to Seoul station   in just 45 minutes a one-way ticket costs about 
$7 one way which you can conveniently pay with   your T-money card at the airport station if 
you're looking to save even more money you   can opt for the slower all stop train which cost 
$3.50 to Seoul station but it has a lot of stops   along the way second option you can take the 
airport limousine bus these buses drop off at   various locations around Seoul with travel times 
of about 60 to 90 minutes depending on traffic and   your destination a one-way ticket cost $13 in my 
opinion these buses are actually more convenient   than the train since the train stations in Korea 
are massive and you'll end up doing a lot lot of   walking with your luggages whereas with the 
airport bus you can hop off at your nearest   bus stop and the third option would be to book a 
taxi or an Uber the priciest option but the most   convenient one a taxi ride from the airport to 
downtown Soul normally costs $50 to $70 one way   plus an additional 6 bucks for the Incheon toll 
fee but it will take you directly to your hotel   saving you a lot of hassle and lastly option 
four would be to book the late night bus keep   in mind that the airport train only operates 
from 5:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. and the airport   bus runs from 5:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. if your 
flight lands after midnight let's say around 2:   a.m. you can catch the late night bus however 
the late night bus only makes three stops in   Seoul so if you're not staying near any of these 
stops the easiest trick is just to hop off the   bus at Seoul station and book an Uber directly to 
your hotel from there it may take a little effort   in the middle of the night but it's still cheaper 
than taking a taxi directly from the airport okay   so now you're an expert on how to get to Seoul 
another important question is where is the best   place to stay in Seoul well for first timers there 
are four main areas to choose from Myeongdong   Hongdae Insadong or Gangnam so let me show you the 
differences between each one so it can help you   choose which is the best area for you let's begin 
first up Myeongdong Myeongdong is a shopper's   paradise and one of Seoul's most famous spots 
for vibrant nightlife picture streets lined with   endless cosmetic shops street food vendors and 
trendy dining options it's busy it's lively and   perfect for anyone who loves the hustle and bustle 
of the city plus it's super central making it easy   to reach other parts around Seoul accommodations 
range from budget to luxury so if you want to be   in the middle of the action and don't mind the 
city's energy Myeongdong is your best bet next we   have Hongdae if you're looking for Seoul's artsy 
hip and young vibe Hongdae is your spot known   for its music scene colorful murals and lively 
night life this area has everything from live   performances to trendy bars to super cool arcades 
this is where you'll find a lot of Gen-Zs due to   its proximity to universities which makes the area 
full of budget friendly eats and quirky cafes it's   perfect for travelers looking to experience the 
creative side of Seoul and dive into that edgy   Korean culture next up Insadong now if you're all 
about traditional Korean culture within the heart   of the city Insadong is your place think tea 
houses antique shops and streets lined up with   handcrafted souvenirs it's the perfect blend 
of modern and traditional where you can stroll   down cobbled lanes and find a handbook rental 
shop right next to an art gallery this area is   a bit quieter than Myeongdong or Hongdae but still 
bustling in its own unique way for a more cultural   and artsy stay in Seoul Insadong would be perfect 
and finally Gangnam Gangnam is like the Beverly   Hills of Seoul upscale trendy and filled with 
high-end boutiques and luxurious accommodations   you'll find everything from designer stores to 
chic night life here and let's not forget the   famous Gangnam Style statue this area offers a 
sleek and polished version of Seoul ideal for   travelers looking to experience the more glamorous 
side of the city accommodations here can be a bit   pricier but if you're into the high life Gangnam 
will give you that taste of luxury Seoul has   many more neighborhoods to explore like Ewan sinon 
Dongdamun and Jamil but if it's your first time in   the city these four areas provide the perfect mix 
of everything Seoul has to offer the city is super   well connected so honestly just booking a decent 
hotel near a major bus stop or train station will   do I'll include links in the description for some 
of the best affordable hotels near some transport   hubs so you can have easy access to all the top 
tourist spots and stick until the end of this   video where we'll share an ideal 7-Day budget

a picnic mat both spots give you a slice of nature   without leaving the city number three go palace 
hopping in a hanbok step into Korea's rich   history as you explore five royal palaces in the 
heart of Seoul with Gyeongbokgung as their largest   and most prestigious one typically entrance 
fees to each palace cost around $2 but here's   a travel hack admission is completely free for 
all palaces if you're dressed in a traditional   hanbok trust me wandering these iconic sites 
in a hanbok doesn't just save you money   it'll also make your social feeds look straight 
out of a K-drama rentals start at only $11 for   a 4-hour rental and it even includes basic hair 
styling to complete the look then afterwards you   can also explore the nearby Bukchon Hanuk Village a 
charming historical village filled with centuries   old Korean houses palace hopping and strolling 
through these narrow alleys truly feels like   stepping into a different era this experience 
is a must especially if it's your first time in   Seoul number two pick up a book at the Starfield 
libraries if you're in Seoul or Suwon the Starfield   libraries are a must visit start with the iconic 
Starfield library at Coex m in Seoul a two-story   marvel featuring 13M high bookshelves filled with 
over 50,000 books and magazines this vibrant space   is perfect for relaxing with a good read grabbing 
a cup of coffee or simply snapping photos against   its cool architectural backdrop now the newest 
Starfield library in Suwon offers a bigger grander   and more instagrammable design with much more 
seating and much more cafes best of all both   libraries are completely free to visit making them 
a paradise for book lovers and cafe hoppers alike   and for number one last but not least our 
number one favorite thing to do in Seoul is this if you're hunting for the best budget eats 
in Seoul we've got you covered we explored 20   different food stops from viral street food 
and affordable Korean barbecue to cozy cafes   by the waterfalls only to bring you the top 50 
best affordable eats and drinks in the city in   our separate food vlog we try out 50 different 
bestsellers at 20 legendary food spots and we   give you our 100% honest reviews plus we also

YouTube channel this food vlog will help you   save money on your next Korea food trip well 
those were the top 10 most popular tours and   activities in South Korea so you can choose which 
one best fits your lifestyle and if you have extra   days there are also amazing spots outside of Seoul 
that's worth a visit like Busan for its stunning   beaches Jeju Island AKA The Hawaii of South Korea 
Sokcho for its beautiful mountain views and Gyeongju   a historic city with ancient temples and Royal 
tombs and honestly if you're looking for the most   budget friendly way to experience all of Seoul's 
main attractions I highly recommend pre-booking   your tours in advance it's usually cheaper to book 
online than booking on the spot and day tours are   super affordable covering everything from transpo 
to entrance fees so you can hit multiple spots in   a single day without the hassle of planning just 
pick your tour and enjoy the ride again I'll leave   all of the discounted links in the description 
below and don't forget to use the coupon code   Angelicawandersklook for an extra discount but 
if group tours aren't your thing and you'd rather   explore on your own that brings us to our next 
question how to get around Seoul DIY style let   me give you four of the best ways tourists can 
explore soul on their own number one commute Soul   Subway and bus stations are fast affordable and 
easy to navigate they are the best budget friendly   ways to reach major tourist spots in the city and 
you can conveniently use your reloadable t- money   card to tap on and off at the stations since 
Google Maps isn't widely used in Korea neighbor   Maps is your go-to app for directions just enter 
your starting point and destination and it will   show you the best routes Subway Lines and bus 
connections depending on where you're coming from   and where you're headed number two book a taxi or 
an Uber taxis and soul are widely available clean   and convenient however just be aware that not all 
drivers speak English so it can be helpful to have   your destination written in Korean or use a 
translator app otherwise you can book rides   directly using the Uber app and simply pin your 
exact destination to avoid any miscommunication   number three take the Hop On Hop off city bus tour 
this open double-decker bus offers a comfortable   and flexible way to explore Soul's top attractions 
at your own pace with 15 convenient bus stops   including popular spots like Mong dong Namsan Park 
and Bon hanuk Village simply hop on and hop off at   any point on the route with buses arriving every 
30 to 40 minutes make making it stressfree without   the need to plan routes a day pass costs only $18 
per head and option four is to book a private car   okay now hear me out this is honestly the best 
DIY option for exploring soul and it's actually   more affordable than you'd expect while private 
cars might seem pricey they can actually save you   loads of time money and effort especially if 
you're traveling with a group you can easily   book a 10-hour Private Car Charter with a driver 
fully customize your itinerary choose the places   you want want to go mix and match tours and Skip 
any attractions you're not interested in it's your   own little adventure for 10 hours just sit back 
and enjoy the ride and the best part diesel is   already included in the cost for a 10-hour car 
Charter the price can go as low as $178 for six   people so if you're with a group of six that's 
only about $30 per head let me repeat including   fuel imagine exploring soul with your own private 
car and driver for just 30 bucks each this is   seriously the ultimate budget hack if you're 
traveling with a group I'll leave the links in the   description so you can book these affordable car 
rentals well now that we've covered the best areas   to stay the best things to do and the best food

money for that and of course you can explore   other places around South Korea like Busan juu

our 7-Day itinerary is simply a guide ideal for   first- timers who want to witness the best of the 
best of South Korea within a short span of 7 Days   also we try to keep our Vlogs as least personal as 
possible but I just want to mention this because   this was actually the main reason we booked our 
flights and that was to attend twice as fan meet   which was a K-pop event so that's another thing 
you can do in Korea because concert tickets are   dramatically cheaper here as compared to the 
Philippines like VIP tickets in the Philippines   are like $300 whereas here in Korea it can go as 
low as $70 to $100 so just consider your career   trip like saving money okay I'm joking but we

nous but I'm also super excited I've done so much research I've planned an itinerary pack my bags and practice my cantones so without further Ado let's go to China [Music] [Music] [Music] hello guys from Hong Kong I have finally made it that flight was so long and I only really slept 4 to 5 hours at the hotel here I am so jetlagged it's 7:15 right now and I'm actually going to head out to get some dim suum because I want to start off the trip right and I have the most jam-packed itinerary without further Ado let's get going this is the view from my hotel room you can see the mountain in the back there and condo buildings on there I think that's so [Music] [Music] cool okay I finally found it it's on corner right here I am so embarrassed right now I cannot okay it's okay I think I'm the only Foreigner in this place right now it's okay we learn and we learn I just got some green tea I honestly didn't understand the options but I'll drink anything I'm easy going like I'm not here to impose on [Music] anybody that's super super good I'm going to try this right now I was literally joking with Angley and Garo that there might be a b of problem with the language barrier I might not receive what I order the woman did speak English but then she just gave me something else so that's okay I think it's pork and green it's not bad but it's also not what I ordered okay I'm walking underneath something but it is raining so I just picked up this umbrella from a convenience store I'm headed to this really popular coffee shop that does really cool lass art and so I wanted to have a little caffeine before I went to hike Victoria Peak but I'm not sure if I should go anymore because of the rain so [Music] so I decided to hike Victoria Peak anyways it is raining so much I haven't experienced rain like this in such a long time probably last time I went to Vietnam my pants are soaking but it's honestly really quiet so I'm having a great time crazy incline everywhere but I'm having fun [Music] all of my stuff including me is soaking wet but I finally made it to the Viewpoint that I was hiking towards because it has this really great view of Victoria Harbor so glad that I waited out the rain because look at this View [Music] made it to the peak and I think I'm going to get a lemon iced tea because I deserve a [Music] treat my ice Pon tea has been and uh they gave me a little bit of vanilla syrup it's good I just need like five of [Music] [Music] these I am back at my hotel and I just picked up a ham and egg bun because I want to go to a really well-known Bakery for my first pineapple bun and egg t heart in Hong Kong I just came back to change my clothes because I was soaked to the bone hiking and I'm so cold can you tell that I've never opened a bottle before I haven't had any water today and I seriously regret not getting something before my hype but time for my hem and egg bun this thing is huge so good [Music] I feel like an old lady I'm getting ready for bed and it's only 8:30 but I have been awake since 3:30 a.m. but of course I have to do my skincare first this is the medic pdrn pink peptide serum it helps brighten hydrate and strengthen your skin the salmon DNA helps promote skin cell repair and the five peptide complex can improve skin elasticity and firmness to give you that plump and juicy glass skin I usually do two and 1 half drops of this roughly spread that all over before going in with the new affordable Glow Booster this is the Booster Pro Mini and I swear by this machine's Tech because it maximizes the effects of your skin care it helps your skin absorb the ingredients better it always leaves my skin feeling way more hydrated and you can use it up to 5 to 10 minutes three times a day and go up to level two or level three I usually keep it on level [Music] three my skin loves when I use these two together and I just love the redesign of this because it's more compact it can fit in my tiny travel skincare bag and it's more affordable so more of you guys can get it there's going to be a spring sale on March 25th make sure to check out the link in my description box below and lastly I'm going to lock in all my skincare with the medic Cube gel mask it's the pdrn pink collagen gel mask if you guys have seen my other videos and you've definitely seen me wear this multiple times I feel like it really locks in my skincare and is the perfect ending to my nighttime skincare routine and now I'm ready to get into bed and elevate my feet because I walked 20,000 steps which is very abnormal for me and good night guys I'll see you in the morning [Music] hi guys welcome to day two of Hong Kong I've just gotten dress I have red shoes on and I'm going to pack my purse and I know this is a lot of black so I'm breaking up with this jean jacket it's also a little bit cold and this is my bag to match my shoes what's in here we can do a what's in my bag we have a portable charger two cameras my GoPro and my g7x I have my little airpods lactate lip um and an extra battery for my DSLR um oh I literally just went to go look to show you my DSLR but you are my DSLR and then my phone and some Hong Kong dollars and I have my debit card in here so I can withdraw more cash and if you're wondering how I'm taking pictures by myself I'm using this little tripod that collapses fully and just fits in this purse like look just fits in there so without further Ado let's get going so lost in the subway station because there's so many floors and there's so many escalators but I finally made it and we're going to Australia Dairy Co because everyone loves it for Hong Kong style [Music] [Music] breakfast for [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] so I'm in right now and I meant to just do a bunch of shopping and browsing but it's really really busy so I'm feeling a little overwhelmed and honestly I'm happy to just stand and people watch so I've been doing a bit of that as well [Music] okay I got my first egg chart of my trip I got it from this really popular spot it was recommended in a few YouTube videos that I've watched and on Red Hook so let's give it a try and it was 7 Hong Kong dollars what it looks like that is so good this crust is super crisp but it's still flaky and buttery if that makes sense I feel like egg cards in Canada are leaning heavy on The Buttery side but they don't have that like crisp Crunch and there's like so many [Music] layers okay now I am in sham Street Bo it's known to have flea markets on two separate streets and there's this one stand that I'm looking forward to that has a bunch of vintage cameras so I'm really excited to check them out [Music] ouch it looks like I came at a really busy time because I think everyone's doing their groceries right now everything looks so [Music] good I'm not sure if this is the exact one that I'm looking for but I did find a still that has a ton of CDs and just the hug cameras [Music] guys I have walked up and down so many of these streets I'm so lost and I think I finally found the vintage camera shop that I was looking for [Music] I didn't end up getting anything from the second vintage camera store because they didn't have my dream dream camera and I didn't want to settle and also pay the same price that I could get on eBay so now I'm having Curry fish balls from the stand that I just found on the corner [Music] okay one of our last stops of the night is going to be Tang at Dynasty and I actually found this place from redw because all the girles on there were posting these really cute magnets of the subway station I hope to get a [Music] bunch I just finished therapy it is now 2:30 in the morning and I thought I would show you guys my haul so far I've actually been really proud of my self-control and I haven't just been buying every single thing that I've seen I got all of these from elegant Tang Dynasty these are maang tile keychains that I thought were really cute this is like the subway station sign I got this one and then this one is the classic Hong Kong milk tea I also did end up getting one digital camera but it's the Olympus U model it's fully functioning and so this is the shop if you guys want to go and support this woman she was super sweet and super patient with me I was testing a bunch of cameras out now I'm going to head to bed because I have a full day ahead good morning guys it is day three in Hong Kong and I am leaving the house very very late today this is a little sneak peek of my [Music] outfit you guys you have no idea how happy I am right now because the sun is out finally I'm in Happy Valley for the morning CU I'm going to this really popular spot for Hong Kong style breakfast [Music] [Music] [Music] okay I'm walking through Happy Valley now breakfast was actually insanely good I am so happy that I went there and when I was on the we passed by this like huge green space and there's a bunch of people playing sports I thought it was part of Hong Kong U but I looked it up and it looks like just a regular public park but it is literally so wellmaintained I thought it had to be a part of the univers Mercy cuz I was like there's no way this is like a city park but I think it is just like a recreational space which is so cool because there's not a lot of those in Toronto if any okay I left Happy Valley and guys this weather is making me so happy but I definitely took the weekdays for granted because it is so busy I don't know if it's just the area I'm in I'm on Lee Tong Avenue and I'm just doing a little bit of shopping and browsing I'm headed to Stussy right now I want to get one of those eightball shirts that have Kong on the back because I don't want like a classic ihart Hong Kong shirt but I do want some sort of souvenir and I love a good back print on a shirt guys the Line This is the longest queue I've seen in Hong Kong [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm back at Central and this time I'm at fake house this was the most recommended spot for Barts and yeah and then I also am going to walk over to Vision Bakery and see if they have this like matcha tart that one of you guys give me that you love but they're only sold afternoon and it's already like 4:30 p.m. so I'm not sure if they're already sold out but we're going to check [Music] I got two things from makos and I got a quamon from Vision this I am so excited this is what the egg tart looks like definitely the most baked out of all the egg Tarts I've had oh my God I thought because so many people were recommending it it was going to be like overhyped and I know it's like a tour spot and that's why there's a queue every single time but no this is worth all of the hype now I'm upset that I only got one I also got this dessert from Bak house I don't if I love that the middle part where there's like custard and strawberry is really good but the outside part of it kind of dry now we're going to get into what I got from Vision this is my quinon hm it's really good but just tastes like it was baked 12 hours ago I should have come earlier this is better than the strawberry Danish but it's not better than the egg tart and I wouldn't order it again okay and that marks the end of Cl Street treat review but anyways I'm headed to Kennedy town now to hopefully catch the sunset by the water and also have dinner there because I can't just keep eating treats [Music] so there's this really pretty photo up in Kennedy town and it's in a basketball court and a shot is taken through the gates of a basketball court and so I'm going to have to disturb some of these people you can see here's a bunch of people okay but it looks like they roped it off because they knew how busy it's spin [Music]",1,The video is a personal travel vlog

until the end of this video because we give you the ultimate 5-day budget itinerary and also a cost breakdown so you can get an idea of how much a Sapa trip could cost and without further Ado let's explore Sapa Vietnam first up let's talk about how to get there well since there is no airport in Sapa your journey starts with a flight to Hanoi Vietnam and from there you've got three options to reach Sapa but don't worry we'll guide you through each one step by step option one you can take the bus buses run three times a day from hano's old quarter to sapat town while you could choose between morning or afternoon departures we highly recommend the overnight bus it's a total timesaver the ride takes about 6 hours departing around 10: p.m. and getting you to stop at around 5:00 a.m. it's like sleeping your way through the trip and you've got two bus types to choose from the sleeper bus which is a budget friendly option at just $10 per person or the cabin bus which is a more private experience for only $15 per person now option two you can take the train if you're after a little more charm and comfort the Night Train is a fantastic choice it's slower than the bus about 8 to 10 hours but it's basically a mini Hotel on Wheels you get pillows comforters clean bathrooms power outlets and even complimentary snacks and drinks rates start around $35 to $40 one way now option three you can take a 3 days two nights tour from Hanoi for those who'd rather skip the hassle of planning you can book a 3-day all-inclusive tour from Hanoi these tours cover roundtrip transpo accommodation a few meals and a pre-planned itinerary while it might not be the most flexible choice you won't get to pick your hotel or adjust the schedule it's perfect if you're happy to go with the flow and let the pros handle the details prices start at $92 for a 2-day group tour and $127 for a 3-day group tour so which option is best honestly all three options will get you to Sapa so it really depends on your budget and travel style to make things easier we've added all the discount links for the night bus the night train and the all-inclusive tours in the description below just just pick what works for you but before your trip here's something you should know when is the best time to visit Sapa the best time to visit Sapa is during spring from March to May or during Autumn from September to November these months bring warmer weather clearer skies and stunning views of the blooming flowers and golden Rice Terraces if you prefer a chilly Misty Vibe winter from December to February would be best while temperatures can drop to near freezing and the fog might cover up the views you might be lucky to catch some snow no dusted landscapes for trekers or outdoor adventurers it's best to avoid the rainy season from June to August as heavy rains can make trekking slippery however this is when the rice Tes are at their Lush vibrant green an absolute dream for nature lovers okay so now that you've flown to Hanoi and took a night bus to Sapa now it's time to head to your hotel but the question is where is the best place to stay in Sapa well if you want to be in the heart of the action close to all the best shops and restaurants staying in Sapa Town proper is your best bet but if you're after a peaceful escape with stunning views there are dreamy home stays about 20 to 30 minutes outside of town for Budget Home stays prices can go as low as $15 to $30 per night for mid-range hotels Prices range from $30 to $50 per night and for high-end hotels prices can go up to $150 to $200 per night we've got a separate Vlog on our Channel called the top seven most beautiful hotels in Sapa where we explored everything from $20 home stays to $200 luxury hotels both with

five most popular tours and activities in Sapa so you can choose which one best fits your lifestyle again I highly recommend pre-booking your tours it's usually cheaper to book online than booking on the spot I'll leave all the discounted tour and activity links in the description and don't forget to use the coupon code Angelica wanders clue for an extra discount now if you don't want to book any tours and you'd rather explore on your own this leads us to our next question how to get around Sapa DIY style option one you can rent a scooter this is one of the most affordable ways to get around Sapa and it gives you the freedom to explore at your own pace scooter rentals are around $6 per day and Diesel is about $1 per liter just be sure to have a valid license wear a helmet and follow local Road Rules keep in mind though that sapa's mountainous Terran can be challenging so if you're not the most confident Rider this might not be the best option for you option two you can take a taxi taxis are easy to find in Sapa but most of them will not use the meter at all and might even ask for a higher price the good news is that you can book a ride through a ride hailing app like grab taxi in my experience grab is usually cheaper than regular taxis and you won't have to worry about overpaying option three my favorite option and that is to book a private car with a driver though it might sound pricey it's actually more affordable than you'd expect a private car allows you to customize your itinerary visit the spots you want skip the ones you don't and just sit back and enjoy the ride and here's the best part fuel is already included in the cost you can book an 8-hour Private Car Charter for as low as $76 for 4 people imagine that's less than 20 bucks per person and I repeat including fuel this this is seriously the ultimate budget hack if you're traveling with a group I'll leave these Affordable Car Rental links in the description now regardless of how you get around your trip would be so much easier if you have internet I highly recommend pre-booking an eim so you can navigate your way around Vietnam eim prices start at just $7 for 7 Days of unlimited data or if you're staying longer you can get 30 days of unly data for only $15 make sure to pre-book this in advance to get the best prices and trust me have access to maps and ride hailing apps will save you a lot of time and money I'll leave some discount links for the most affordable eims in the description below well now that we've covered the best places to visit the best things to do and the best food to eat it's time for us to put it all together and form the ultimate 5-day budget itinerary and cost breakdown feel free to screenshot or save this video for future reference and please note that the prices are considering that you've traveled with a partner so in some cases you could split the costs so let's talk pre- expenses before your trip begins you generally book your piece of sale flight all your hotels and your internet plan your pre- expenses would probably amount to around $157 per head now we start off with day Zero because technically you'll still need to fly to Hanoi first and once you arrive at the airport you can take a taxi to Old quarter if you get there early you can explore some spots in the area but if you arrive later in the afternoon you might want to just grab some dinner or relax at a Cafe until it's time to catch the night bus at 10: p.m. the total estimated cost for Day Zero would be $22 per head now for day 1 it's 6:00 a.m. and you've finally arrived in Sapa since most hotels have a 2:00 p.m. check-in time just drop your backs at your hotel lobby and head out for breakfast to fuel up for the day once you're ready head to the Sapa Convention Center which is the starting point for the Alpine Coaster shuttle vent hop onto the coaster for an exhilarating 5 to 10 minute ride packed with twists turns and breathtaking views afterward catch the shuttle back to town but here's a little travel hack you'll pass Moana Sapa along the way so just ask your driver to drop you off there it's the perfect spot to capture Instagram worthy shots at iconic attractions like the Moana statue Heaven's Gate the giant hand and more for lunch take a short walk to a place called the yummy restaurant which is just nearby we highly recommend trying their chicken curry served in a coconut and grilled beef in a bamboo pipe both delicious local Specialties and don't forget if you're hunting for the best eaten Sapa at budget friendly prices our Sapa food blog is up on our YouTube channel then from the restaurant grab a taxi back to your hotel to finally check in if you're staying in the city center it's easy to head out later for an early dinner before returning to the hotel to call it an early night the total estimated cost for day one would be $23 per head for day two you can start your day with a free breakfast at your hotel then it's time to go to the fancy pan first step is to go to Sapa station then hop onto the famous monreal to make your way to the cable car station from there take the 30-minute cable car up to fancy Pan Station and then walk up the flight of stairs to the peak after exploring the peak make your way back to fancy Pan Station and thankfully there's a free buffet lunch included in the ticket I'll leave this

10-minute stroll since the car rental already includes fuel for 8 hours you can customize the rest of of the trip just ask your driver to take you to other nearby spots and make the most of your 8-hour booking the total estimated cost for day three would be $63 per head for day four you can book the Matra and taffin Village trekking tour for just $28 this tour is the perfect way to immerse yourself in the rich traditions of the Mong Community also since you'll be taking the night bus back to Hanoi tonight it's a good idea to check out of your hotel in the morning before the tour begins and just leave your bags in the lock then once you return to town grabb an early dinner and spend some time relaxing at a cafe until it's time to leave then pick up your bags from the hotel lobby and hop onto the night bus Which departs at 10: p.m. the total estimated cost for day four would be $44 per head and finally we have day five this is your arrival in Hanoi thankfully many night buses can drop you off directly at the airport so you could just chill at the airport until your flight departs but if you're up for it you can always extend your trip and spend a few extra days exploring Hanoi otherwise just head straight to the airport and wrap up your Sapa Adventure the total estimated cost for day5 would be $5 per head and there you have it the ultimate 5-day budget itinerary for first

360}}",UC0QN7HmXtIixc1TOBYNTKbw,cXOPiA1a3CY,1081,184915,en,cXOPiA1a3CY,[Music] the suitcase is packed we leave to go to Florida in less than 24 hours so you know what that means we need a last minute Target run something about going to Target right before you leave for a trip just hits different I actually don't even have anything I really need but it's so fun to wander and like see if anything speaks to me so I'm very excited to do that but we're going down to St p to move my sister in she's moving down there and I'm so excited for her and we're making like a little family trip out of it so that should be very fun but I have a lot to do before we go I recently got these hokas and I honestly think they're the cutest ones I've ever made I'll put them on my ltk but I'm obsessed with them and they're so comfy someone commented and said they look like a Dairy Queen sunde I just think that's so cute but the color scheme and everything is just perfect I always feel so cute put together when I'm wearing them and also I just switch to a new bagu I love it so much so here is the fit for wanting around a Target okay we're at Target we're not here this is actually a video we're not here for anything specific but I have found one thing oh um I found one thing and now I'm trying to decide what nail polish I get cuz I need to paint my toes before we go okay I'm trying to decide between this yellow and this blue he's hiding we just got done to Target so we're going to give a little haul Catherine's here too so first thing I got is the big version of my face cleanser that I've been using I have just like a travel size right now so I feel like this will be really good I got this body scrub which one is that one cocoa colada yum that body scrubs good sounds delicious that sounds really scrub I might eat a little bit on the car right I'm using it in the shower it's like a little snack okay then I got these two nail polishes cuz I couldn't decide which one to get and I just felt like they were so pretty together too so might do something with these before the trip I got this aala I was influenced by Hannah I love she has so many different aalas and I only have one I needed I needed some color in my life so that one is so cute I don't have any of the straw ones cuz especially now with my trust issues with the straw straw but I do love aala oh that's so cute though it makes me want that one and then my last two things are Necessities I love this stuff I just ran out and it's just the best for like after I've shaved in the shower so perfect and a tiny little version of our mouthwash so that's all I'm feeling ready to pack I always like to do whitening strips before a trip so I just put these on Matt and I are going to watch Love Island USA and theode came out tonight so I put this on so I could like wear them through part of the episode kind of makes me talk weird and then I was thinking about giving my hair a little trim it's so healthy right now but I noticed like a couple split ends today and I just want to bite that in the butt I cut my hair myself often so I have like actual hair scissors and I just don't love like paying to go to a salon just for like a trim and I don't get my hair dyed anymore so it's just a lot easier to do it myself but I mean I'm not necessarily good at it or anything and I would necessar really recommend it but it just works for me and I feel like because I do this so often I don't like needed to cut very much off which is so nice honestly that looks really good I have messed up cutting my hair before though which was like a little traumatizing I tried to do like curtain bangs and I just cut way too much but I just I don't know I like to do it I have been wanting to go to get my hair dyed though at least like little highlight or like a really subtle money piece something to add just like a little bit of Dimension before the fall let me know if you think I should do that I'm really inspired by like Rachel green hair um from friends I think her hair is so cute so maybe something just like really natural highlights through and like a cute haircut with layers I don't know I need something new because I always just wear my hair up because I don't love how it is right now but I just I'm scared to commit to something so we'll see now I need to go watch some love [Music] Island okay now it's time for me to start packing I'm going to make a little packing list on here to help me stay focused and I'm going to put on some love Island because I saved last night's episode so that I could watch it while I was packing today I started just writing down some of like the basic things that I need to remember to pack but I like to make it very in depth so that's what I'm going to work on right now also this trip I'm going to try to plan out my outfits before try them on take a picture in them so that I can be really minimal with my packing because I think I'll be sharing a room with Sid and her friend so I don't know how much room we'll have for everything I don't know if I'll be able to unpack so it'll just be so much easier to have the outfits already planned and be able to like work out in my suitcase okay I just did a brain dump of all the things I could think of I'm going to categorize them and then get back to you guys I always put the things I'm worried I'll forget right at the top so starting off I have my wallala my bagu my iPad laptop charger film camera film book Kindle tripod crochet stuff fun games watercolor stuff makeup toiletries razor jewelry rings and then all this is kind of like beach stuff so my beach bag towel towel hoodies sunscreen and bikinis and then socks on these bras four te's four tanks comfy shorts denim shorts PJs and maybe jeans sometimes I love to wear like jeans in a bikini tops to Sunset I don't know if there'll be a time for that but like I always want to pack the jeans just in case and then I have kind of just like a random section of like specific things so I have these two satin dresses I need to get pictures for for allive Linn so I have that on here a cute sundress a cute coffee shop fit my free people yellow Ry My Free People blue Romper it's like the T-shirt Romper I wear all the time I have my shoes so hocus some cute shoes flip flops and I just got some new Adas gazel they're so cute so I want to bring those on this trip but that is all my stuff in my packing list now is the chaotic part I just grab everything out that I think I could possibly need put it on my bed and then separate it out speaking of myid disc I have been wanting these for like a year now and I kept thinking they were going to like go out of style or i' stopped wanting them so I didn't want to order them but they've been on my mind Forever on my Pinterest boards forever so I finally bought them they are so cute I'm obsessed I can't wait to style outfits with them I think they'll be really cute like in Disney and things like that because I love my other pair but this one just feels like it'll match a lot more but I'm so excited to wear these and to pack them for this [Music] trip I just finished grabbing on a bunch bu of the stuff throwing it on my bed I'm waiting on a lot of things in the wash right now that I know I want to pack which kind of makes it harder but I'm going to try to put together a couple outfits with what I have right here and kind of like narrow this stuff down before that stuff is ready for me one thing I do know is I want to bring one of these they're like the Free People runs I wear them all the time and one of the days where're they were're going to be helping my sister unpack she's moving down to Florida so I feel like this could be a good outfit I've worn this one so much recently but still I love it so much I'm honestly thinking I'm going to do the yellow I love the pink but this just is so submarine cute so that's one thing narrowed [Music] down it's time to pack it up now I have faith that I can do this part pretty fast I still need to narrow everything down but I'm going to do that as I'm putting them into the packing cubes let me grab those I actually just got these new packing cubes from CPAC I'll try to link as much as I can in the description but I'm a big packing cubes girl I have loved using them for so long these two I got from Thrive wallets and they're perfect for like little Electronics socks things like that but these CPAC ones are just so good the color adorable I'm obsessed with them and they're more structured than the other pack keeps I have which I love then I have these are just random ones from Amazon I got them before my Europe trip and thank goodness I did they kept me so organized and when I'm on the trip I'll use one of the bags as like my dirty laundry so then it's even easier when I'm packing up to leave I'm going to have this cute one from bagu I love this one to put my socks in something about it is just perfect for that first thing I want to go through is bikinis you're on all the bikinis you're on all of them stop it since this is a family trip I know will mainly be just like hanging out playing in the water things like that like it's not as focused on taking a bunch of pictures it'll just be like whatever's in the moment so I'm not too stressed about bringing a ton of swimsuits whereas like when I have photos I want to take or anything like that I have like a vision of different suits I want to use so I'm just going to bring a lot of my tried and true starting off very strong this suit definitely going let's see if we can f them all in this so starting off fruit one I think this has gone on every single trip that I've ever gone on since I bought it next this one is one that I love it's a triangle pink white stripe that is coming of course this suit has to come I think it's honestly my like summer favorite I'm just obsessed with the triangle shape this orange one I love it but the top just isn't the best I'm not gravitating towards this color so I don't need to bring this one I don't know why I think this one will be so fun so I'm going to bring it I never wear red suits but I feel like that's the fun of it this is a brand new one I got I think it's so cute I feel like it'll be fun the bottoms are like a little different than my usual but I kind of feel like that's fun let me think how many days it is that's a lot of days that's a lot of suits that means I'm going to be bringing probably all the rest of these this one obsessed with it it needs to come it's so cute for like Sunset and everything this is another perfect one because it's just like the triangle style o I'm obsessed with this one again another triangle style I wore this one a bunch in Hawaii so cute okay our packing cubees getting pretty full I got this one acally in a size to big and so I just don't love it like it doesn't need to come with me this time between these two I'm going to go with this one I always go more towards like pinks and oranges for suits okay that gives me 1 2 3 4 nine suits for 6 days I feel like that's enough like he has let's say I do a sunrise a sunset a swimsuit a day I feel like that's kind of perfect and add these two in this is a cute colorful one and this blue one perfect once I get suits done I'm good cuz that is one of the biggest parts for me I love packing for car trips because I can overpack as much as I want I don't have to weigh my my suitcase it's just way nicer not as stressful okay suits done next is an easy one sweatshirts so I'm going to bring this one their's is really cute I think it's a trend right now you like have your suitcase and you have everything like really aesthetically in it and like some people be like this girl's going to Disney or like ready for a Florida trip like something like that and so I really want to do it but also it sounds so nice to get done packing really quick so we will see if I do that or not I think if I'm going to do that I need to like stack everything that I'm bringing instead of putting into my suitcase so that I can like pull the things out with aesthetic I don't know it's very tempting I feel like I'm going to set myself up to do it because it just it would be kind of fun I love like aesthetic pinteresting things so first sweatshirt I'll wear this one in the car tomorrow so I'm going to set it aside for my cart trip fot and my other sweatshirt these are just for like on the colder nights or like if we go to Sunrise or sunset or anything like that so cute this will probably be in that cute little aesthetic Summer video and I don't usually put those in packing cubes just because I'll just lay them in so next thing I don't usually put in a packing cube is t-shirts lla sat on the hangers and broke both of them for sure um we're not going to Disney on this trip but I do always like to bring Disney t-shirts just in case and because I like to wear them like all the time anyways this is one I cut the neckline of so cute Dairy Florida so I'm bringing four t-shirts I feel like that'll be enough this one is a Newland one I think I already showed it next I'm going to do tanks because those do go in a packing Cube this is where usually overpacked when I start adding in all the random things but this little top this tank of course will probably go in my little video so I'm going set it as side this is one of my favorite tanks just a classic should be able to do laundry there and then this is a new one supposed to be like a little PJ set but I'm bringing it just in case I want to wear it out too tanks are packed up and there's room in the packing Cube so I think I'm going to put shorts in there as well I love all these shorts and then with the shorts I'm just going to toss in my little runsie it's like shorts tank combo another packing Cube done okay now moving on to other types of like pants denim shorts pulling these out for the C trip a good pair of jeans my linen pants of course and then these pink and orange pants I'm obsessed with them also in that packing Cube I'm going to put this little t-shirt Romper I just have cute tops and dresses left to fit them in here and in with the rest of the pants I feel like this is going way too fast like I'm forgetting something but maybe it's just cuz I'm focused and actually getting it done tops some random dresses is woohoo last little packing Cube hey I still have room in this packing Cube so I'll probably leave it empty for in case I have random things to toss in I think this is going to be my beach bag for the week it's so cute it's new and I love it so this will be my weekly beach bag and then I forgot I put little bags inside so I'll probably use these as packing cubes as well this needs to be for something so cute I usually put like my towel sunscreen hat those types of things in my beach bag so that it's literally already packed for me going to put my hat in there and my towel hoodie then I'm going to fill this guy up I think with like ra uny socks because it's so cute and I need to use it for something and I am literally packing like 20 underwear because you can never be too safe I lost like all of my socks so I do need to order some new ones I might even have to grab some while while we're there because I'm only packing three pairs and usually I wear at least one a day so we'll have to figure that out when we're there but socks undies done I always overpack when it comes to shoes because I just I love all my shoes and I can't think of leaving any of them at home so bring in this pair in case we go out to dinner at all one of the nights these just cuz I think they're so fun and then I'll probably wear these for the car trip I love them shoes and my hookas but I'm going to check my packing list and see if I'm forgetting anything but I'm feeling pretty good next up skincare and makeup I'm going to try to put all my skincare in here and all of my makeup into either this bag or this blue one I kind of feel like the blue one just to keep it on [Music] theme okay I've got my skin care in here makeup in here this is for any like random lastet things like toothbrush toothpaste deodorant whatever I might end up putting like stuff like this in here after we do that cute little aesthetic video but that's what we've got going on so far okay here's a little progress report I have my cow pack for all my random last minute things toiletries laptop that sort of stuff this bagu because right now I'm using my brown stripe one but I know I'm going to want that one at the beach then I have these random things we have more packing cubes more stuff that stuff's going to go in the cow pack I need to check my packing list this is my fit for the car trip tomorrow I'm going to put everything I need right in this little thread wallet and then obviously this stuff [Music] okay I just finished doing the kitty little layout I'll show you guys what it looks like but I'm obsessed with it I'm so glad I did I was kind of feeling like I want to just like rush through get packed up really quick but I just love these types of things so I just think it was really cute how it turned out but now I'm going to go through my checklist and then put everything into the suitcase because I'm ready to be packed it looks perfect I'm almost sad to dismantle this to actually pack but it needs to be [Music] done the suitcase is a packed I'm so happy that I got this done next I need to pack the cow pack oh my gosh and I'm leaving room in here to fill in in the morning with my toiletry bag that's why I only filled it halfway but cow pack is basically packed good morning I'm officially all packed up and we are about to drive down to Florida I think we have like an 8 to 9

make things that are just so weird these are actual items that people sell online like I I have so many questions I'm on a mission to test and recreate some of the most ridiculous handmade items because I want to learn to appreciate this unique form of creativity and uncover its Secrets first up is this blinged out Ranch bottle like that's literally the title of it it's just Ranch covered in Tiny Little Gems and it's being sold for over $1100 the description claims that it's a Chic and unique condiment that will add a touch of Glamour to any table obviously I need this type of Glamour up in my life but I'm not spending a $100 to buy it and it would be pretty ridiculous to make it myself so I okay yep guess I'm doing it then I got some rhinestones from Amazon a nice classic bottle of ranch and began the slow process of gluing each individual gem onto it I don't know why I thought this would be a good idea it's been like 30 minutes and I only have 1 2 three five rows done uh yeah this is going to take a while but there was no turning back I was committed now an hour later and only about half of it was covered my patience was truly being tested but I kept at it until finally I was gluing on the last row here it is my very own Royal Ranch bottle oh my goodness this is ridiculous but look at its shine it's very pretty I mean you could hang it from a string like a little disco ball but other than that what are you supposed to do with this do I use it do I just put it on a shelf for display it's definitely a weird one I don't know why this exists but as promised my life does feel more glamorous now this may look just like ordinary food but it's actually soap it just boggles my mind that that's not real food I don't know I have no clue how they do it but I bought some so we're going to find out no way what are you serious it's got It's got all the little seasoning and the texture how is this soap okay I got to put it to the test it would have been a plot twist if this was in fact just real chicken but nope it was the nicest honey glaze scented soap I have ever used I actually enjoyed washing my hands for once I am wildly impressed by this DIY regular soap is just so boring now this this is the new cool thing to have okay continuing on with the topic of food this is the allseeing Lemon I don't even know where to begin with this one maybe I'll start with why like I don't understand and honestly it scares me but it has over 500 reviews and people love it I got to read you some of these Taylor says this thing is awesome and creepy I love it Jason says the lemon watches me oh always oh my and Aiden and Aiden said put it in my boss's office and got fired 10 out of 10 the the lemon out here causing unemployment okay and this is what Lisa had to say love this placed it in the bathroom the bathroom Lisa are you serious I think if I recreate it then I will hopefully overcome my fear of it instead of using silicone I used air dry clay and started by forming a basic lemon shape I got these plastic eyeballs online and just smooshed one into the center part then I carved in some details used a sponge to add texture and once it was dry enough I added some paint and resin here it is my very own allseen lemon my goodness this thing is terrifying this has got to be the the weirdest thing I've ever made did I overcome my fear of it no I did not so I left it at the grocery store for someone else to have I knew that handmade lip balm was a thing but I had no idea that dill pickle lip balm existed the description says sounds weird but strangely addicting we're going to find out because I got [Music] some wo that that's whack literally smells exactly like dill pickles I'm not no exaggeration now the question is does it taste like dill [Music] pickles that's so weird oh it's like I just ate a bunch of dill pickle air every breath I take it's just more and more uh what am I doing why am I why am I eating lip balm right now but I can't stop I'm addicted this next one is marshmallow Shooters and the person who makes them is an and she seems like the sweetest lady ever but secretly she's just a weapons dealer you know I have to make one and test it out so I went and got some PVC pipe and a bunch of connector pieces then I cut the pipe down into the different sizes and put it all together there's a ton of positive reviews on this let me read you some Ashley said amazing stocking stuffer my Dad loved shooting marshmallows at us haha Nate said can't wait to give this as a gift I tested it and it is fun and works great Nate I think anything that goes in your mouth you probably shouldn't test first before gifting it but you do you boom there we go now there are some more good reviews but there is one negative review from Brian he said this item failed to impress the marshmallows don't shoot further than 3 ft if that my kiddo was very underwhelmed I do not recommend this item well Brian I'm about to put that to the test 3 ft measured out got to load up my marshmallow shooter and here we go 3 2 oh that was way way farther than 3 ft 10 ft oh hit the truck 20 ft oh easy wow this thing is epic now did I get carried away and make an upgraded version of the marshmallow shooter the answer is yes yes I did and I'm proud of it it was awesome I thoroughly enjoyed using it definitely a unique use for plumbing pipe but I'm I'm all about it this is more fun than weird oh here's something I didn't know yesterday for $34 you can own your very own baby pet rock this little guy comes with an adoption certificate a baby bottle and even a bed of moss and oh would you look at that a nice patch of moss I also happen to have this perfect little tin for it so I harvested some Moss put it in the tin and the actual baby rock on Etsy is made out of polymer clay but I don't have any so I just found an actual rock drew a face on it and now to move him into his cozy new home and voila there he is my little baby pet rock I know that I said the allseen lemon was the weirdest thing I've ever made but uh this this is a close second but I'm now a proud dad of this little guy I love you what the,1,The video transcript does not

he always waves to you guys every time he's on camera okay hi everybody Drew here from alone Fox and today we have a video all about creating high impact design choices in your home on a budget but these are also clever ways to make those design decisions over the years I have designed and made over many spaces myself as you guys have seen here on the channel and I've definitely come across many different kind of design choices that I've done where I'm like wow that really created such a high impact look and I barely spent anything to do it I went through so many of my videos this weekend and I picked out 10 tips that I think are the biggest high impact most budget friendly tips that you yourself can do in your house starting today if you'd like so let's go ahead and dive on into our first my first tip is one that actually was seen in my hallway makeover and in my hallway I really wanted to create high impact because it was a space that was really Bland and boring it's kind of a transition between the bedrooms and living rooms and the bathrooms and I thought painting the doors kind of an accent color in this space would give it all the life that it needed and that is exactly what I did which actually was a super affordable yet high impact change that I did in this room it's a budget friendly way to add more color and a little bit more injection of kind of design and style into a room doors are also Alo kind of larger surface spaces so I think you get more of a high impact look when you create that contrast color on those doors or like you add an accent color or a pop of color on doors or built-ins whatever it might be that is tip number one this next one actually happens to be in my bedroom and one that I feel like has been trending this year for sure and that is accent ceilings the great thing about accent ceilings is it kind of utilizes a Supply in our last tip which is paint and I will say paint is definitely on the more affordable side for the impact you can create because paint is something that can completely change the mood the vibe of truly anything so in my bedroom I added this accent color of like a golden mustard to the ceiling and then I did a border on the underside of these Navy Stripes which totally are not necessary but I do think adding this accent ceiling to this room as opposed to just keeping it all this kind of creamy color that's on the walls really adds that high impact look and feel and kind of designer touch as well and it was something that was super super easy to achieve bringing the ceiling color down on the wall a little bit as well also kind of gives the illusion that you have taller ceiling there really is a lot you can do with paint that creates a different vibe a different mood or just like a different feeling in the space one of my absolute favorite tips that I will give credit to Justin for because he is someone that taught me this he actually I don't know if you guys know he used to work on that show homework on the Magnolia Network and when he was on that show they stacked baseboards and I thought that that was such a genius idea guess personally I will say a lot of older homes the baseboards just are not cute something about old houses I never love the baseboards I always think an old home could use a new baseboard I always love the crown molding I love the wall molding the window trim everything but normally the baseboards are just a little chintzy an older home or even new builds when they go the more chintzy route but something you can always do to elevate a baseboard because baseboards are super costly is just stack another piece of molding or trim on top paint it the same exact color you can add some caulking in between if you need to to make them feel more like one but you can even stack multiple pieces of molding or trim so you don't even have to get rid of or remove your original baseboard just stack right on top of it paint it in and nobody's going to know that that is not one piece of trim that you applied on the walls so I think that is such a genius hack to keep in mind because there's been so many projects where I've actually gone in in the past and pulled out the baseboards to put in something that looks worse than if I was to just stack a more affordable piece of trim on top and just paint it all together so a great little tip to keep in mind my fourth tip is all about using molding to your advantage and really thinking outside of the box on how you can use the different pieces of molding you could find at hardware stores the little corner pieces like the little molding corner pieces that you can find as well I feel like the one we can all think of is just your traditional French kind of panel molding which I've done so many times on the channel in the past but something I did actually in my living room was I used a little rosettes that you could find just at Lowe's and I stacked them across the entire top of the built-in bookshelves that I did on my back wall and once this was all painted together it totally gave the look that this was completely custom it could have even been like somewhat original to the home at the time period I just definitely feel like there are ways to utilize molding and molding really does give you that high impact luxury feel and it doesn't have to cost that much this one is all about using painters tape to actually create designs before going in and painting and I'm not talking about going crazy with your designs I'm going to give you two iterations where one's a little bit more simple and I think a little bit more attainable and then one's a little bit more crazy you might have seen that one if you actually watch my YouTube shorts I just shared it the other day but in my previous apartment I actually used painters tape on the underside of an arch to create like this striped border and I really feel like this created such a high impact focal point in the space like it's always what people talk about when they reference this photo but something I've done recently actually is I diagn striped my entire breakfast nook I literally covered the entire breakfast nook floor to ceiling and painters tape and you don't have to do a diagonal stripe you can do vertical you can do horizontal but I just feel like stripes are such a classic print that is never ever going to go out of style so I did diagonals in here painted over the top of it and when I pulled off the tape it just revealed this beautiful like almost wallpaper look I definitely think you guys can see that for the price point which I only spent about $30 on the tape and then probably $40 for all the paint as well I spent about $70 on this wall and the impact that it created was far more than the money I think that I spent on it I definitely took a little patience but I love the result I think just incorporating this even in an accent wall or like a kids room or something just keep that in mind that painters tape and just adding stripes or a little detail design to something is a great way to add a little bit more interest before going in and painting it the next up here is probably the one that could be the most costly depending on how you do it but I will say that it definitely is too that I feel like makes the biggest like one of the biggest impacts and that is layering your lighting and what I mean by layering your lighting is adding in additional sources of light um to create a different Ambiance a different mood you can use them at different times of days and for different types of things like for example these ones on the sides of my bed they were not here when I first moved into the space there was just a ceiling light and if you do have an outlet on the wall you're wanting to install let's say some sconces or some ceiling lights it's going to be much more cost effective but I'll say right now that I did pay somebody $400 to come out and install these two electrical boxes on either side of my bed but I will say that the $400 I spent makes this room feel like a hotel and I totally offset that by purchasing some lights from Facebook Marketplace for 30 bucks um if you watched my makeover you guys would have seen these ones and something I will say now is my room feels completely different I do not turn on the overhead light at all at night time I only have these little kind of side side lit nightstand lights on and it creates such an Ambiance and a mood even out in the kitchen there's a lamp that stays on at night time it's actually plugged into a little Alexa plug so at night time that turns on and then we just don't even have to utilize the kitchen lights really thinking about your lighting and layering in an additional option or two is a great way to kind of just add a little bit more impact and it doesn't have to be hardwired because that definitely does cost more it could be even something along the lines of a table lamp or floor lamp that just gives you more option and versatility to your lighting now I definitely know art can be super expensive but I also know that a lot of expensive art looks like it was handmade and so that is something I have tooken into account many times in the past and I create my own DIY artwork all the time a lot of you guys probably know Marco um want Zora on Instagram and Tik Tok he actually blew up over the past couple years but we've been friends for many many years and a a couple years back I actually redid his apartment on my channel before he was creating content in his space I created these really large canvas art pieces and I framed them out in some 1X two pieces of wood it cost me around $150 for both of these large canvases and all the wood and paint that I used but I will say we covered an entire wall like the biggest focal wall in his living room with this art and it created such high impact for probably what would have cost thousands of dollars if you were actually looking from like an art studio or just someone that sold art at the size and caliber we were looking for so just going out to Blick or on Amazon and purchasing yourself a really large canvas and creating your own piece of art is a great way to get large scale art for an entryway a living room a bedroom at a fraction of price point I was also thinking to myself what is always that kind of finishing element that makes a room like shine in my opinion and it always is a plant to me like I always feel like that little bit of organic and that little bit of nature just brings a room to life it really does and in the lobby downstairs which is kind of like the second living room I call it the lobby space I actually got a tree for $50 on Facebook Market place and my tip here is to actually utilize Facebook Marketplace to find yourself a gorgeous plant because there are so many people getting rid of house plants whether they be moving to a new state they've grown them for a while they just don't want to take care of them anymore there are a lot of great great large scale plants on Facebook Marketplace that you could find for such a great price point and they are going to create the biggest impact in your home I promise you because when I brought this Fus in that was in someone's yard they sold it to us for $50 just added so much mood movement to the space it almost looked sculptural it added a breath of fresh air to the room like it just really transformed the room in every single room I do there's always always always a plant so I think I would say that if you're looking for like a large scale or focal plant for a space definitely check out Facebook Marketplace because you can get one for a fraction of the price that's going to create a lovely high impact look in your space tip number nine is all about refinishing furniture and this is something that I do all the time and I have shared so many different DIY tutorials on like the one in my bedroom I want to focus kind of on this one because I actually turned this instead of stripping it because stripping Furniture can honestly be such a pain I actually painted this one to look like wood and I just adore the way that it ended up turning out I'll go ahead and Link the tutorial for this one but I've also shared tutorials in the past on how to bleach Furniture so if you want to take the wood back to a natural state and also how to strip Furniture to give it more of an age primitive look number 10 you guys is one that you've probably heard in the past and this is swapping out light fixtures but kind of going back to our last one too is that I have swapped out so many light fixtures in this home with ones I found on Facebook Marketplace for such a reasonable price point I feel like one of the most notable ones is the one in my dining room because I got this like massive overarching iron chandelier that is perfect for a table I got it for $150 on Marketplace and swapping out the slight fixture for the one that was there just completely transformed this room a light fixture too it's like the jewelry of a room it's like the focal point when you walk in it's what you see so I definitely say if there's one thing to splurge just a little bit more on it would be a light fixture because it really is the focal it is a center point of any single room and swapping in a light fixture can create high impact in a space extremely easily and that guys concludes today's video I hope that you enjoyed this one and those are my 10 budget friendly and most inexpensive but most high impact ways to transform a space and I hope that you guys can't hear that I mean you probably can they're building a home next door they've been building it for like a year I think I've mentioned it they're still not done and um yeah they're just taking their time so hopefully soon they'll be done but I hope that one two or maybe even 10 of these will be useful for you when you go to design your next space or if you go to transform your bedroom whatever it might be help a friend out with theirs and I'd love to know in the comment section below which one of these tips was your absolute favorite and if you have any tips for high impact changes you can make to your space that are on the more budget friendly side because I definitely think there are a bunch of high impact changes you can make but if

they've chosen me why specifically me why this you know why why could it possibly be the interesting mixture of Hands-On Parish experience and urban media experience sort of good-looking but in a nonf frightening approachable way an unquenchable optimism Allied to a fundamental can do attitude could it possibly be [Music] that yes along with my great humility of course yes yes that too [Music] yeah Bishop Bishop Bishop charal Bishop charal calm down hello Geraldine graer reporting for Bishop Duty yes hi I mean why not God do you mind oh my goodness I've got to sorry I can't resist this what do you think Su you sir any idea why I was chosen I have no idea it's I mean I told each candidate has their special qualities I mean how did they finally decide on little old Geraldine I mean maybe you mean how will they finally decide sorry oh please come in hello Reverend Mavis Pipkin here about the post of woman Bishop okay oh um am I late has the position already been filled oh no we do that after the interviews that's we've always done it like that sorry interviews yeah hello hello will you be wearing that during the inter no no probably not no no to tell you the truth I have been dreading today I sometimes wonder why I put myself through all this well don't then just go home now I think we both know they're not going to pick me no very good of you I think I they're going to pick Alysia who the hell is Alysia hi oh Alysia I lovely to see you hello M I thought you'd be here I would like to be interviewed as soon as possible please I don't have all day I'm sorry I think they were planning to see you last I'm afraid and Jesus said the first should be last and the last she be first problem solved who are you um I'm jine Granger Booker of DIY and sometime presenter of religious documentaries I don't know if you saw Granger in the manger no thank God and you are here what representing the the younger generation are you um well yes I don't think it would hurt for the church to have a little bit of a spring in its step I mean don't get me wrong I have massive respect for you rugged old Warriors who fought the good fight way back in the early days you know before electricity but you know wouldn't it be wonderful if us youngsters could bring in your whole new generation of people to the joys of Christ true true true yes well maybe you are the one no no well yes yes I would represent youth if called upon to do so come in ah the actual youth representative oh I'm I'm not the youngest am I yeah I think you might be yeah sure they'll choose one of you older more experienced ones we're all so grateful for how you grizzled oldtimers fought the good fight back in the early days we don't really know what they're looking for youth experience or fabulous feistiness I beg your pardon well you know I'm just trying to understand the field here and what have we got we've got callow youth here we have exhausted old age perhaps they're looking for a little bit of ballsiness you know a little bit of energy little bit of zest and zeit gist well C me out I ran out of BS quite a long time ago I'm not sure I ever had any no cuz you're sort of quiet pretty type aren't you it's lovely but I'd love a feisty Bishop you know going on question time protesting in the streets bringing the battle to the man Bishop who's funny not just sort of funny looking I beg

[Music] Theories.com. What's up, guys? Welcome to this video. This is going to be a very concise video. I'm going to make some separate ones as well that will go into great detail on a few subject matters that I want to discuss and like dive further into. But for the most part, this will give you a rundown as well as myself as to all of the stuff that's been announced in the last day for Star Wars Celebration Japan, which has been a decent amount. But really, there's some stuff that I'm excited about, some stuff I could care less about, and uh we're going to go through it. So, Celebration Japan 2025 is here, and we have all the news you need to know. So, the first thing, Friday, April 18th, 2025, Star Wars Starf Fighter comes to theaters on May 28th, 2027. So, if you haven't seen this, it's just this. That's literally it. It's just it's it's just like a title screen says Starf Fighter coming May 28th, 2027. I'm going to release a video on that. If you've seen it, great. If not, uh I dive more into detail. Essentially starring Ryan Gosling. and it's going to be directed by Sean Levy who did Wolverine and Deadpool. The next bit of news is uh Pedro Pascal, Sigourney Weaver, John Favro, and a few special friends came together to celebrate The Mandalorian and Grou during the Star Wars Celebration Japan. And uh The Mandalorian Grou comes to theaters next year, May 22nd, 2026. So about a year and a month away. Um I watched the leaked trailer, which I saw Dash also reacted to, but he got everything got blocked by Disney. So, um, we're not going to do that. But I will tell you, I watched it, and it pains me to say this. I love The Mandalorian season 1 and two, three, really did not like it. Uh, this movie, unless they're hiding some massive big reveal, it looked pretty boring. Like, it looked like he's just, you know, it literally looked like a filler episode. You know, he's just going through different pucks, different bounties, this and that. And then eventually uh you know at the very end was the moment where the crowd cheered like crazy after the credits kind of where Jabba's son is in a gladiator arena and he's got his hands you know like this. Now I did a video a long time ago about Graas the jacked hut full life explained. It's a 9 and a half minute video uploaded about 3 to four years ago and it's got about 200,000 views now. So, you can definitely go check it out if you want to learn about Graas. However, they clearly made Jabba's son jacked and a gladiator. I don't know where that's going to go. You know, if that's really the most important like intriguing thing about the Mandalorian Grou, I feel like, you know, we're really missing the mark. How did we get to, you know, season 1 and two being so amazing to season 3 being so lackluster and rushed and all over the place and not focusing on Mando and Grou than this, which just seems like, you know, one of those filler episodes in a season where you're like, ""Okay, it's just another mission, you know, whatever. What are we going to learn? What's it going to tie into?"" like and and why would they be holding so much information if it is really interesting where it dives into perhaps uh where Luke could be at this time, what he's doing, what they're going to do with him, uh SOA, Boba, and so much more where we could have a endgame kind of scenario which would at least be a little more interesting than them just running off in the galaxy doing their own thing and like looking for bounties. I mean, it just seems like we've had that a lot. I'm not interested. It doesn't really seem that exciting off the bat, you know. Mandalorian season 1 and two trailers had me pumped. This I was like, ""Okay, we've seen this already, right? Dopamine fatigue."" The Mandalorian and Grou shared a first look at the beloved duo and a brand new character. The anticipated adventure begins only in theaters May 22, 2026. Uh Lucasfilm Animation took a look back and a look forward by announcing Star Wars Maul Shadow Lord. I have a video just on that. Pretty damn excited for that. Actually, that is the one and only thing that has stood out so far. Light and Magic second season is ready to watch on Disney Plus. And uh this is actually a really brilliant show documentary. It goes over all of George's accomplishments with ILM and everything that he did so that we have movies edited the way they are today and and George changed the world in so many different ways. Uh linear editing is because of George. So, if you want to see a cool documentary, uh, Light and Magic, second season is on Disney Plus, and I highly recommend the first one. I haven't seen the second one yet, obviously. New covers were revealed for upcoming Star Wars manga novels, novels, art books, and the conclusion to phase three of the High Republic. You know, the High Republic, I read 30 pages and I got really bored. I was just like, I'm not really into this. You know, why wouldn't they just go Old Republic? But the manga is there. You might as want to watch it, read it, whatever. Manga adaptations of Timothy Zhan's 2017 novel Star Wars Thrawn and the Star Wars Jedi Fall in Order are just some of the exciting reveals from the panel. It's nice that they haven't forgot about Calstus. Definitely want to see the game revealed or at least some trailer or something which maybe we'll get um today. Um the anime and manga pavilion is a celebration of collaboration. Not only can attendees see traditional Japanese art featuring the characters of Star Wars Visions uh DLC do no one's playing that game anyways. Uh, Monopoly Go, Star Wars is ready to roll on May 1st. All right, we got some Lego stuff announced. Uh, Jedi Adventures New Season, and then there is a new game for VR. To be honest, the only VR game, Star Wars game that I really recommend is Vader Immortal 1, 2, and 3. I played those games a lot. They're all up on the channel. You can go and see my full playthrough of me in the VR. Like, I got the camera rolling and plus my game footage uh on the other side of the screen. It's actually pretty entertaining. So, you can check that out if you haven't already. But that's pretty much it. There isn't really much else. Hayden Christensen has been confirmed for Ahsoka season 2. But beyond that, nothing really big. Like, the only impressive thing to me so far has been the mall show coming next year in 2026. That's it. But besides that, I mean, there's literally nothing. But until then, let me know if you're excited for anything. Let me know if you just simply don't care, if you're uninterested, or you know what you're waiting for to happen. And of course, it's Vader episode 2. If you haven't seen the trailer, we just dropped the teaser the other day, and uh we're doing the biggest sale that we've ever done on theories.com to help support everything. So, have a great day, everyone. Thanks so much for watching today's video. I'll see you in the next one. Until then, remember, the force will be with you always.",2,The video transcript primarily discusses the presenter's opinions and reactions to various Star Wars announcements and trailers.

(♪♪) >> Adrienne: THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. >>> DURING MOST OF THIS FEDERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN RELATIVELY QUIET ABOUT CANADA, THE DRAMA OF TARIFFS AND THE THREATS OF ANNEXATION -- ALMOST ABSENT. UNTIL TONIGHT. HE MUSED THAT TARIFFS ON CANADA'S AUTO SECTOR MIGHT GO UP, THAT THE GOAL WAS TO EFFECTIVELY END CAR MANUFACTURING IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT WITHOUT THE MONEY EARNED FROM TRADE WITH THE U.S. THAT CANADA WOULD CEASE TO EXIST. THAT'S RIGHT -- MORE RHETORIC ABOUT BECOMING THE 51ST STATE. NOW TRUMP DID SAY THAT HE LOVED THE CANADIAN PEOPLE, BUT AS KATIE SIMPSON SHOWS US, HIS APPARENT GRIEVANCES ABOUT THE COUNTRY ITSELF HAVEN'T GONE ANYWHERE. >> President Trump: HELLO, EVERYBODY. >> Reporter: U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAD LARGELY TONED DOWN HIS ATTACKS ON CANADA FOR MUCH OF THE CANADIAN ELECTION, UNTIL NOW AS HE DELIVERED A NEW TARIFF THREAT. >> President Trump: I REALLY DON'T WANT CARS FROM CANADA. SO WHEN I PUT TARIFFS ON CANADA, THE 25%, THAT COULD GO UP IN TERMS OF CARS. >> Reporter: THERE IS ALREADY A 25% TARIFF ON ALL FOREIGN-MADE AUTO, BUT CUSMA COMPLIANT GOODS ARE EXEMPT FOR NOW. AND THERE IS ALSO BORDER SECURITY TARIFFS OF 25% ON ALL GOODS WITH A LOWER 10% ON ENERGY AND POTASH. AGAIN, CUSMA COMPLIANT GOODS ARE ALSO EXEMPT. AND THERE'S THE GLOBAL 25% TARIFFS ON STEEL AND ALUMINUM. >> President Trump: WE DON'T REALLY WANT CANADA TO MAKE CARS FOR US, IT PUT IT BLUNTLY. WE WANT TO MAKE OUR OWN CARS. >> Reporter: DURING AN OVAL OFFICE EVENT, TRUMP REVISITED SOME OF HIS FAVOURITE COMPLAINTS ABOUT CANADA -- INCLUDING HIS EXAGGERATED CLAIMS ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE TRADE DEFICIT AND SUPPORT THE U.S. PROVIDES TO ITS ALLY. >> President Trump: WHY ARE WE DOING THAT? AND I HAVE TO BE HONEST, BECAUSE AS A STATE, IT WORKS GREAT. AS A NATION, CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT MOST OF THE NATION -- YOU KNOW, 95% OF CANADA WHAT THEY DO IS THEY BUY FROM US AND THEY SELL TO US. IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE US AND WE DIDN'T SPEND THAT MONEY AS TRUDEAU TOLD ME THEY WOULD CEASE TO EXIST. >> Reporter:THIS IS IN LINE WITH WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY TOLD CBC NEWS DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE LAST WEEK. >> HE BELIEVES THAT CANADIANS WOULD BENEFIT GREATLY FROM BECOMING THE 51ST STATE. >> Reporter: WHILE TRUMP'S MESSAGE ON CANADA REMAINS THE SAME HE'S MADE PLENTY OF CONFUSING STATEMENTS ABOUT HIS GLOBAL TRADE WAR. JOURNALISTS URGENTLY SEEKING CLARITY AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY. AS HE PUSHES AHEAD WITH HIS EVER EVOLVING PLAN. >> President Trump: WE'RE NO LONGER GOING TO BE THE COUNTRY THAT'S RIPPED OFF BY EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. >> Reporter: AT THIS POINT THERE'S NO OFFICIAL WORD FROM THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT A FORMAL CHANGE TO THE TARIFF POLICY ON CANADA. SO RIGHT NOW IT IS STATUS QUO. THIS REMAINS YET ANOTHER THREAT FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP. >> Adrienne: AND, KATIE, I WAS JUST THINKING -- IT'S BEEN A BIT OF A WHILE SINCE TRUMP HAS SIGNALED OUT CANADA LIKE THIS? >> Reporter: YEAH, AND IT CERTAINLY WASN'T AS HARSH AS WE'VE HEARD HIM IN THE PAST. HE DID MENTION FORMER PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU SAYING THAT HE AFFECTIONATELY CALLED HIM GOVERNOR AND SAID THAT HE'D HAD A POSITIVE CONVERSATION WITH THE NEW PRIME MINISTER MARK CARNEY. BUT, AGAIN, THIS MOMENT SERVES AS A REMINDER OF TRUMP'S ULTIMATE GOAL AND HE'S TRYING TO GROW JOBS IN THE U.S., EVEN AT THE EXPENSE OF A LONG-TIME ALLY. >> Adrienne:ALL RIGHT, KATIE SIMPSON IN WASHINGTON. >>> AS THE FEDERAL CAMPAIGN ENTERS ITS FINAL DAYS CONSERVATIVE LEADER PIERRE POILIEVRE TOOK AIM AT TENT ENCAMPMENTS, SAYING THAT HE'D GIVE POLICE THE POWER TO DISMANTLE THEM AND ARREST THE OCCUPANTS. EVAN DYER HAS THE REACTION. >> Pierre Poilievre: IT'S LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION. >> Reporter: THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER TODAY PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE CRIMINAL CODE THAT WOULD MAKE IT AN OFFENCE TO SET UP A TENT IN A PUBLIC SPACE AND GIVE POLICE THE POWER TO DISMANTLE ENCAMPMENTS. >> Pierre Poilievre: ENCAMPMENTS NOW FILL SPACES WHERE CHILDREN ONCE PLAYED AND FAMILIES ONCE GATHERED. OUR PUBLIC SPACES HAVE BECOME A BREEDING GROUND FOR ADDICTION AND VIOLENCE AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND CRIME. >> Reporter: SINCE THE PANDEMIC, CITIES LARGE AND SMALL AROUND CANADA HAVE REPORTED A GROWTH IN THE NUMBER AND THE SIZE OF HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS. EVEN WHERE SHELTERS EXIST, THEY TYPICALLY DON'T ALLOW PEOPLE TO STAY INDEFINITELY. ONE REASON THAT SARAH SAYS THAT SHE'S CAMPING OUT IN HULL, QUÉBEC. >> 30 DAYS IN AND SEVEN DAYS OUT. AND DURING THE SEVEN DAYS OUT, I CAMP IN MY TENT AND I FREEZE MY ASS. >> Reporter: EVEN IN THE MIDDLE OF A WINTER? >> YEP, DON'T HAVE A CHOICE, RIGHT? >> Reporter: POILIEVRE WOULD PURSUE A HOUSING FIRST STRATEGY. >> Pierre Poilievre: WE WILL GIVE PEOPLE THAT ARE CURRENTLY TRAPPED IN THESE AWFUL CIRCUMSTANCES A PATHWAY TO A BETTER LIFE. >> Reporter:ON THAT PART OF THE PLAN HE PRESENTED FEW DETAILS. AND THE OTHER PARTIES PANNED HIS APPROACH. >> Jagmeet Singh: HE WANTS TO CHARGE PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS. HE WANTS TO CRIMINALIZE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO LIVE. TRACKS FOR CONSERVATIVES. WE WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE HOMES. >> Mark Carney: IT'S A TYPICAL AMERICAN-STYLE APPROACH TO AN ISSUE WHICH PIERRE POILIEVRE HAS IMPORTED, WHICH IS THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM -- I WILL ARREST PEOPLE. I WILL CRIMINALIZE IT.

EXACTLY? TO LEAVE WHERE? WHERE DO YOU WANT ME TO GO? >> Reporter: ANY NEW LAW ON HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS MIGHT FACE A CHARTER CHALLENGE. THE SUPREME COURT HAS ALREADY RULED THAT DEMOLISHING A CAMP WHEN SHELTERS DON'T HAVE ROOM TO HOUSE THE PEOPLE IN IT VIOLATES THE CHARTER RIGHTS TO LIFE, LIBERTY AND SECURITY OF THE PERSON. EVAN DYER, CBC NEWS, OTTAWA. >> Adrienne: THE LIBERALS AND BLOC QUEÉBÉCOIS ARE ALSO LOOKING TO SHORE UP SUPPORT IN THESE FINAL DAYS OF THE ELECTION. CBC NEWS IS TRAVELING WITH THE CAMPAIGN. SO FIRST WE TAKE YOU TO B.C. >> Reporter: I'M ASHLEY BURKE COVERING THE LIBERAL CAMPAIGN. LEADER MARK CARNEY IS BACK IN B.C. TARGETING A HANDFUL OF N.D.P. AND CONSERVATIVE RIDINGS THAT HIS PARTY WANTS TO TURN RED. CARNEY CALLED ON VOTERS OF ALL POLITICAL STRIPES TO VOTE FOR HIM REGARDLESS OF WHO THEY'VE SUPPORTED IN THE PAST. AND EXCLUSIVELY TOOK AIM AT HIS MAIN RIVAL PIERRE POILIEVRE. CARNEY WAS ASKED ABOUT BARELY MENTIONING THE N.D.P. THIS CAMPAIGN AND HE JOKED THAT TODAY COULD BE THE FIRST TIME. THE LIBERAL LEADER SAYS THAT THIS ELECTION COMES DOWN TO ONE ISSUE -- WHO IS BEST TO TAKE ON DONALD TRUMP. AND HE SAYS THAT THERE ARE ONLY TWO CHOICES -- POILIEVRE OR HIM. >> Reporter: I'M RAFFY BOUDJIKANIAN IN SAINTE-THERESE ON MONTRÉAL'S NORTH SHORE, WHERE BLOC QUEÉBEÉCOIS LEADER YVES-FRANÇOIS BLANCHET IS GREETING POTENTIAL VOTERS. HE COULD LOSE UP TO 10 SEATS INCLUDING THIS RIDING. BLANCHET ALSO VISITED TWO OTHER THAT ARE BLOC TERRITORIES EARLIER TODAY AND HE SPENT MOST OF THIS WEEK PLAYING DEFENCE. STILL BLANCHET HAS COME BACK FROM BEHIND IN BOTH OF THE LAST TWO FEDERAL ELECTIONS AND HE INSISTS THAT QUÉBECERS COULD STILL GIVE HIS PARTY A GIFT COME MONDAY. BUT THE CLOCK IS TICKING AS HE TRIES TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PULL OFF A HAT TRICK. >> Adrienne: THE N.D.P. IS FIGHTING TO HOLD ONTO ITS SEAT IN A CAMPAIGN FILLED WITH CHALLENGES. MARINA VON STACKELBERG SHOWS US THE CHANGE IN MESSAGING INTENDED TO TURN THINGS AROUND. >> Jagmeet Singh:ARE WE READY TO KEEP ON KNOCKING ON DOORS? >> Reporter: JAGMEET SINGH HAS RENEWED ENERGY IN WHAT IS NOW A BATTLE FOR THE N.D.P.'S FUTURE. >> Jagmeet Singh: WE HAVE FIVE DAYS LEFT. I DIDN'T HEAR ANY BELL. DID YOU GUYS HEAR A BELL? THIS FIGHT IS NOT OVER. WE'RE HERE FIGHTING EVERY SINGLE DAY. >> Reporter: POLLS SUGGEST THAT THE NEW DEMOCRATS COULD LOSE MANY OF THEIR 24 SEATS AND THEY MAY EVEN FALL BELOW OFFICIAL PARTY STATUS IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, SO SINGH IS ON THE DEFENSIVE, AND HE'S VISITING RIDINGS THAT THE N.D.P. ALREADY HAS. EVEN PARTS OF B.C. THAT SHOULD BE STRONGHOLDS. AND HE HAS CHANGED HIS MESSAGE. >> Jagmeet Singh: WHETHER MARK CARNEY GETS A SUPER MAJORITY OR WHETHER THERE'S ENOUGH NEW DEMOCRATS TO PARLIAMENT TO HOLD THE LINE. >> Reporter: BUT IN MUCH OF WESTERN CANADA, THE FIGHT IS BETWEEN ORANGE AND BLUE. SOME N.D.P. INCUMBENTS WON THEIR RIDINGS LAST ELECTION BY A SMALL MARGIN. >> THE ONLY WAY TO BEAT THE CONSERVATIVES IS TO VOTE N.D.P., THAT'S COMING UP OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WE'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD CHANCE OF THIS IF WE GET ENOUGH PEOPLE OUT TO THE POLLS. >> WE HAVE A RECORD NUMBER OF VOLUNTEERS AND WE'VE NEVER HAD MORE RESOURCES THAN WE'VE EVER HAD. >> Reporter:BUT SUPPORTERS SAY THAT THEY ARE WORRIED THAT VOTERS WON'T CHOOSE THE N.D.P. >> PEOPLE ARE SO SCARED IF THEY DON'T WANT THE CONSERVATIVES TO GET IN, THEY THINK THAT THE ONLY OPTION, UM, IS TO VOTE LIBERAL. >> I KNOW A LOT OF LEFT-WING VOTERS THAT ARE VERY DISENFRANCHISED WITH THE N.D.P. >> Reporter:THE NEW DEMOCRATS HAVE STRUGGLED TO BE PART OF THE TARIFF CONVERSATION. AND THIS EXPERT SAYS THAT THE PARTY HAS BAGGAGE. >> THE WHOLE SITUATION WITH THE N.D.P. AND THE DECLINE OF THE PARTY HAS BEEN IN MOTION FOR SOME TIME NOW. I THINK THAT EVER SINCE THEY DECIDED TO SIGN ON THE AGREEMENT OF CONFIDENCE AND SUPPLY WITH THE LIBERALS THEY'VE HAD A REALLY HARD TIME DIFFERENTIATING THEMSELVES. >> Reporter: SINGH IS NOW IN WINNIPEG, FIGHTING TO SAVE ANOTHER SEAT. THE RIDING OF ELMWOOD-TRANSCONA, A WORKING-CLASS SUBURBAN AREA HAS ALMOST ALWAYS VOTED N.D.P. BUT IN A BY-ELECTION LAST YEAR, THE NEW DEMOCRATS ONLY HELD ON TO IT BY A SLIM MARGIN. MARINA VON STACKELBERG, CBC NEWS, WINNIPEG. >> Adrienne: JUST AHEAD, WE WILL ASK TWO LEADING POLL ANALYSTS WHAT THEY'RE SEEING IN THE LATEST NUMBERS AND WHICH BATTLE GROUNDS COULD SWING RESULTS. >>> A REMINDER THAT CBC HAS YOU COVERED ON ELECTION NIGHT. YOU CAN JOIN US FOR MINUTE-BY-MINUTE UPDATES ON MONDAY AS POLLS CLOSE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. OUR ""CANADA VOTE"" COVERAGE BEGINS AT 6:30 P.M. EASTERN/3:30 P.M. PACIFIC WHEREVER YOU WATCH CBC NEWS. >>> THE HUDSON'S BAY IS MOVING TO CLOSE THE SIX LOCATIONS THAT IT WAS ATTEMPTING TO SAVE. A NEW COURT FILING CONFIRMS THAT THOSE STORES WHICH ARE IN ONTARIO AND QUEÉBEC, WILL BEGIN LIQUIDATION SALES THIS FRIDAY. THE DECISION COMES AFTER FAILED ATTEMPT TO FIND AN INVESTOR AND RESTRUCTURE. NOW ALL 96 LOCATIONS ARE SET TO CLOSE BY JUNE 15TH. BUT THE COMPANY SAYS THAT IT WILL REVERSE COURSE IF A BUYER SURFACES. >>> AND THE CROWN HAS DELIVERED ITS OPENING ARGUMENT IN THE SEX ASSAULT TRIAL OF FIVE FORMER WORLD JUNIOR HOCKEY PLAYERS. KATIE NICHOLSON NOW ON THE ALLEGATIONS BEING MADE AND THE EVIDENCE THAT COULD BE PRESENTED IN THE DAYS AHEAD. >> Reporter: A LONG WALK TO THE COURTHOUSE AND AN EVEN LONGER SEVEN-YEAR JOURNEY TO THIS DAY. AS THE CROWN OUTLINED ITS CASE AGAINST FIVE FORMER JUNIOR WORLD STARS ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. MICHAEL McLEOD AND DILLON DUBÉ AND CAL FOOTE AND ALEX FORMENTON AND CARTER HART ALL HAVE PLEADED NOT GUILTY. IT WAS JUNE 2018, THE PLAYERS LEFT A HOCKEY GALA FOR A BAR, WHERE McLEOD MET A WOMAN WHOSE NAME IS PROTECTED BY A PUBLICATION BAN. McLEOD TOOK HER TO HIS HOTEL, ROOM 209, AND THEY HAD SEX. THEN THE CROWN SAID THAT THE ATMOSPHERE CHANGED. THE CROWN SAYS THAT HE THEN TEXTED TEAMMATES. WHO WANTS TO BE IN A THREE-WAY -- QUICK. 209, MIKEY. THE CROWN LAID OUT GRAPHIC AND SPECIFIC SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS AGAINST EACH PLAYER. ONLY McLEOD FACES A SECOND CHARGE, BEING PARTY TO THE OFFENCE. THE CROWN SAYS THAT IT HAS EVIDENCE THAT HE ASSISTED AND ENCOURAGED HIS TEAMMATES TO ENGAGE SEXUALLY WITH THE WOMAN, KNOWING THAT SHE HAD NOT CONSENTED. CONSENT, WHAT IT IS AND WHAT IT'S NOT -- THE MAIN THRUST OF THE CROWN'S OPENING STATEMENT. THIS LONG-TIME CRIMINAL DEFENCE LAWYER SAYS THAT CAN BE TRICKY TO PROVE. >> SO THE ISSUE IS, WAS THERE SPECIFIC CONSENT FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THESE MEN TO PARTICIPATE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WITH THE -- WITH THE COMPLAINANT? >> Reporter: THE CROWN SAYS THAT ITS EVIDENCE WILL INCLUDE VIDEOS FROM THAT NIGHT AND MESSAGES BETWEEN THE PLAYERS AND THE AFTERMATH MAKING SURE THEIR ACCOUNTS MATCHED UP. MUCH OF THE CASE WILL HANG ON THE TESTIMONY OF THE THEN 20-YEAR-OLD WOMAN AT THE HEART OF THIS CASE. BUT SHE WON'T BE THE ONLY KEY WITNESS. THE CROWN SAYS THAT IT INTENDS TO CALL OTHER TEAMMATES WHO WERE IN ROOM 209 THAT NIGHT TO TESTIFY. >> Adrienne:AND, KATIE, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THERE WAS AN UNEXPECTED DELAY IMMEDIATELY AFTER TODAY'S LUNCH BREAK? >> Reporter: YES. WE WERE EXPECTING LONDON POLICE DETECTIVE TO CONTINUE TESTIMONY AND SOMETHING HAPPENED. I'M NOT ALLOWED TO TELL YOU THE DETAILS OF WHAT HAPPENED, BUT IT REQUIRED THE JUDGE TO SPEAK WITH THE LAWYERS WITHOUT THE JURY PRESENT. THE JURY WAS SENT HOME AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE JURY IS EXPECTED BACK HERE AGAIN TOMORROW. >> Adrienne: OKAY, INTERESTING. KATIE NICHOLSON IN LONDON, ONTARIO, THANK YOU. >>> POLICE IN HAMILTON, ONTARIO HAVE TRACKED DOWN TWO CARS THAT WERE INVOLVED IN THE DEADLY SHOOTING OF AN INNOCENT BY-STANDER.

SO WE ARE VERY, VERY MOVED. >> WE'RE VERY GLAD THAT WE SEE HIM AND THIS IS A MIRACLE FOR US. >> Reporter: THIS VATICAN CORRESPONDENT SAYS THAT FRANCIS WAS VERY INVOLVED IN PLANNING HOW THIS DAY WOULD UNFOLD. >> I THINK THAT THE SIMPLICITY OF HOW FRANCIS WANTED TO BE BURIED, THE FACT THAT HE DIDN'T WANT TO GO THE TRADITIONAL ROUTE, WHERE POPES ARE BURIED IN THREE DIFFERENT COFFINS, HE CHOSE ONE SIMPLE WOODEN ONE INSCRIBED WITH HIS NAME, IT SAYS A LOT TO HIS CHARACTER. >> Reporter: EVEN THOSE WHO DIDN'T GET INTO ST. PETER'S SAID THAT IT FELT LIKE THEY WERE WITNESSING HISTORY, INCLUDING THIS CANADIAN COUPLE FROM WASAGA BEACH, ONTARIO. >> TO BE PART OF THAT MOMENT OF ONE CHAPTER OF THIS POPE HAS ENDED BUT, YOU KNOW, THE HOPE OF A NEW POPE STEPPING IN -- THERE IS SOME OPTIMISM THERE. AND, YOU KNOW, MAYBE WHAT THE NEW POPE WILL STAND FOR. AND, YOU KNOW, THE WORLD IS CHANGING AND IT'S EVOLVING. >> Reporter: FRANCIS' FUNERAL WILL BE ON SATURDAY, FOLLOWED BY THE CONCLAVE TO CHOOSE HIS SUCCESSOR, WHICH MAY STILL BE TWO WEEKS AWAY. CHRIS BROWN, CBC NEWS, ROME. >> Adrienne: CBC NEWS WILL HAVE FULL COVERAGE OF THE POPE'S FUNERAL ON SATURDAY, HOSTED BY HEATHER HISCOX AT THE VATICAN. YOU CAN CATCH THAT ANYWHERE THAT YOU WATCH CBC NEWS STARTING AT 3:00 A.M. EASTERN. >>> WELL, THE SHORTAGE OF FAMILY DOCTORS IS PUSHING MORE CANADIANS TO PAY FOR PRIVATE CARE. >> THESE CLINICS ARE CHARGING BETWEEN $3,000 AND $8,000 A YEAR. >> Adrienne: COMING UP, WHAT SOME EXPERTS ARE CALLING FOR TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC SYSTEM.

THAT WAS THE LOCAL GIRLS HOCKEY CLUB CONFIRMING THAT VANCOUVER WILL BECOME THE FIRST EXPANSION TEAM AND THE SEVENTH FRANCHISE IN THE PWHL JOINING THE LEAGUES NEXT SEASON. FOR NOW THE CLUB WILL BE KNOWN AS PWHL VANCOUVER. THE LEAGUE SAYS THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON DEVELOPING A LOGO AND A NAME. >>> A BIG ISSUE FOR VOTERS IN THIS ELECTION -- SOARING COSTS. TYPICALLY THINGS LIKE RENT AND FOOD TOP THE LIST, BUT IT'S ALSO HEALTHCARE. CHRISTINE BIRAK IS TRACKING THE RISE OF PRIVATE CLINICS NOW CHARGING CANADIANS TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUT OF POCKET FOR MEDICALLY NECESSARY SERVICES. >> Reporter:MOST PATIENTS AT THIS MONTRÉAL-AREA CLINIC DON'T HAVE A FAMILY DOCTOR. THEIR FIRST APPOINTMENT COSTS AT LEAST $350. AFTER THAT -- >> EVERY 15 MINUTES I CAN PAY $150. >> THAT WAS LIKE A BIT OF A STICKER SHOCK. I WAS LIKE WOW. >> Reporter: MARISSA FOUND OUT THAT HER FAMILY DOCTOR OF 10 YEARS LEFT TO WORK IN A FOR-PROFIT CLINIC, OFFERING SAME-DAY OFFICE VISITS, HOUSE CALLS AND ACCESS TO MRIS. >> THIS IS THE HEALTHCARE THAT WE ALL DESERVE. >> Reporter:THE FEE $4,245 A YEAR. >> I ALREADY PAY FOR THIS THROUGH MY TAXES, RIGHT? SO WHY SHOULD I PAY A PRIVATE COMPANY? >> Reporter: THE LATEST FEDERAL DATA SHOWED THAT CANADIANS PAID OVER $62 MILLION OUT OF POCKET FOR NECESSARY SERVICES THEY SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED AT NO COST. DOCTORS SAY THAT COMPANIES ARE USING LOOPHOLES WHILE THE PROVINCES LOOK AWAY. >> THESE CLINICS ARE CHARGING BETWEEN $3,000 AND $8,000 A YEAR. >> Reporter: DR. RITA MCCRAKEN IS A FAMILY DOCTOR IN B.C. SHE GOT A JOB OFFER FROM A PRIVATE CLINIC ESTIMATING THAT SHE COULD DROP 800 PATIENTS, MAKE MORE MONEY AND PAY NO OVERHEAD. SHE SAID NO. >> WHAT IT DOES IS IT TAKES A FAMILY DOCTOR LIKE ME AND REMOVES ME AND PUTS ME BEHIND A PAYROLL. >> I HAVE WORKED IN THE PUBLIC SYSTEM FOR 20 YEARS. >> Reporter: DR. MARTIN POTTER NOW OWNS A PRIVATE CLINIC IN QUÉBEC. UNLIKE MOST PROVINCES QUÉBEC ALLOWS DOCTORS TO BUILD BOTH A PRIVATE SYSTEM AND THROUGH PRIVATE CLINICS. AS MORE DOCTORS GO PRIVATE, AND MORE PATIENTS ARE LOSING ACCESS. NOW QUÉBEC PLANS TO FORCE NEW DOCTORS TO WORK IN THE PUBLIC SYSTEM, NOTING THAT THEIR TRAINING COST TAXPAYERS $400,000 TO $800,000. >> INSTEAD OF FIXING THE REASON WHY PEOPLE HAVE LEFT THE PUBLIC SYSTEM, THEY'RE JUST BASICALLY PREVENTING AN OPTION FOR THESE DOCTORS. >> Reporter: EXPERTS SAY THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN PUSH FOR CHANGE BY PULLING MILLIONS IN FUNDING FROM PROVINCES IF THEY DON'T APPROVE HEALTHCARE FOR EVERYONE -- NOT JUST THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT. CHRISTINE BIRAK, CBC NEWS, TORONTO. >> Adrienne: NOW IT'S TIME TO BREAK DOWN THE STORIES SHAPING OUR WORLD. >>> TONIGHT, THE CHOICE FACING CANADIANS EXAMINED FROM MULTIPLE ANGLES. (♪♪) WHAT OPINION POLLS ARE REALLY TELLING US DAYS FROM THE FINAL VOTE. >> IF THOSE RIDINGS ARE TURNING BLUE ON ELECTION NIGHT THEN MAYBE PIERRE POILIEVRE HAS A CHANCE TO WIN THIS. >> Adrienne: CANADIANS ARE GLUED TO THIS ELECTION. WE ASKED THREE OF THEM ABOUT THEIR MOTIVATION. >> TO HAVE THE CANADIAN DREAM IS WHAT IS AT STAKE RIGHT NOW. >> Adrienne: BUT FIRST THE SECRET ART OF PERSUASION. >> CANDIDATES AND CAMPAIGNS ARE KIND OF LIKE BRANDS. >> Adrienne: HOW STRATEGISTS CRAFT THE IMAGE OF THEIR LEADER AND HOW IT CAN GO SO WRONG. (♪♪) IN THIS FINAL LAP OF THE RACE, VOTERS LIKE YOU ARE PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION IN HUGE NUMBERS. SO THESE SUBTLE TECHNIQUES MAY BE MORE INFLUENTIAL THAN EVER. ALI CHIASSON BREAKS DOWN HOW THEY WORK. >> Reporter: YOU KNOW THAT A LOT OF CAMPAIGN MESSAGING IS SUBLIMINAL. AND BEFORE A CANDIDATE SAYS ANYTHING, THEY'RE TELLING YOU A STORY -- WITH WHAT THEY WEAR, HOW THEY'RE STANDING. AND THE PICTURES THEY POST ON SOCIAL MEDIA. >> EVERY GRANULAR DETAIL IS BLABBED OUT WELL IN ADVANCE. IT WOULDN'T BE OUT OF THE REALM TO HAVE SOME CANDIDATES FOCUS GROUPING THEIR TIES. >> Reporter: THINK OF IT AS AN AESTHETIC WAR ROOM. >> FROM THEIR CLOTHES TO HOW THEY DO THEIR HAIR AND TO THEIR MOVEMENT AND POSTURE. >> Reporter:LET'S DECODE WHAT THE CURRENT FRONT RAIN ARE RUNNERS ARE TRYING TO TELL US, STARTING WITH SLOGANS. >> LOOK AT THE SLOGAN OF CANADA STRONG AND VERSUS CANADA FIRST. AND WE HAD A WORD CHANGE FROM STRONG TO FIRST. WITH THE LIBERALS STRONG, AND WHAT DOES THE WORD STRONG INDICATE? RESISTANCE, RESISTANCE TO PRESSURE, SOMETHING LIKE FIRST, WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPETITIVE. SOMETHING OF SOMEONE BEING PUT AHEAD OF ANOTHER. EACH CAMPAIGN IS SIGNALING A DIFFERENT RESPONSE TO THE PRESSURES FROM THE SOUTH. >> Reporter: AND YOU CAN EVEN SEE THAT IN THEIR LOGOS. >> IF WE LOOK TO THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY, WE SEE A VERY STRONG, VERY CENTRED MAPLE LEAF ENCOMPASSED BY THE C AND IT'S COMING UP OVER THE HORIZON LINE. SO WE'VE GOT THIS LIKE DAWNING OF A NEW DAY. WE HAVE THIS RISING UP OF A PARTY. AND THE LIBERAL PARTY, WE HAVE A MAPLE LEAF THAT IS MUCH MORE ACTIVE. IT'S EMOTION AND IT'S COMPLEMENTARY TO THE STATIC NATURE OF THE LIBERAL WORD MARK AND I CAN SEE THEM LOOKING TO COMMUNICATE AGILITY OR FLEXIBILITY. >> CANDIDATES AND CAMPAIGNS ARE KIND OF LIKE BRANDS. >> Reporter: WITH THEIR POLITICAL BRAND DECIDED, CANDIDATES JUST HAVE TO STICK TO THE THEME -- BE COOL. POLITICAL P.R. STRATEGIST PATRICIA FAVE HAS SOME POINTERS ON THAT. >> THERE WAS A DEBACLE THAT HAS HAUNTED EVERY CAMPAIGN TEAM. >> THEY PUT THEIR LEADER IN A HAIR NET TO TOUR A CHEESE FACTORY AND IT PROVIDED THE STRONGEST IMAGE OF THE CAMPAIGN. QUÉBEC CARTOONISTS HAD A FIELD DAY. A POLITICAL DISASTER. >> DO VISIT THE DAIRY FACILITY. DON'T VISIT THE PARTS THAT REQUIRE YOU TO WEAR A HAIR NET. >> Reporter: CAMPAIGNING IN 2025 -- DO PUT ON A HARD HAT. ANOTHER DO -- APRONS. THERE ISN'T ENOUGH TIME TO RECOVER FROM A BAD VIRAL MOMENT. TAKE IT FROM THE SOCIAL MEDIA LEAD FLASH MEME WORD BEHIND JAGMEET SINGH'S 2019 CAMPAIGN. >> YOU CAN'T FORCE ANYTHING. IF YOU WANT YOUR CANDIDATE TO LEAN INTO SOCIAL TRENDS YOU HAVE TO FIND THE RIGHT ONES. >> YEP. >> NOPE. >> Reporter: THIS MADE SENSE BACK THEN. BUT IN THIS 2025 FEDERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN, THEY ARE ALL PLAYING IT SAFE. JAGMEET IS STILL POSTING GET READY WITH ME, BUT THAT'S PRETTY ON BRAND FOR THE N.D.P. LEADER. >> Jagmeet Singh: VOTE FOR A NEW DEMOCRAT WHO IS GOING TO FIGHT FOR YOU. >> Reporter: THAT WORKED FOR HIS BRAND WHERE MARK CARNEY'S SOCIAL MEDIA TEAM LOVES THE PODIUM AND LOVES THE SUIT. EVEN IN A HOCKEY JERSEY. >> Mark Carney: MIKE MYERS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? >> Reporter:YOU CAN'T MISS THE CALL OUT. >> AND THEY WANT TO SHOW THAT THE ADULTS ARE IN THE ROOM. AND YOU WON'T SEE THEM DO ANYTHING UNSAFE ON SOCIAL THAT PISSES EVERYONE OFF. THEY'RE READY TO SERVE. I THINK THAT IS VERY CLEARLY COMING ACROSS IN THEIR CONTENT. >> Reporter: POILIEVRE'S TEAM PARTICIPATES A FAMILY PORTRAIT. >> COMMON SENSE, LET'S BRING IT HOME. >> THEY'RE DEFINITELY TRYING TO COMMUNICATE A MORE HUMAN VERSION OF PIERRE THAT MAYBE THEY HAVEN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEFINE UP UNTIL THE ELECTION, WITH THE INCLUSION OF HIS PARTNER THAT THEY'RE DOING A GREAT JOB AT. >> Reporter: BUT ALL OF THAT BRAND BUILDING CAN FLY OUT OF THE WINDOW WHEN THERE ARE LIES. >> I THINK THAT YOU JUST HAVE TO TRUST THAT YOU KNOW YOUR MATERIAL. >> Reporter: IMPROV COACH KEN HALL SAW THE CANDIDATES USING OBVIOUS BODY LANGUAGE TECHNIQUES. >> IN ACTING THEY SAY TO PUT THE FOCUS ON SOMEONE. AT TIMES WHERE MARK CARNEY WOULD LOOK VERY TOIC AND NOT REALLY ENGAGE IN A WAY TO MAYBE TO DIMINISH THAT MOMENT. >> BUT YOU CAN GET TOO WRAPPED UP IN TECHNIQUE AND TALKING POINTS, LEAVING NO ROOM FOR PLAY BETWEEN TEAM PARTNERS -- I MEAN CANDIDATES. >> MR. TRUMP WILL BE 90 YEARS OLD, NOT PRESIDENT NO MORE. AND SOMEBODY OF COURSE -- >> I THINK THAT THEY'RE GOING FOR BEERS AFTERWARDS, YOU KNOW? >> Reporter: NOW WAS THAT LAUGHTER GENUINE? OR INTENTIONAL? JUST LIKE THE LOGOS, LOOKS AND FEELS THAT THE CAMPAIGNS CONJURED UP. ONE THING IS FOR SURE, THIS ELECTION HAS GIVEN US A LOT OF MATERIAL TO CONSIDER BEFORE HEADING TO THE POLLS. (♪♪) >> Adrienne: NOW NUMBERS ARE HELPFUL, BUT NOW LET'S HEAR FROM INDIVIDUAL VOTERS WHERE THEY LIVE. NICK PURDON VISITED THREE OF THEM TO ASK ABOUT THEIR HOPES AND FEARS. >> I LOVE OUR COUNTRY. I ALWAYS WILL VOTE. YOU'VE GOTTA VOTE SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE A SAY. >> I REALLY FEEL SORRY FOR WHOEVER BECOMES PRIME MINISTER. >> I FEEL LIKE THIS ELECTION IS BIGGER THAN PROBABLY ANY OTHER ELECTION. >> Reporter: IN A FEW DAYS CANADIANS WILL PICK A NEW GOVERNMENT. ONE OF THE REASONS AND THE HOPES THAT PEOPLE HAVE IN THIS ELECTION -- WHAT ELSE GOES INTO THE BALLOT BOX ALONG WITH A PERSON'S VOTE? I VISITED A FAMILY FARM IN SOUTHERN ALBERTA NEAR THE TOWN OF BLACKIE. LEROY NEWMAN HAS 4,000 ACRES HERE AND CANOLA IS HIS MOST IMPORTANT CROP. DO YOU ALMOST FEEL THAT THE FUTURE OF ALBERTA IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION? >> I WORRY ABOUT SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT THINK THAT WE SHOULD SEPARATE FROM CANADA. I AM A TRUE BELIEVER IN CANADA AND I'M VERY PROUD OF BEING CANADIAN AND I CAN'T SEE OUR PROVINCE GOING ON ITS OWN. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE A CANADIAN ALBERTAN -- IT JUST DOESN'T WORK. SO THE BENEFITS OF THE COWS -- >> Reporter: WHAT IS ON LEROY'S MIND IN THIS ELECTION IS THE FUTURE OF HIS FARM AND KEEPING IT IN THE FAMILY. >> THE FARM -- MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER STARTED IN 1904. I'M THE FOURTH GENERATION AND MY SON IS SOON TO BE THE FIFTH. WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF GOOD TIMES AND A LOT OF BAD TIMES AND WE ALWAYS STUCK THROUGH IT AND STRUGGLED ALONG. IT LOOKS LIKE SHE'S FALLING APART. >> Reporter:LEROY'S PLAN IS FOR HIS SON TO SOON TAKE OVER THE OPERATION HERE. >> IT'S A NEW CONCEPT. >> Reporter: EVEN AS HE WORRIES THAT IT'S GETTING HARDER AND HARDER TO KEEP THE FARMS AFLOAT. >> FOR ME IN THIS ELECTION I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF MEDIUM-SIZED FARMS. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STAY ON THE FARM IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD THESE TAX RATES THAT THEY'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT. BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A REALLY -- A LOT OF INCOME TO KEEP THE FARM GOING. AND IF TAXES GO UP -- WE'RE IN TROUBLE. >> Reporter: WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER? >> LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE ANSWERS FOR YOU. THERE'S PEOPLE THERE THAT WILL HELP YOU, BUT DON'T THINK THAT YOU'RE POWERFUL. YOU'RE HERE TO SERVE US. >> Reporter: WHAT IS THE THING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE THINKING BACK ON YOUR WAY TO VOTE? >> FOR ME ELECTION DAY MEANS THAT THERE WILL BE A LOT OF NERVOUSNESS. I'M THINKING WE HAVE TO KNOW THE NEXT FOUR YEARS OF OUR GOVERNMENT AND WHAT DIRECTION WE CHOOSE TO GO DOWN. I'M QUITE NERVOUS BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN WATCHING THE ONTARIO POLLS CLOSE AND WE'RE DONE. BUT WE ALWAYS MOVE ON. WE GET UP AND WE GET BACK TO THE FARM. PUT YOUR HEAD DOWN AND PAY MORE TAXES. [LAUGHTER] >> Reporter: ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS WINDSOR, ONTARIO, THE TOWN WITH THE BUSIEST BORDER CROSSING IN CANADA. HERE WITH TRUMP'S TRADE WAR -- TARIFFS ARE THE ISSUE. I VISIT DAINTY RICE, CANADA'S ONLY RICE MILL. HERE THEY IMPORT RICE FROM THE U.S. AND THEY SELL IT BACK. SO FAR THE TARIFFS HAVEN'T AFFECTED THEM TOO MUCH, BUT STILL PEOPLE HERE WORRY ABOUT THE FUTURE. WHAT DO YOU GUYS WANT TO CHANGE ABOUT IT? >> WE WANT TO MAKE IT BIGGER. IT FEELS LIKE VERY 1970s. >> Reporter: REBECCA SMITH IS THE SALES AND MARKET COORDINATOR. AND SHE SAYS THAT TARIFF STRESS IS SHARED BY EVERYONE IN HER BORDER TOWN. >> I THINK PEOPLE ARE SCARED AND I THINK THEY'RE KIND OF FREAKED OUT. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND THEY'RE TRYING TO PLAN FOR THINGS. I KNOW THAT MY MOM WORKS IN AUTOMOTIVE AND MY SISTER WORKS FOR A TOOL AND DIE SHOP THAT PRIMARILY SERVES AUTOMOTIVE AND MY DAD WORKS IN STEEL. SO EVERYBODY I KNOW IS DIRECTLY IMPACTED AND EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT. LIKE IF TRUMP GOES THROUGH WITH WHAT HE'S SUGGESTING, YOU KNOW, I COULD BE THE ONLY ONE IN MY HOUSEHOLD WITH A PAYCHEQUE COMING IN. >> Reporter: REBECCA TELLS ME THAT UNCERTAINTY CHANGED THE MEANING OF THIS ELECTION. >> WE WERE VOTING A CERTAIN WAY A MONTH AGO. AND THEN THIS -- THESE TRUMP TARIFFS AND THE THREAT OF ANNEXATION COMPLETELY PIVOTED I THINK EVERYBODY'S PRIORITIES. KIND OF UNITED THE COUNTRY IN A WAY, WHICH IS GREAT. AND HOW WE'RE VOTING HAS NOW CHANGED. >> Reporter: WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION FOR YOU? >> THE CANADIAN DREAM IS WHAT IS AT STAKE NOW. >> Reporter: WHAT DO YOU MEAN? >> JUST YOUR ABILITY TO LIVE A HAPPY LIFE AND TO, LIKE, TO BUILD A FAMILY, BUILD YOUR LIFE, OWN A HOME. >> Reporter: WITH THE STAKES THAT HIGH IT'S NO WONDER THAT SOME PEOPLE SAY THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION IN A GENERATION. MY NEXT STOP IS THE TOWN OF VERNON IN BRITISH COLUMBIA'S OKANAGAN VALLEY. MORE THAN A QUARTER OF THE POPULATION HERE IS OVER THE AGE OF 65 AND CAROL FAUSETT IS ONE OF THEM. >> I AM SICK OF HEARING STORIES OF SENIORS WHO DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO LIVE ON. I DON'T. IT'S JUST ANNOYING. I'M NOT STARVING, OKAY, I MEAN, I'M NOT. BUT I CAN'T GO OUT AND BUY MEAT. WHO CAN AFFORD THAT ONE? I JUST THINK ALL OF THIS NONSENSE WITH TRUMP HAS REALLY INFLUENCED AND IMPACTED OUR ELECTIONS HORRIFICALLY. >> Reporter: CAROL WORKED FOR DECADES IN NON-PROFITS. NOW THAT SHE'S RETIRED SHE'S PART OF A GROUP CALLED SENIORS TIN CUP. THEY RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT SENIORS' ISSUES. >> IT DOESN'T HELP WHEN YOUR OWN GOVERNMENT DOESN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT SENIORS. SO AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED THEY'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT, THEY'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT US AND WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. >> Reporter: YOU KNOW, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS AT STAKE FOR SENIORS IN THIS ELECTION? >> THE MAIN THING THAT IS AT STAKE I THINK IS THE FINANCES OF THE SENIORS AND HOW I HAVE TO LIVE. WE NEED TO TAKE A LONG HARD, SERIOUS LOOK AT THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR SENIORS, BECAUSE IT'S CRAPPY. >> Reporter:BUT CAROL SAYS THAT THE CHALLENGE FACING SENIORS GOES DEEPER THAN MONEY. >> I'M THE INVISIBLE IGNORED SENIOR. WE ARE NOT LISTENED TO. WE ARE NOT HEARD. WE ARE NOT SEEN. I'M 77 AND I HAVE A WHOLE QUACK OF LIFE UNDER MY BELT. WE ARE TIRED OF NOT HAVING ENOUGH. >> Adrienne: COMING UP, WITH JUST FIVE DAYS UNTIL THE ELECTION, OUR POLL ANALYSTS ARE HERE TO BREAK DOWN THE LATEST NUMBERS. >> I THINK WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE LIBERAL LEAD OVER THE CONSERVATIVES HAS SHRUNK. >> Adrienne: MORE ON WHAT THE POLLS ARE SHOWING AND WHAT TO WATCH FOR NEXT. (♪♪) (♪♪) >> Adrienne: OUR POLLING ANALYSTS ARE HERE TO TELL US WHAT THE LATEST NUMBERS REVEAL. ACCORDING TO THE CBC NEWS POLL TRACKER, THE LIBERALS ARE AT 42.7%, AND THE CONSERVATIVES 38.3%. SO HERE'S HOW THAT WOULD TRANSLATE INTO POTENTIAL SEATS. IF THE ELECTION WERE HELD TODAY, THE LIBERALS WOULD BE POISED TO ELECT 192 M.P.s AND THE CONSERVATIVES, 122. IT TAKES 172 SEATS TO WIN A MAJORITY. WE HAVE TO STRESS OF COURSE THAT THESE ARE JUST AN AGGREGATE OF HOW THE POLLS LOOK TODAY. ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN ON ELECTION DAY. (♪♪) >> ÉRIC GRENIER IS BEHIND THE CBC NEWS POLL TRACKER AND THE WRIT, AND PHILIPPE FOURNIER IS THE EDITOR AND CHIEF OF 338. SE, GENTLEMEN, REALLY GOOD TO SEE YOU. AND IT'S NOT OVER, BUT TICK-TICK IT'S GETTING DOWN TO THE WIRE. WHAT YOU HEAR IN THE ATMOSPHERE IS THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT OH, THE POLLS ARE TIGHTENING. BUT ARE THEY REALLY? AND IF SO, WHAT DOES IT MEAN? >> THEY ARE TIGHTENING A BIT. AND WHEN WE HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF MOVEMENT IN THE POLLS PEOPLE ARE DESPERATE TO SEE SOMETHING CHANGING FROM DAY-TO-DAY. I THINK THAT WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE LIBERAL LEAD OVER THE CONSERVATIVES HAS SHRUNK AND IT'S NOW SOMEWHERE AROUND FOUR OR FIVE POINTS, INSTEAD OF SIX OR SEVEN WHERE IT WAS A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH OF A CHANGE IN ONTARIO AND THE LIBERALS STILL AHEAD IN QUEÉBEC, AND ATLANTIC CANADA, SO ALL OF THE INGREDIENTS FOR THEM TO WIN THE MOST SEATS AND TO STILL PROBABLY A MAJORITY IS STILL THERE. EVEN IF WE SEE THAT MARGIN BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES NATIONALLY HAS GOTTEN A LITTLE BIT SMALLER THAN IT WAS A WEEK OR TWO AGO. >> Adrienne: SO, PHILIPPE, WHAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU FOUND INTERESTING ABOUT THE POLLS OVER THE LAST FOUR WEEKS? >> WELL, THE CAMPAIGNS THAT END THE WAY THEY BEGAN IN THE POLLS ARE ACTUALLY THE EXCEPTION. IT'S VERY RARE. AND NOW WE SEE, OF COURSE, THE BIG MOVEMENT THAT HAPPENED IN PUBLIC OPINION WAS BEFORE THE WRIT DROPPED. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE CURB SINCE LATE MARCH, THE NUMBERS HAVEN'T REALLY MOVED AS ERIC SAID. AND YOU TALK ABOUT TIGHTENING -- YES, THE OVERALL NUMBERS TIGHTENED BY A POINT OR TWO, BUT IT DID NOT TIGHTEN WHERE THE CONSERVATIVES NEEDED. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SEAT PROJECTIONS ON MY WEBSITE AND THE CBC TRACKER WE SEE THAT THE LINES HAVE BEEN FLAT SINCE LATE MARCH, EARLY APRIL. >> Adrienne: INTERESTING. COULD WE TALK ABOUT SOME SPECIFICS HERE BECAUSE IN A CANADIAN ELECTION THERE'S THE BIG PICTURE, BUT THEN THERE ARE 343 LOCAL RACES. SO I'M CURIOUS, ERIC, WHAT IS ONE RIDING THAT YOU WILL BE PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO ON MONDAY NIGHT? >> WELL, IT'S LIKE TRYING TO CHOOSE YOUR FAVOURITE CHILD, I SUPPOSE. BUT ONE OF THE RIDING THAT I'M INTERESTED IN IS PORT MOODY-COQUITLAM IN THE B.C. LOWER MAINLAND. THIS IS A RIDING THAT HAS BEEN A CLOSE THREE-WAY RACE FOR ACTUALLY THE LAST THREE ELECTIONS AND THE N.D.P. HAVE WON IT TWICE AND THE CONSERVATIVES WON IT OVER THAT TIME BUT THE LIBERALS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN THAT FIGHT. WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF MOVEMENT IN BRITISH COLUMBIA, AND THE LIBERALS UP AND THE N.D.P. WAY DOWN. SO THIS RIDE WILL BE A TEST CASE WILL THE LIBERALS MAKE THE GAINS THEY NEED TO GET UP INTO MAJORITY TERRITORY? WILL THE CONSERVATIVES MAKE GAINS THEY NEED IN SUBURBAN AREAS OF THE COUNTRY TO HAVE A SHOT AT WINNING THE ELECTION? AND WILL THE N.D.P. SURVIVE THIS ELECTION AT ALL? I THINK THAT PORT MOODY-COQUITLAM IS ONE OF THE RIDINGS THAT I'LL BE WATCHING ON ELECTION NIGHT. >> Adrienne: OKAY, THAT'S ONE FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA. PHILIPPE, WHAT WILL YOU WATCH IN PARTICULAR? >> TROIS-RIVIÉRES BETWEEN QUÉBEC CITY AND MONTRÉAL IS AN INTERESTING CASE. TROIS-RIVIÉRES HAS SWUNG IN THE PAST. IT'S WON TO THE P.C.s AND THE WON BY THE BLOC QUEÉBECOIS AND THE N.D.P. TOOK IT IN THE ORANGE WAVE AND THE BLOC QUÉBÉCOIS WON IT BACK, BUT THE FEDERAL LIBERALS HAVE NOT WON THE RIDING OF TROIS-RIVIÉRES SINCE 1980. RIGHT NOW WITH THE NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE IT SHOWS THAT THE LIBERALS ARE COMPETITIVE IN TROIS-RIVIÉRES AND YOU EVEN SAW MR. CARNEY CAMPAIGN IN TROIS-RIVIÉRES YESTERDAY. SO PERHAPS THEIR INTERNAL POLLING SHOWS THEY HAVE A SHOT. IF THE LIBERALS WIN TROIS-RIVIÉRES IT COULD SIGNAL A VERY GOOD NIGHT IN QUÉBEC AND, OF COURSE, A GOOD NIGHT NATIONALLY. >> Adrienne: SO AS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN STUDYING 122 RIDINGS IN ONTARIO, I'M KIND OF SURPRISED THAT NEITHER ONE OF YOU SPOKE ABOUT ONTARIO. BUT I AM CURIOUS, ERIC, WHERE IN THAT PROVINCE WILL YOU BE MOST INTERESTED IN? >> WELL, IT'S OBVIOUSLY THE GREATER TORONTO AREA. THIS IS THE REGION OF THE COUNTRY THAT THE LIBERALS HAVE WON IN THE LAST THREE ELECTIONS AND IT HAS DELIVERED THEIR GOVERNMENT. BUT I THINK THAT WHY WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT ONTARIO IS THAT THE LIBERAL LEAD THERE IS PRETTY BIG AND WE'RE NOT SEEING A LOT OF INDICATIONS THAT CONSERVATIVES WILL MAKE THE BREAKTHROUGH THEY NEED. IF DO SEE THAT SOME OF THE G.T.A., PARTICULARLY MISSISSAUGA AND BRAMPTON AND OAKVILLE, IF THEY TURN BLUE ON ELECTION NIGHT THEN MAYBE PIERRE POILIEVRE HAS A CHANCE TO WIN. BUT THE NUMBERS SUGGEST THAT ONTARIO IS TRENDING TOWARDS THE LIBERALS AND IF THAT HOLDS THEY'RE GOING TO WIN THE ELECTION. >> Adrienne: PHILIPPE, ANYTHING THAT WE'RE MISSING THERE? >> WELL, I ALSO LOOK AT ATLANTIC CANADA. LAST TIME THE CONSERVATIVES WON EIGHT SEATS THERE, SO THIS WILL BE THE EARLY RESULTS THAT WE'LL HAVE. IF WE SEE THE CONSERVATIVES ARE NOT ABLE TO HOLD THEIR OWN IN ATLANTIC CANADA IT COULD SIGNAL A BAD NIGHT. >> Adrienne: AS ALWAYS, YOU GUYS GET SO MUCH IN, IN SUCH A LITTLE TIME AND IT'S IMPRESSIVE AND HELPS US ALL. SO THANK YOU BOTH FOR JOINING US AGAIN. AND ENJOY ELECTION NIGHT. >> THANKS VERY MUCH. >> THANK YOU, ADRIENNE. >> Adrienne: CHEERS. >>> UP NEXT, A NOVA SCOTIA MAN PROVES THAT IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO STEP OUTSIDE OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE. ♪ WELL I GUESS THAT I SHOULD FIND SOMETHING ELSE ♪ >> Adrienne: A SPECIAL WAY THAT >> Adrienne: YOU'RE LOOKING AT MAX GALLANT, HE'S A MUSICIAN FROM DARTMOUTH, NOVA SCOTIA, ABOUT TO MARK SOME MAJOR MILESTONES BECAUSE HE'S ABOUT TO TURN 90 YEARS OLD. HE'S ALSO ABOUT TO RELEASE HIS VERY FIRST ALBUM, THANKS WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM HIS FRIENDS. HOW IT ALL COMES TOGETHER MARKS OUR ""MOMENT."" >> MY NAME IS MAX GALLANT. I'M JUST ABOUT READY TO TURN 90. I STARTED PLAYING PROBABLY WHEN I WAS ABOUT 11 OR 12 YEARS OLD. IF IT WASN'T FOR KIRK I WOULD HAVE NEVER EVEN KNOW THAT I COULD SING A LITTLE BIT. BUT HE BROUGHT ALL OF THAT OUT. ♪ AND MAMA TOO ♪ >> MY NAME IS KIRK BERNARD, AND I AM FROM P.E.I. I AM A MUSICIAN. AND I MET MAX THROUGH MUSIC. HE SAID THAT MY HANDS ARE BOTHERING ME, I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN PLAY. AND I SAID, OKAY, CAN YOU SING? AND HE SAID, NO, I CAN'T SING. AND I SAID, WELL, WHY DON'T WE GIVE IT A TRY. >> I SANG A SONG AND HE SAID THAT DON'T SOUND TOO BAD. HE SAID LET'S MAKE A C.D. THERE WAS NO GREEN BANANAS. >> IT WAS A LABOUR OF LOVE. >> I NEVER THOUGHT THAT I'D EVER, EVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS. BETTER LATE THAN NEVER. >> NOT BAD, OL' BOY. >> Adrienne: SO MAY 14TH IS THE BIG DAY FOR THE BIRTHDAY AND THE ALBUM RELEASE PARTY AND THE OLD NO GREEN BANANAS IS A REFERENCE TO AN OLD GEORGE BYRNES VOTE, A COMEDIAN PERFORMING INTO HIS 90s AND ONE OF HIS BITS WAS THAT AT THIS AGE I DON'T EVEN BUY GREEN BANANAS.",2,The video transcript does not strongly support conspiracy theories or mis/disinformation.

THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR TOOK A SWIPE OF THE DEMOCRATS, SAYING ""I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PARTY IS. I AM STILL STRUGGLING WITH THAT."" THAT CRITICISM COMES AS THE PARTY TRIES TO REBRAND THEMSELVES. ""THE NEW YORK TIMES"" CHRONICLING THE RISE OF DEMOCRATS WHO THINK A NEW, PROVOCATIVE, EDGY ATTITUDE WILL HELP THEM TO BEAT TRUMP. AND GOING DARK WOKE IS ALL THE RAGE AMONG DEMOCRATS WHO ARE DESPERATE FOR AUTHENTICITY. >> THIS IS WHAT KICKING THE [BLEEP] OUT OF FASCISM LOOKS LIKE. >> I THINK I CAN KICK MOST OF THEIR [BLEEP]. >> SOMEBODY SLAP ME IN WAKE ME THE [BLEEP] UP. >> ABSOLUTE [BLEEP]. >> ONCE YOU GET SUCCESSFUL, DON'T BE GREEDY AND NOT PAY YOUR TAXES. >> IF YOU COULD SPEAK DIRECTLY TO ELON MUSK WHAT WOULD YOU SAY? >> [BLEEP] OFF. >> SEINFELD CREATOR LARRY DAVID IS TRASHING BILL MAHER BILL MAHER FOR VISITING TRUMP AT THE WHITE HOUSE AFTER WRITING AN OP-ED CALLED ""MY DINNER WITH ADOLF."" AND AL GORE COMPARING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WITH NAZI GERMANY. >> I UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS WRONG TO COMPARE THE THIRD REICH TO ANY OTHER MOVEMENT. IT WAS UNIQUELY EVIL, FULL. BUT THEY WERE IMPORTANT LESSONS FROM THE HISTORY OF THAT EVIL. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS INSISTING ON TRYING TO CREATE THEIR OWN PREFERRED VERSION OF REALITY. >> Jeanine: OKAY, JESSE. ""THE NEW YORK TIMES"" SAYS THAT ""DARK WOKE"" IS THE WAY FOR THE DEMS TO GET THEIR GROOVE BACK. WHAT DO YOU SAY? >> Jesse: THEY SAID THAT ABOUT DARK BRANDON. HE DID NOT GET HIS GROOVE BACK. I TRIED TO AVOID THESE PEOPLE, JUDGE. HE TOLD ME HOW THINGS USED TO GO WITH NANCY PELOSI. WHEN SHE RAN THE THING, SHE WOULD GET HER CAUCUS TOGETHER, GET OUT A CALENDAR APPEARED OKAY, FRIDAY THE JOBS NUMBERS ARE COMING OUT. ON TUESDAY YOU WILL HAVE THE PENTAGON HEARING. THURSDAY, NATO SUMMIT. NEXT WEEK, WHATEVER. SHE WOULD LINE UP OR BEST SPEAKERS FOR EACH OF THOSE ISSUES AND PUT THEM OUT ON TELEVISION, PUT THEM OUT ON PRESS CONFERENCES, AND EVERYBODY WOULD GET THE SAME MESSAGING WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE THE MESSAGING FOR OFFENSE AND THEN FOR DEFENSE. THEN. >>  A LEGAL STRATEGY. THEN SHE BROKE HER HIP, AND SHE WAS COLLATERAL DAMAGE. NO ONE FEARS HAKEEM. NANCY, IF YOU CROSSED HER, SHE WOULD PROBABLY LAUNCH AN ETHICS INVESTIGATION, BUT HE DOES NOT HAVE ANY CLOUT, SO NOW EVERYBODY GOES WHERE THEY WANT AT THE SAME TIME, AND IT'S CHAOS. HE'S AFRAID OF THE BASE. THE BASE IS NOT AFRAID OF THEM. THAT IS WHY YOU ARE SEEING PEOPLE BE RAMBUNCTIOUS TO GET ATTENTION, AND THEY ARE ALL THE ONES GOING TO EL SALVADOR. THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW. UNTIL THEY HAVE SOMEONE WHO CAN RUN THE SHIP LIKE A CAPTAIN, YOU ARE GOING TO SEE MORE OF THIS TRASH. >> Jeanine: IS THE FACT THAT ""THE NEW YORK TIMES"" IS SAYING WE NEED SOMEONE CRASS BUT DISCERNING, RUDE BUT ONLY TO A POINT, THEY ARE DEFINING JASMINE CROCKETT. >> Dana: NOBODY DOES THEIR MARKETING BETTER THAN DEMOCRATS. HOW MANY TIMES DO THEY GO TO THE WELL, PAY CONSULTANTS A GAZILLION DOLLARS TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT IS SO DUMB, THEN ""THE NEW YORK TIMES"" WILL WRITE ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY LOVE THESE PROCESS STORIES. HOW IS ""DARK WOKE"" ANY DIFFERENT FROM BEFORE? IT'S A LITTLE MORE RUDE AND CRASS BUT STILL THE SAME RESULT. THEY ALWAYS DO ALL THE EASY STUFF THAT THEY THINK IS GOING TO GET THEM WHERE THEY THINK THEY NEED TO BE MOSTLY BECAUSE THE MEDIA HELPED THEM FOR A LONG TIME, BUT THE SHIP HAS SAILED. MAYBE IT IS GAVIN NEWSOM WHO FIGURES THAT OUT AND SAYS I KNOW HOW TO BREAK OUT, BE SOMEBODY WHO IS OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON. LET ME BE THE ONE THAT COMES UP AND SOLVES EVERYTHING, TRIES TO COBBLE THIS BACK TOGETHER. I KNOW THAT AT SOME POINT THE DEMOCRATS WILL GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER. I JUST FIND IT REALLY HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE RIGHT NOW. I CANNOT IMAGINE. >> Jeanine: GAVIN NEWSOM IS SINGING I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS. >> Sandra: TAKING A PAGE OUT OF THE DONALD TRUMP PLAYBOOK, FOR SURE. EVEN ""THE NEW YORK TIMES"" PIECE REFERENCES THIS NEW FORM OF COMBATIVE RHETORIC. THEY SAY THEY WANT TO WIN MY BACK THE VOTERS WHO RESPONDED TO THE NO HOLDS BARRED VERSION OF POLITICS, SO THEY WANT TO GO AFTER ""DARK WOKE."" THEY SAY THEY HAVE BEEN LOCKED IN A RESPECTABILITY PRISON. THEY WANT TO GRAB VOTERS ATTENTION. THE ONLY THING YOU CAN TAKE AWAY AS THEY ARE NOT TAKING A PAGE OUT OF TRUMP'S PLAYBOOK. WE ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS WITH POLICY PITCHES, AND THEY ARE STILL FOCUSED ON THE MESSAGING. >> Jeanine: WHAT IS THAT MESSAGING, GREG? >> Greg: THEY HAVE NO MESSAGING. YOU'VE GOT AL GORE AND LARRY DAVID COMPARING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO HITLER. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ARRESTED FOR THAT, SO THAT DOES NOT HELP THEIR ARGUMENT HERE IN THEY DON'T CARE.

A correspondent there, Olarian, says buildings have been shaken today. She had to run from her apartment in fact and I spoke to her a short time ago about what she experienced. I've been living here for 6 years and I have felt uh previous earthquakes inside my building and it has tended to sway a little for a few seconds and then settle. Now what I heard and felt this morning was uh very very different. The building really started to shake uh quite violently and I could hear a sort of a rumble and I must say standing there I was waiting to to see the walls cracking around me but uh fortunately that didn't happen. I left the building quickly along with all my neighbors. uh here in my district which is in the uh European side of Istanbul, people were running out of buildings uh gathering in the streets being careful Christian to stand away from the buildings themselves and there was a degree of shock that was very visible. I saw one woman who is in tears. People were calling relatives, getting calls from relatives, checking to see if they were okay. And the the big quake that you mentioned uh 6.2 was the main one, but there were two smaller ones recorded before that. And in fact, just in the last few minutes, I was briefly back inside my building to collect some equipment. Uh and as I I stood inside the doorway, I could feel another aftershock. Now it was much less uh than what we had felt previously. But it appears that the city has been fortunate if I can put it that way because these quakes and aftershocks were in the sea of Marmra which is off the coast of Istanbul to the west. So, it wasn't actually uh inside the city and and that appears to be why we do not have any reports at the moment of injuries or deaths uh or of buildings collapsing. And and if that had happened, we would certainly know by now because the system here is quite quick and efficient and the emergency disaster agency would put out notifications very fast. So, it appears as if the city has had an escape uh this time. But of course it renews the fears that people here live with that the big one could be coming at any stage and there will certainly be more fear here now of that happening. All going there for us in Istanbul. Two or three quakes that were felt but the interior minister saying in the last hour that there have been more than 50 recorded uh through the course of the day. So uh certainly uh that will put nerves on edge uh in Turkeykey's biggest city.

Some of the wellpreserved skeletons have been found lying in unusual positions and unexpected artifacts are also causing confusion. As our science editor Rebecca Moral reports, from beneath the ground, a medieval mystery is slowly emerging. Located just outside of Cardiff, a cemetery dating to the sixth or seventh century is being excavated. Dozens of skeletons have been found. But what archaeologists have unearthed has left them scratching their heads. Almost every skeleton unusually appears to be a woman, suggesting this isn't an ordinary medieval community. But that's not all. There are about 40 bodies buried in this half of the cemetery that's being excavated. and each of their graves is dug out of a solid layer of limestone bedrock. Now, most of the skeletons that have been found belong to adults, but there are several children here, and their burials are raising questions about this extraordinary cemetery. Infant and child mortality was massively high during this period, and there are only two two children here. The earth that's been used to back fill the grave looks slightly different to that with some of the adults. It's darker. Seems more organic. Potentially some time had elapsed between the burial of the adults and the burial of these two children. More mysteries. More mysteries. Yes. Yeah. Archaeology often does ask more questions, raise more questions than it answers. The people here led hard lives. Their bones show signs of wear and tear. But there were also signs of wealth and luxury amidst the graves. This wasn't just a place where the dead were buried. People also came here to feast and drink with delicate pottery. and finely decorated glass. Glass is is rare and where it is found these are sites of of quite significant status. The glass was probably made in the Levant um probably sort of Egypt area and then was manufactured into vessels we think in in southern France and probably arrived here alongside wine in barrels. Each person here seems to have been buried with great respect and care, apart from one found in a ditch at the edge of the site, tossed in without any ceremony. The bones have been brought to the lab at Cardiff University. This person is an adult. All of their bones are fused. All of their teeth are erupted. And we're pretty sure that this person was female. And what sort of age would she have been, do you think? Maybe late 30s, early 40s. The team don't know why she was treated so differently. Perhaps she was an outcast or even a criminal, but they're trying to find out as much as they can. And the skeleton's teeth can provide vital clues. This single tooth contains a whole life history from about the age of two right through to death, revealing everything from signs of poor health to what people ate at different times of their life and even where they came from. They've been eating a very consistent diet based on lots of carbs, not a lot of meat. And that's true from their childhood into their adulthood. And that's something we're seeing across the population. And any fish? No fish whatsoever. As soon as the Romans leave, we see an absence of fish signals in the diet. It's one of the big mysteries. So, who were these people? Tests on 10 of the skeletons show they came from different parts of Wales and possibly the southwest of England, too, but there's still much more to find out. We're hoping to tell the story of the sort of individuals within the cemetery, but also the kind of broader community. Um, we know a lot about the lives of kings and queens, but but much less about kind of everyday people. And never before really have we been able to explore a single community in so much detail. Only half of this cemetery has been uncovered so far. More will be excavated over the summer. But looking at what's been found already, archaeologists say they're expecting more surprises from this remarkable place. Rebecca Moral, BBC News, Cardiff.",1,"The video transcript does not contain any claims that lack credible evidence or promote unfounded theories. It presents a factual report on a medieval cemetery excavation, sharing archaeological findings and interpretations without suggesting secrecy, cover-ups, or manipulation by powerful entities. The language used is objective and focuses on the scientific process and historical inquiry. There are no patterns of fear-mongering, distrust of authoritative sources, or appeals to emotion over logic. The report is consistent with standard archaeological exploration and historical analysis."

Tariff negotiations are going very well. We're dealing with many, many countries. They all want to be involved with America. Be careful, folks. Mr. President, they all want to be involved with America. And uh we have a lot of action going on. We have we're making a lot of money. this country, this country is not going to be losing money on trade anymore. We were losing $2 trillion a year on trade. Now we're going to be making money, a lot of money. So that's very good. Every country wants to partake. Uh even countries that have ripped us off for many, many years. China is an example. But it's not just China. European Union, they ripped us off for many, many years. And those days are over. We're going to make a lot of money for our people. We'll be able to lower taxes substantially and we're going to be proud of ourselves. We're not going to be a laughingstock that got taken advantage of by virtually every country in the world. Mr. President, Mr. President, we said we thought you said you were going up to a flag. What was going on? We're putting up a beautiful almost 100 foot tall American flag on this side and another one on the other side. Two flags, top of the line. and they've needed flag polls for 200 years. It was uh something I've I've often said, you know, they don't have a flag pole, per se. So, we're putting one right where you saw us, and we're putting another one on the other side on top of the mounds. It's going to be two beautiful poles on China, sir. On China, paid for by Trump. Mr. President, Mr. President, how quickly are the flags when they arrive in about a week or so? And Mr. President China. Can you can you clarify, Mr. President, on China? Are you thinking about Are you thinking about lowering the tariffs? Fair deal with China. It's going to be fair. Are you talking to them actively now? Actively. Everything's active. Everybody wants to be a part of what we're doing. Uh they know that they can't get away with it any longer, but they're still going to do fine. And we're going to have a country that you can be proud of, not a laughingstock, all over the world for many years. You know, in uh 1913, they traded to the income tax system. We used to be all tariff and we had no income tax and we had the wealthiest country we ever had proportionately from about 1870 to 1913. It was all tariffs and we did we had more money than anybody. They had committees how to spend the money. They had so much money they didn't know how to spend. Then some brilliant person said, ""Let's go income tax. Let's let the people pay. We're going to be able to substantially lower taxes when this is finished. So, Mr. Mr. President, how does it look in the meantime? Are you are you considering lowering the tariffs on China while you're negotiating? Looks good. We were losing uh anywhere from three to five billion dollars a day. Think of it. We're losing billions of dollars a day under Biden and and other presidents, frankly. But under Biden, it got really worse. China got out of control. We're losing a trillion dollars a year. trillion, not a billion, not a million, a trillion. And now we're going to be uh making money with everyone and everyone's going to be happy, but we're going to be we're no longer going to be the country that's ripped off by every country in the world. Thank you, Mr. President. About the Pope, sir, about where things stand there.",3,"The transcript features President Trump discussing tariff negotiations and making claims about financial losses and gains, some of which lack detailed evidence or context. While there are no explicit conspiracy theories mentioned, the language suggests a narrative of past exploitation by other countries and a return to financial prosperity under his leadership. The rhetoric could appeal to emotions rather than logic, particularly in statements about being a 'laughingstock' or 'ripped off.' However, there are no overt themes commonly associated with conspiracy theories, placing the assessment at a neutral level."

For more information on Sheath, click the link below in the description or wait until the end of this video. One thing that you should never grow tired of, even though it is wearing is the excuses made from Donald Trump and his administration relative to their bad behavior, even when they are jeopardizing national security. even when they are leaking top secret, highly classified military details to their wifey and dopey brother via Signal on their personal phone. And that's what's taking place right now in Signalgate 2.0, O while they blame everybody else but themselves when they point the finger at journalists from the first time around using weird passive language as though they just happened upon a package at their bus stop with a bunch of military secrets in it. Pete Hegsth is not long for this world relative to the position of a defense secretary. It's already being reported that Donald Trump is on the hunt on the search for a new a replacement for Pete and he knows it and he's acting as panicked as you would believe. He went on he went on with Brian Kilme. Look, look, if this is what you do to try to defend yourself is to go on to Fox News, to Fox and Friends, to plead your case and point the finger at everybody else but yourself. you got a problem. I got two clips I'm going to play for you here. The first is Brian Kilme introing the segment talking about Trump defending Pete Hegsth and then we will talk about uh another wild uh projection art in real life on the part of Pete. First though, the introduction and Pete's opening remarks. Well, that was President Trump doubling down on his support for Defense Secretary Pete Hegath 24 hours ago, denying a New York Times report about sharing sensitive information on another signal chat called Team Huddle. Here to set the record straight himself, uh the former Secretary the current Secretary of State Pete Texet, former host right here on Fox and Friends. What was that, Brian? Who what was that, buddy? you you former former SEC I mean oh well no that's not what I mean I know Freudian slip oh my god I'm so sorry peep I mean former Fox News host which in and of itself is a problem statement anyway that our current secretary of defense of the United States military is the former B team Fox News weekend host all right uh here we go with the clip former secretary the current secretary of state Pete Hex former our host right here on Fox and Friends. Pete, great to see you, Mr. Secretary. Great to see you. So, your thoughts on what's been reporting of team huddle and the signal chat uh that that the New York Times says took place between you, your wife, and your brother and some others. So, Brian, if you remember when this all started, the first goound, because this is the second goound, right? They pedal old stuff, they kick it back up. I said repeatedly, ""No one's texting war plans."" You know why I said that? Cuz I'm in the bowels of the Pentagon every single day. Just 10 minutes ago, I was looking at actual war plans of things that were ongoing or pending things to happen because that's on a regular basis on classified systems. That's my job for the war fighters for the president of the United States. I look at war plans every single day. What was shared over signal then and now, however you characterize it, was informal, unclassified coordinations for media coordination and other things. That's what I've said from the beginning. At the beginning, it was left-wing reporters from the Atlantic who got a hold of it and then wanted wanted to create a problem for the president. Notice there's no denial there. All that is is attacking the messenger. All that is is attacking the reporting and not a an absolute definitive denial that he shared this information with his wife and dopey brother. None. In fact, what you do hear there is a weird passive statement when he says, ""In the beginning, it was left-wing reporters from the Atlantic who got a hold of it."" How how did they get a hold of it, Pete, Leaky Pete? How' they get a hold of it? Is it because you messaged them uh a person in the thread? I is that is that how they got a hold of it, Pete? You are tragically bad at this, brother. So, the interview goes on. The whole thing, the whole ordeal is about 13 minutes. Here's another little bit more than a minute of of Pete Hegsth and uh BDI Brian Kilme going at it here, trying to create some space, some distance between him and the absolute crisis of confidence that the uh the world has in him at his own hand. Watch this. So, Mr. Secretary, I guess uh I can conclude this. We know some bizarre situation with Michael Waltz happened with the first time uh the whole thing with the Signal app came out. You believe this came out. They said it was called Team Huddle because some one of the people who work for you, one of the three who no longer are there, uh, leaked this out as a way to get back at you. That's right, Brian. When you dismiss people who you believe are leaking classified information and again, the investigation is ongoing and that will take time and if when the evidence produced, it will go to DOJ. Why would it surprise anybody, Brian, if those very same people keep leaking to the very same reporters whatever information they think they can have to try to sabotage the agenda of the president or the secretary. So once a leaker, always a leaker, often a leaker. And so we look for leakers because we take it very seriously and we will do the investigation and if those people are exonerated, fantastic. We don't think based on what we understand that it's going to be a good day for a number of those individuals because of what was found in the investigation. So, if they want to keep leaking and pushing and pedalling things that try to sabotage the president's agenda, that's unfortunate. But that's how leaking works in this town. We're focused on recruiting, on rooting out DEI. You're the leaker, Pete. You're the leaker. You're not trying to clean up leaks. It's not because of these leakers that you're in trouble. You're the leaker. You're the leaker. You are the leaker. You provided this information to your wife. No security clearance. No need to know. Even if she did and to your dopey brother who may he may have a security clearance. We don't know. But even if he does, he does not have a need to know. This is the highest level of information that should be very very carefully controlled because of the fact that it puts our war fighters, the ones you act like you're so there for, it puts their lives in risk. And when you're messaging this information on your personal phone, a phone that is no doubt compromised, that has been hacked by the Russians, by the Chinese, by the Israelis, who knows that information could then be sent to enemy forces to thwart the attack and endanger the lives of our warriors. All of this is cosplay for these people. All of this is just a a a patriotism parade. It's just acting as though they are responsible, acting as though it it's just like Donald Trump when he gets on stage and rubs up against the the flag. It's all uh uh just an effort to virtue signal to try to signal to the American people that they are patriots. We love the flags. Look, look, I have a constitution. I must love the Constitution. Cowards, weaklings. If they truly cared, he would be satisfied with just being Secretary of Defense and not having to brag to his wife that he's privy to top secret war plans as he should be as if he's the the the the Secretary of Defense. He shouldn't be cuz he shouldn't be Secretary of Defense. But anyone who holds that position should be secure. Should not have the weakness and insecurity of a child going in.

You know how I'm always saying we should follow the evidence? Well, I've been wearing sheath apparel now for well over two years, and I have to say, the evidence isn't just convincing, it's transformative. Let's face it, I hate buying underwear, and I'm sure you do, too. Everybody hates buying underwear. With sheath, you can stop dreading that purchase because you'll have quality, durable apparel that lasts. Once you experience the sheath difference, you'll wonder how you ever wore anything else. What makes sheath different? That's the question. They're the original creators of pouch underwear technology. Now, I'm not going to get overly detailed here. It makes me a little uncomfortable, but it's essentially providing proper anatomical support that traditional underwear simply doesn't offer. Plus, sheath donates a portion of every single sale to men's mental health initiatives. Something I think many of us can appreciate the importance of. And it makes a noticeable difference whether you're sitting at a desk analyzing political developments for hours or just going about your day. And sheath isn't just for men. They've developed an impressive line for women, too, using the same principles of thoughtful design and premium materials. What I particularly appreciate about Sheath is their commitment to quality. These aren't disposable basics. They're using high performance fabrics that last and their ethical manufacturing practices align with values that many of us in this community share. If you're ready to upgrade your underwear drawer with something that's actually engineered for comfort, head to sheath.com and use code dollar for 20% off your first order. My team and I have switched to sheath.",3,The video transcript presents a critical perspective on Pete Hegseth and the Trump administration

Lisa Caitlyn Collins question to him was, ""Did you ask Albrego Garcia directly whether he was affiliated with this gang?"" She asked him that because you think if you're sitting across from the man, you would ask him. And he had to say, ""No, I did not.""

I'm running a trade deficit. That is the level of understanding of the president of the United States. The trade deficit does not represent at all trade policies. It represents spending relative to production or earnings. We call that an identity. I teach it in the second day of my course in international monetary economics.

Because the congressmen that vote on the budget got into office by being paid for their campaigns by rich people who don't like taxes. So, the political system says, I'm going to show you more clips of Jeffrey Sachs, Professor Sax, in a little bit from that speech that he gave at a recent uh diplomacy forum. But let's just I want to show you a a broad cross-section of views. Um, let me show you next someone by the name of Glenn Hubard, known as a leading conservative economist. Here's what he has to say. Play this clip. Over the last couple of weeks, we've already seen the global economy start to shift away from the United States in in some senses. Um the EU seems to be seeking help from Beijing. Um what damage uh has this last episode done to confidence that people have in American markets? Well, you know, it's a great question. I think of, you know, the Don Rumsfeld known knowns and known unknowns, unknown unknowns. The known known of this period is really the possibility of a short-term recession that we we talked about. I'm actually even more worried about the unknown unknown of a loss of confidence in the nation. We are seeing the reason of for American exceptionalism from an economic supposed political perspective is that we're seen as a safe haven. This is a predictable rule of law country, solid courts and financial markets and institutions. It's a place where you can do business. And so I think trifling with that strikes me as even more problematic. And so I worry about that unknown unknown that people might lose confidence in the dollar or in US debt. Okay. Now let me share with you Ray Dalio. No one will confuse Ray Dalio with a lefty or a leftist. He runs a hedge fund called Bridgewater. He was one of the first to predict that there would be a a great recession in 2008. Um, and you know, he's got a very storied career in this area. He goes, ""What I'm worried about is actually something even worse than a recession happening because of Donald Trump."" Play this clip. I think that um right now we are at a decisionmaking point and very close to a recession. And I'm worried about something worse than a recession. If this isn't handled well, a recession is two negative quarters of GDP and whether it goes slightly there, we always have those things. We have something that's much more profound. We have a breaking down of the monetary order. We are going to change the monetary order because we cannot spend the amounts of money. So we have that problem. And when we talk about the dollar and we talk about tariffs, we have that. We are having a profound changes in our domestic order, how ruling is existing and we're having profound changes in the world order. Such times are very much like the 1930s. I've studied history and this repeats over and over again. So if you take tariffs, if you take debt, if you take the rising power challenging existing power, if you take those factors and look at the PA factors that those changes in the orders, the systems are very very disruptive. How that's handled could produce something that is much worse than a recession. So I wanted to show you that cross-section, but let's go back to Professor Jeffrey Saxs, what he has to say over here. Let's play this clip where he said, ""I would give Donald Trump an F."" Here, play this clip. Donald Trump blames the world. Okay, I fail him for this if he were my student. He's my president. It's a little weirder because when he did this, in two days, the world lost $10 trillion of market capitalization. By the way, where did it go? Uh, did it get transferred from here to here? No, it got destroyed. Why destroyed? Because trade, something also the president of the United States doesn't understand, is mutually beneficial. So if you stop trade, everybody loses. It's not that one side wins, the other side loses. He cannot understand that concept as a guy that traded real estate in New York. So his idea is somebody had to win, somebody had to lose. But what happened when he made this announcement was $10 trillion was wiped out worldwide. It's not that the US went up and they went down. No, everybody went down because the whole world system is based on a division of labor and he's breaking that division of labor into pieces. And then here's Professor Saxs one more time saying that if based on this trade war, he goes, it's not going to be close. Like if you just look up the structure, China will wipe the floor with the United States in a trade war that's being pursued as recklessly as Trump's pursuing it. Here, play this clip. Now, he's going to mess up everything with this, too. Because in a trade war between the US and China, China wins. China does not depend on the US market very much. It's about 12% of China's exports. China will do just fine. It's just dumb policy. That's There's no more, sorry to say it, there's just no more explanation to this than that. It makes no sense. We are in oneperson rule in the United States. Our political system is in a state of collapse. What President Trump did is an emergency decree. Everything he does is an emergency decree. Literally, you can go on to white house.gov and then type follow the menu to executive decrees and there are dozens of them. And each one starts the same way. With the powers invested in in me as president of the United States, I hereby declare a nonsense, b nonsense, c nonsense. Because he's king, those powers are not invested in the president of the United States. They're invested in the Congress. You read article 1, section 8 of our constitution. It says that all duties originate with the Congress. Now, let me share this with you. Democratic Congress member Ro Kana, he said this uh fairly recently as well. And it's important to note that uh Congress member Ro Kana, Democrat, a former very successful business person before going into Congress and he represents the Silicon Valley area. More billionaires in his district than anywhere in the United States. Here's what he has to say. Play this clip. I mean, you know, Lutnik, I I don't like picking on people, but he was on TV on Sunday saying that by having these tariffs, we're going to be doing more screwing and assembling of screws of the iPhone. And today, I I'd love Howard Lutnik to come to my district because look, the screws and the assemblies of screws are like 3% of the iPhone's cost. you you have the display, you have ran memory, you have the camera, and I know Lutnik loves 19th century policies, but he should understand 21st century production. So, he'd be a great start and putting someone there are a lot of people, they're Republicans, but hey, Curtin would be good. I don't know. I'm sure Joe has is it for all these tariffs and so bring someone in who's going to have some common sense. And then finally, let me share this with you. This is from uh CNBC right here. Another economist went on and described how Trump is having us jump into a recession right now. Play this clip. And they've taken that hand and made it worse. So, what do you think it means for the economy now? I think we're jumping into recession. You never just glide in. We're going into it right now. Um I think you'll see housing continue to slow down given the elevated interest rate outlook. So, new home sales probably slow down. uh investment spending is likely going to drop meaningfully. I mean, you're already seeing that across a range of surveys and um I think employment will be the next thing that that that that moderates. Job finding rates have collapsed. Quits rates are collapsing. I mean, this is uh it's not a good situation. So, I you know, I don't like playing this sort of ridiculous game about 50% chance over the next 12 months. I mean, we're we're in it. We're in it. And the only so I thought it was important that I share with you these different perspectives. Again you you can judge for uh yourself but to me the data speaks for itself. I mean again if you look at you know even like what the New York Post is talking about this is from Charles Gaspirino. I mean of the New York Post, right? He owned by Murdoch Scoop. About 10 days ago, Scott Bessant began telling Wall Street executives he was making progress cutting trade deals with India, Japan, South Korea, and Australia, some of our biggest trade partners. Then nothing happened and the markets tanked. And by the way, I think this comment by this guy, James Murphrey, makes sense, too. With a 3-day weekend, because the markets were closed on Friday, the administration missed a golden opportunity to announce a trade deal. The deal didn't have to be with a big country. It just had to be a deal. With no deal announced, the market sold off as the probability of prolonged tariffs weighed heavily on the markets and uh economy. You see right there.

Fuse is a startup on an incredibly tricky mission to commercialize nuclear fusion, and we've been granted exclusive access. Right here is uh our assembly area. Fusion is a process that occurs naturally inside the sun and it's what powers it. When two atomic nuclei combine, they release energy. Here on Earth, scientists have been trying to recreate that for almost a century. But now, in the midst of trade wars and with our environment hanging in the balance, the race is on. Unlocking fusion power is going to be technology that you know will propel humanity and unlock civilization prosperity for for centuries. The promise virtually limitless and more or less clean energy. For the nation that cracks it, energy independence and a windfall of riches. When you think about SpaceX, they lowered the dollar per kilogram to orbit and increasing the re reusability of rocket. So they can launch much more frequently and by doing that they've unlocked essentially space and made that way more accessible. But for the nuclear industry this has not happened. So what we're focused on is how do we decrease the cost per radiation and how do we make radiation much more available. They've built Titan, a pulsed power driver capable of producing lightning in a bottle, the equivalent of 800 strikes at once. Inside there are 476 capacitors and 238 custommade switches. Fahed was once one of Iran's top nuclear physicists and is now technical lead here. Assembling 40,000 part is not easy. You miss one part, you're going to lose the project. You're going to fail the project. H Titan is the most challengeable project I've ever had. I love it. And this is Titan. Wow. Check that out. Yeah, it's a one terowatt. The key innovation here is how do you trigger 238 of those bricks within less than 2 ncond uh delay or jitter between them and that's kind of our core technology is being able to build that triggering system. What's holding you back? Well, everything is a challenge, right? So, first we built the machine there's no playbook. We're the first to have built it. May I ask what age are you? Yeah, I'm 24. I turned 25 next month. How have you done this? Yeah, so I'm still figuring it out how how to do it. You know, essentially growing up, my father was a nuclear physicist. That kind of spurred my passion for understanding how the universe works and I really wanted to go see it for myself. you know, how can I use my time in the most uh effective way? And I thought that pursuing fusion as as a startup is the fastest and more intellectually honest way to make progress. Whilst JC may not have decades of experience under his belt, he's convinced some serious industry heavyweights. I spent 30 years at Los Alamos National Laboratory where I had the privilege of working on national security programs. So, what attracted you to Fuse? clean, abundant energy production not only supports our economy, but it also supports national security, defense capabilities, and the like. This is our machine shop, so we're able to rapidly prototype or build components. 75% of the cost of Titan is in three components and now we built two of them in-house for a fraction of the cost and in a couple days of lead time instead of months and in some case almost a year. So here's the Titan control room. Live feedback on voltage, charge voltage, the checklist, the the air delivery system pressure, all of them are software controlled. Despite efforts here, the roll out of nuclear fusion as a practical solution could still be decades away, according to experts who site significant scientific and engineering challenges needing to be overcome. But that isn't deterren. Are you making history here? We have already made it. So we we we keep doing that. And they need to fast. Billions of dollars are being poured into cracking fusion globally. And competition is close by. Sam Almanbacked Helion just secured 400 million odd for its efforts. In its latest funding round, several countries around the world are also gearing up. China's reactor, dubbed the artificial sun, is making massive strides. And in the UK, the Atomic Energy Authority aims to open the world's first fusion power plant by 2040. Energy security is national security and we're very conscious to to go all the way to ensure that you know this technology stays in the hand the right hands. Today they're firing their latest model. So we'll start ramping up the voltage and testing out how will the machine you know perform. We'll see what happens. They're going through the final checklist preparations before they fire up Titan. My hands are getting sweaty. Don't know why I'm getting nervous. 3 2 1 break. Will we solve it or not? To be determined. Are we going to make a large contribution in solving uh this large monumental problem? Yes, we're already doing so.

I order that all military actions be stopped for this period. We assume that the Ukrainian side will follow our example. At the same time, our troops must be ready to repel possible violations of the truths and provocations from the enemy. But the only provocations have come from Russia. Farms in Ukraine's Adessa region, the latest victims of Moscow's three-year war. So why announce a ceasefire now? Answer: American patience is wearing thin. If for some reason uh one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we're just going to say you're foolish, you're fools, you're horrible people, and we're going to just take a pass. But hopefully uh we won't have to do that. Vladimir Putin's trying to cast himself as the peacemaker here to keep the White House on side so that relations with Washington continue to thaw. But what he's proposed is nothing like what Donald Trump first asked for or what Ukraine agreed to, which was a ceasefire for 30 days. This is for 30 hours. And there's skepticism it'll have any real impact on the battlefield. If there's going to be a genuine effort by the Trump administration to end this war, it's going to take a focused diplomatic approach, concentration, and patience. Those aren't notable traits of Mr. Trump. Ukraine was also dismissive with President Zalinski proposing to extend the ceasefire beyond Easter. That is what will reveal Russia's true intentions, he wrote, because 30 hours is enough to make headlines, but not for genuine confidencebuilding measures. 30 days could give peace a chance. Some things have changed here this Easter after a mass prisoner swap. 246 captives released by each side. That feels a lot more meaningful than Moscow's latest maneuver.

But in its conclusion of its inquiry, the Israeli military said it found no evidence of execution. Well, this is the video from the incident. It was obtained from the mobile phone of one of the medics who was killed and it was given to the New York Times newspaper. And that video being made public forced the Israeli army to admit that its initial account claiming that the vehicles approached without lights was in fact untrue. Well, the Israeli army's inquiry says troops did not use indiscriminate fire in the incident. It said a deputy commander will be dismissed from his position. Well, the Palestine Red Cresant Society and others have been calling for an independent international investigation. Well, let's get the latest on that breaking news by going straight to Jerusalem and joining my colleague Gary O' Donahue who is there. Um, Gary, just tell us more about what we know from the Israeli military and this internal investigation. Well, I think we're seeing in this report that the Israeli army has come some distance from its initial uh description of what happened a week after the incident at the end of March. But even given that, it's still saying that this was in a sense an operational misunderstanding in terms of the deaths of the 14 medics and civilian civil defense workers. in terms of the the killing of the UN worker, uh they're saying that was a breach of orders and and they are dismissing, as you said, the battalion, the deputy bot battalion commander from the Galani uh brigade there. So that is that is unusual for the Israeli army to actually dismiss someone, but that is a field commander on the ground. What else? In terms of further up the command chain, it's a reprimand for the brigade commander himself. Uh I think the there are still a lot of unanswered questions. Firstly, of course, you know, people will say, ""Look, these vehicles were approaching rapidly. Uh there were lots of people jumping out of them."" Well, that's kind of what happens with ambulances and fire trucks, right? When they get to an incident and we already know, of course, that from earlier video evidence that these ambulances did have their lights on, did have their emergency signals on. And so this this description of the commander not being able because of night visibility or problems with visibility at night to identify them that raises questions. Uh also I think they are now or continuing to assert that six of those who died six of the 14 ambulance workers and civil defense workers were retrospectively as they put it identified as members of Hamas. Now they have not produced any evidence for that. the names of all those ambulance uh workers and civil defense workers are in the public domain so they could identify which ones they believe to be Hamas and then people could go off and find out whether or not that was true or not. It's worth also pointing out I think that the IDF has already acknowledged that all of those who died were unarmed at this point in time. It does say, of course, and there has been evidence for this in the past, that Hamas has used medical vehicles to transport fighters at times. It we know it's also used hospitals and schools at times to base some of its operations, some of its staff, some of its structures, if you like, its control structures. But I think this will this does really mark a a bit of a low point for the Israeli army uh in terms of this incident because this is this is pro you know one of the bloodiest involving the killing of of medical workers specifically and and rescue workers if you like uh during this whole war. And Gary um I spoke to the Palestine Red Cresant after uh this all happened and they were adamant that they wanted an independent investigation. I'm I'm assuming we don't yet have reaction from them, but um I'm guessing that this is unlikely to satisfy those who were calling for an independent investigation. I think that's certain to be the case. Uh I think it's worth also pointing out, of course, that the the PRCS, the the Red Cresant Society, uh there were some initial assertions from then that these men may have been bound uh before they were killed. Now, uh there doesn't seem to be any evidence of that. The Israeli army is denying that and and the autopsies autopsies that were carried out by Hamas uh health officials, the forensic examiners on the ground subsequent to that have not found any evidence of that. So, that is one thing I think Israel is is stressing and certainly stresses very close to the top of the report. to the parts of the report we have seen. But you're right, of course, they will say, ""Look, these men were unarmed. Uh they were behaving like ambulances because they were ambulances and you've not explained uh how this misidentification could take place."" Uh it's also worth saying I think the report is suggesting that this is a combat zone. Now, Gaza is a combat zone clearly, but there are clear designations at times for specific areas. And from what I can see in this initial look through it, the IDF does not seem to be claiming that this was specifically one of these red zones at the moment where you have to get permission to move around. Now, we'll check that of course, but from what I can see initially, that's not being claimed by the IDF. So if that is true, if I'm right about that, then the ambulances uh and the civil defense uh people, you know, were moving around in that in that sense legitimately or without the kind of restrictions that Israel and the IDF imposes on them. And Gary, we were showing on the screen um a few seconds ago the video of the incident, which of course was pivotal really in terms of uncovering what exactly happened. Yeah, this was a I mean a really distressing video I think you'd have to say. Uh it was found on the phone of a man called Rafat Radwan. He was one of those who died. He was in one of the the second batch of ambulances uh that were sent out to to find some of their colleagues who uh were by the side of the road in a in the first ambulance. Uh, and there's quite a lot of time where you hear him praying, you hear him aware, I think that he's going to die. Um and of course that is the video that emerged what 10 days ago, two weeks ago perhaps no just 10 days ago now which shows us that these ambulances did have their lights on, did have their emergency signals on which of course the IDF had claimed they did not when they gave their first explanation of what had happened. And I think that's really that video really forced the hand of the Israeli Defense Forces to come up with a a much fuller explanation than they sometimes do in these circumstances. And I think that's why you're seeing uh some disciplinary action, a promise uh to learn some lessons uh a an expression of of what they call regret for the harm to for uninvolved civilians. I think some people will think that is a some somewhat of an understatement of what took place. But yeah, I don't think this this is going to go away in any sense at this point in time and the pressure will be will be kept up. Meanwhile, of course, civilians, dozens of civilians each day in Gaza are dying. Uh and the humanitarian situation uh is getting much worse according to the various agencies that work",2,"The video transcript does not explicitly promote conspiracy theories or mis/disinformation. It discusses the results of an Israeli military inquiry into a tragic incident, acknowledging failures and discrepancies in initial reports. While there are mentions of potential cover-ups and calls for independent investigations, these are common in serious incidents and do not necessarily constitute conspiracy theory promotion.

Pakistan's foreign minister has been holding talks with Taliban officials in Kabul. Pakistan has ramped up efforts to forcibly expel thousands of Afghan refugees from the country, including those who were born in Pakistan or have lived there for decades. Over 2 million people are expected to be deported to Afghanistan in the coming weeks and many are concerned this influx could further destabilize the country. BBC Afghans correspondent Yama Baris has been given rare access to those at the border. He sent this report. Returning reluctantly to a homeland they don't know. Thousands of Afghans forced out of Pakistan. Many arriving in Afghanistan as strangers. I was born in Pakistan. I got married there. Lived my entire life there. And now this has happened to me. Look at our condition. We haven't slept in a week. Pakistan has intensified efforts to expel undocumented Afghan refugees, claiming that the country cannot cope with the sheer numbers and that some of the Afghan refugees present a security threat. According to the Taliban officials here in Turkham area, around 700 to 800 Afghan families cross this border on daily basis. And there is little comfort on the other side. Many crossing have no connection to the country. Our children have never seen Afghanistan. And even I don't know what it looks like anymore. It might take us a year or more to settle in and find work. We feel helpless. His children offer some hope. He asks which country is better. She replies, ""The Taliban and aid agencies are offering some shelter, food, and medical care. But with up to 2 million Afghans expected to be expelled in the coming days and weeks, there is a concern that the already struggling country will be overwhelmed. and there is unease about the safety and rights of those forcibly returned. Salai who has three daughters is worried about their future. I want my children to study so their previous school years are not wasted. In Afghanistan, girls over the age of 12 are banned by the Taliban government from receiving an education. They should allow both girls and boys to get an education. They should open schools for the newly returned Afghans and the people who were here before. They have the right to education. For now, they g what they can for the road ahead. Searching for a new life. As the returnees delve deeper into Afghanistan, they must learn to once again call this land home. Yamarez, BBC News.

So, we asked the White House press secretary, ""Which outlet are you with?"" The Canadian Public Broadcaster. Oh, nice to see you. Thank you. Whether Trump has changed his mind ever since the election campaign started, uh, he stopped talking about Canada becoming the 51st state, at least publicly. I'm wondering if that's on purpose and why. I would reject the president's position on Canada has shifted. The president still maintains his position on Canada. The United States has been subsidizing Canada's national defense and uh he believes that Canadians would benefit greatly from becoming the 51st state of the United States of America. Amid annexation concerns, Trump's trade war continues to sew uncertainty for Canadian businesses and in particular the auto sector. While there are some carveouts for KUSMA compliant components, the US has 25% tariffs on foreignade autos with new tariffs on foreignade auto parts set to kick in by May 3rd. Yesterday in the Oval Office, President Trump suggested that there could be some help for automakers. I'm wondering what that looks like. I don't have anything to read out for you there, but I think the point the president was making is flexibility. Um, and he has flexibility when it comes to negotiations and talks. As for Trump's negotiations and talks with America's trading partners and rivals, tensions are mounting. Chinese President Xi Jinping arriving in Malaysia, the second stop on his reassurance tour as he tries to present Beijing as a reliable trading partner. In the face of external uncertainties, China will insist on joining hands rather than throwing punches. This Chinese foreign ministry spokesman says if those tensions are going to ease, the White House is looking to Beijing to make a move. The ball is in China's court. China needs to make a deal with us. We don't have to make a deal with them. China has a challenge in presenting itself as a reliable partner given its history of trading practices drawing intense criticism from the West. But it is still trying to make the case in this moment when US policy is evolving unpredictably. And Katie, we're expecting to learn more this week about additional tariffs. Yeah, the Trump administration is expected to announce details about new tariffs on semiconductors and electronics. After that, it will likely be pharmaceuticals and then possibly critical minerals as well. The White House has taken the first step on the path toward tariffs for that sector. All right, thank you Katie. That's our Katie Simpson in Washington.

I'M ADRIENNE ARSENAULT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. >>> HAVING FOUR FEDERAL PARTY  LEADERS TODAY FOR A RECKONING  OF RHETORIC AND POLICY COULD  SHAPE THE LAST CHAPTER OF THE  RACE AND EVERYONE ON THAT STAGE BEHIND ME KNEW IT. >> HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA --  >> WITH RESPECT TO PROJECT --  >> THE QUESTION WAS WITH  RESPECT TO PIPELINES.  >> I APPRECIATE IT. I'M GETTING TO THAT.  >> I'M SORRY BUT THE LIBERALS  AND N.D.P. ARE NOT GOOD AT  MATH.  >> I'M SORRY TO CRASH YOUR  PARTY, GUYS, BUT YOU'RE TELLING FAIRY TALES. >> Adrienne: SO HOW WAS IT? IT WAS COMBATIVE, SOME OF THE  SUBSTANTIVE. WE HAVE GOT THE DETAILS OF A  DEBATE DISCUSSING A COUNTRY,  THE STAKES, AND ITS  SOVEREIGNTY. AS WE WERE WATCHING, ASHLEY  BURKE WAS DOING THE SAME THING  IN OTTAWA. ASHLEY, IT WAS ALL ABOUT HOW  THE LIBERAL AND CONSERVATIVE  LEADERS PERFORMED BECAUSE SO  MUCH OF THIS RACE WAS FOCUSED  ON THEM. >> Reporter: ADRIENNE, TIME IS  RUNNING OUT FOR MARK CARNEY'S  OPPONENT PIERRE POILIEVRE TO  MAKE A COME BACK.  >> ARE YOU PREPARED TO ELECT  THE SAME LIBERAL STAFFERS, THE  SAME LIBERAL CABINET, THE SAME  LIBERAL MINISTERS THAT WE HAD  FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS. >> 20 SECONDS TO RESPOND TO  THAT.  >> I DO MY OWN TALKING POINTS,  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE BIGGEST RISK WE HAVE TO  THIS AFFORDABILITY, THE BIGGEST RISK WE HAVE TO THIS ECONOMY IS DONALD TRUMP. >> Reporter: A BIG THING FOR  CARNEY TAKE ON IS JUSTIN  TRUDEAU.  >> THEY'RE BOTH GONE, THEY'RE  BOTH GONE [indiscernible] NO,  VERY DIFFERENT. LOOK, I'M A VERY DIFFERENT  PERSON THAN JUSTIN TRUDEAU.  >> WERE YOU HIS ECONOMIC  ADVISOR? >> HOW TO DRIVE RESULTS IN THE  HOUSING MARKET.  >> Adrienne: SO I KNOW YOU  PLAYED CARNEY'S GOOD LINE IN  BUT I KNOW BOTH LEADERS GOT  JABS IN. >> Reporter: HE SURVIVED AND  EMERGED EVEN WHEN N.D.P. LEADER ATTACKED HIM OVER HIS TIME WITH BROOKFIELD INVESTMENT  MANAGEMENT.  >> AS CHAIR, YOUR COMPANY  BOUGHT UP AFFORDABLE HOMES,  KICKED UP THE TENANTS, AND  JACKED UP RENTS. THE QUESTION IS, WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON? >> MY ANSWER IS I'M ON THE SIDE OF CANADIANS. I HAVE A TRACK RECORD OF  SERVICE FOR THIS COUNTRY. >> Reporter: POILIEVRE ALSO  CAME OUT STRONG TO DEFEND HIS  PITCH TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER  TO BECOME THE FIRST PRIME  MINISTER TO OVERRIDE THE  CANADIAN CHARTER OF RIGHTS TO  KEEP MASS MURDERERS IN JAIL  UNTIL THEY DIE.  >> THE CHARTER OF RIGHTS AND  FREEDOMS EXISTS TO PROTECT  CANADIANS FROM PEOPLE LIKE US  ON THE STAGE, POLITICIANS WHO  MAY USE THEIR POWER TO OVERRIDE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS.  >> I'M INTERESTED IN THE RIGHTS OF VICTIMS. MR. CARNEY SEEMS TO BE VERY  INTERESTED IN THE RIGHTS OF  CRIMINALS. HE SAYS THAT IT'S DANGEROUS FOR ME TO ENSURE THAT MASS  MURDERERS STAY BEHIND BARS FOR  LIFE. YOU KNOW WHAT'S DANGEROUS? TURNING THEM LOOSE ON OUR  STREETS. >> Reporter: ADRIENNE, IT'S TOO EARLY TO SAY IF ANYONE'S  PERFORMANCE TONIGHT MADE A  DIFFERENCE. CANADIANS CAN START CASTING  THEIR VOTES TOMORROW WHEN POLLS OPEN. >> Adrienne: ASHLEY, THANK YOU  VERY MUCH. >>> TIME TO BRING IN CBC CHIEF  POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT  ROSEMARY BARTON AND ""POWER &  POLITICS"" HOST DAVID COCHRANE. WE NEED TO GET YOUR TAKEAWAYS  FROM THE EXPERIENCE BUT  SPECIFICALLY TONIGHT. ROSIE? >> Rosemary: THE DYNAMICS OF  THE ELECTION BETWEEN THE  LIBERAL LEADER AND THE  CONSERVATIVE LEADER HAS NOT  CHANGED, AND WE SAW THAT ON THE STAGE, WHETHER THAT BE HOW THEY WERE PLACED OR HOW THEY WERE  CONFRONTED. THE N.D.P., AGAIN, TRYING THEIR BEST TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE  ISSUES THAT MATTERED TO THEM  BUT I DON'T THINK YOU COULD  WATCH THAT DEBATE AND THINK  ANYTHING THAT IT'S ONE OF THESE TWO MEN THAT'S GOING TO BE  PRIME MINISTER, AND I THINK YOU SAW THAT MARK CARNEY TOOK THE  BRUNT OF THE ATTACKS, BRUNT OF  THE QUESTIONS FROM THE OTHER  LEADERS AND I WOULD SAY HE WAS  ABLE TO FAIRLY EASILY DISMISS  THEM. WHETHER THEY WERE GOOD ENOUGH  FOR CANADIANS WAS WHAT ASHLEY  WAS TRYING TO GET THAT THERE. PIERRE POILIEVRE HAD SOME  STRONG MOMENTS DEFENDING HIS  OWN POLICIES, WHETHER IT'S  PIPELINES OR BEING TOUGH ON  CRIME. THESE ARE SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES  THAT CANADIANS NEED TO THINK  ABOUT IN THE COMING DAYS BUT IT WAS A GOOD DEBATE WHERE YOU  WALK AWAY THINKING ABOUT  CONTRAST POINTS. >> Adrienne: YOUR VIEW, TOO? >> EVERYBODY ON THAT STAGE  STANDS TO LOSE IF MARK CARNEY  FAILS. YVES-FRANCOIS BLANCHET NEEDS  SUPPORT FOR THE BLOC, N.D.P.  NEEDS VOTERS TO COME BACK TO  MAINTAIN OFFICIAL PARTY STATUS, AND PIERRE POILIEVRE NEEDS TO  HAVE THINGS CHANGE IN  BATTLEGROUNDS IF HE'S GOING TO  FULFILL HIS LIFELONG DREAM OF  BECOMING PRIME MINISTER. PIERRE POILIEVRE TRYING TO  PAINT CARNEY AS JUST THE  TRUDEAU LEGACY FOR A FOURTH  TERM. CARNEY SAID A COUPLE OF TIMES,  I KNOW YOU WANTED TO RUN  AGAINST JUSTIN TRUDEAU AND THE  CARBON TAX BUT THOSE TWO THINGS ARE NO LONGER HERE. >> Adrienne: CARNEY TOOK TWO  RUNS AT THAT LINE, JUST TO MAKE SURE HE HIT IT HOME. >>> I WANT TO GO TO A BIG  DEVELOPMENT, I WOULD ARGUE,  TONIGHT. THIS IS THE DECISION BY THE  DEBATES COMMISSION TO CANCEL  THE NEWS CONFERENCES, THE  SCRUMS WITH THE LEADERS THAT  HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER. CERTAINLY HAPPENED LAST NIGHT,  AND JUST A REMINDER TO FOLKS,  THE DEBATES COMMISSION IS AN  INDEPENDENT BODY. YOU SEE CBC LOGOS HERE  EVERYWHERE. THAT'S BECAUSE CBC PRODUCED THE DEBATE, TRANSMITTED THE IMAGES, BUT IT'S THE DEBATE COMMISSION  THAT'S IN CHARGE OF WHO'S ON  THAT STAGE AND ASKS THE  QUESTIONS. I WANT TO THROW IT TO THE  COMMISSION.  >> AT THIS TIME, IT'S BEEN  DECIDED THERE WILL BE NO SCRUM  WITH THE LEADERS BECAUSE AT  THIS TIME WE CANNOT GUARANTEE A PROPERTY ENVIRONMENT FOR THE -- [indiscernible].  >> Adrienne: OKAY. SO IF YOU COULDN'T HEAR, I  TOTALLY UNDERSTAND IF YOU  COULDN'T, YOU BASICALLY, MICHEL CORMIER SAID THERE WOULD BE NO  SCRUMS. YOUR THOUGHT HERE? >> Rosemary: YEAH, MR. CORMIER  SAID THEY COULD NOT GUARANTEE  THE SAFETY OF THE MEDIA. THAT'S BECAUSE THEY ALLOWED  RIGHT WING ACTIVISTS TO COME  INTO THAT ROOM AND ACT AS  THOUGH THEY WERE MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA. IT MADE FOR A VERY FRAUGHT  ENVIRONMENT AND LED TO A NUMBER OF CONFLICTS AND THAT'S WHERE  WE ENDED UP TONIGHT DAVID I  DON'T WANT TO LITIGATE  SPECIFICS BUT DEMOCRACY IS NOT  GUARANTEED AND IT HAS TO BE  FOUGHT FOR EVEN DURING THE  LEADERSHIP DEBATES. THE RHETORIC THAT'S GONE ON IS  HATEFUL, DISRUPTIVE, AND TOXIC  AND IT IS DISRUPTING THE NORMS  OF CIVIC VIRTUE IN THIS  COUNTRY. TEMPERATURE WAS UP TONIGHT. IT NEEDS TO COME DOWN. ""DRAGON'S DEN"" ROSIE, WE'RE  GOING TO SEE YOU FOR ANOTHER  DEBATE EDITION OF ""AT ISSUE."" SEE YOU THEN. >>> SO THE CBC FACT CHECK TEAM  WATCHING THE DEBATES TONIGHT. CBC REPORTER JONATHAN GATEHOUSE JOINING US NOW. THERE WAS ONE COMMENT THAT MARK CARNEY MADE ABOUT PIERRE  POILIEVRE ELIMINATING FOREIGN  AID. CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH THAT  COMMENT? IS.  >> Reporter: YEAH, ADRIENNE. IT WAS ABOUT AID TO UKRAINE.  >> MR. CARNEY WANTS TO CUT AID  FOR UKRAINE.  >> BUT I DIDN'T SAY THAT. WE HAVE TO STAND BY THEM. >> Reporter: PIERRE POILIEVRE  HAS CRITICIZED CANADA'S FOREIGN AID, SAYING IT OFTEN GOES TO  DICTATORS, TERRORIST GROUPS,  AND GLOBAL BUREAUCRACY, BUT HE  HAS NEVER SAID HE PLANS TO  ELIMINATE IT, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE LIBERAL LEADER, HE HAS  VOWED TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT  UKRAINE IN ITS WAR AGAINST  RUSSIA. >> Adrienne: AND DID THE  CONSERVATIVE LEADER SAY  ANYTHING THAT CAUGHT YOUR  ATTENTION? IS.  >> Reporter: YEAH, HE SAID  SOMETHING ABOUT TAXES.  >> THE AVERAGE CANADIAN SPENDS  MORE ON TAXES THAN FOOD AND  SHELTER COMBINED.  >> Reporter: THIS STEMS FROM A  SINGLE 2020 STUDY FROM THE  FRASER INSTITUTE. THEY CALCULATED THAT THE  AVERAGE CANADIAN FAMILY PAYS  43% OF THEIR INCOME IN FEDERAL, PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL TAXES  VERSUS 38% FOR FOOD AND  SHELTER. THE PROBLEM IS THEY INCLUDED  C.P.P. AND E.I. PAYMENTS. THE STUDY DIDN'T TAKE CARBON  TAX OR INFLATION INTO ACCOUNT,  AND WHEN YOU DO THAT, THE  AVERAGE TAXES PAID BY CANADIANS IS VIRTUALLY UNCHANGED SINCE  2016. >> Adrienne: AND JONATHAN,  JAGMEET SINGH WAS PRETTY FEISTY TONIGHT. LOTS OF INJECTION --  INTERJECTIONS, LOTS OF  COMMENTS. WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF IT? >> Reporter: THE N.D.P. CLAIM  MARK CARNEY WANTS TO BALANCE  THE FEDERAL BUDGET AND THAT  MEANS IT WILL BE BILLIONS IN  SERVICE CUTS. CARNEY SAID HE WILL PROTECT  TRANSFERS TO INDIVIDUALS AND  PROVINCES AND WHEN IT COMES TO  HEALTH CARE, HE'S PROMISING  SPENDING MORE. POILIEVRE H >> I KNOW YOU WANT TO BE  RUNNING AGAINST JUSTIN TRUDEAU. JUSTIN TRUDEAU ISN'T HERE.  >> ARE YOU DENYING YOU WERE HIS ECONOMIC ADVISOR? >> I DID NOT PROVIDE ANY OF  THAT ADVICE, I DID NOT PROVIDE  ANY OF THAT ADVICE -- I'M  SORRY. >> ARE YOU ACCUSING YOUR  LIBERAL PARTY OF LYING? >> Adrienne: OKAY. SO THAT WAS ONE OF SEVERAL  TIMES TONIGHT WHEN JUSTIN  TRUDEAU'S NAME CAME UP AT THE  FEDERAL LEADERS DEBATE. CONSERVATIVE LEADER PIERRE  POILIEVRE TRYING TO PORTRAY  MARK CARNEY AS NO DIFFERENT  FROM THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER. >>> IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS HERE  AT ""THE NATIONAL,"" WE'VE BEEN  TRAVELLING THROUGH THE COUNTRY. IN EACH PLACE WE WENT TO,  PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT THE NEED TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND AND A DESIRE  TO FOLLOW THESE DEBATES  CAREFULLY, SO WE HAD AN IDEA. WE THOUGHT WE'D HAVE A REUNION  OF SORTS. IN St. JOHN, WE HAVE ANN  McSHANE. IN BRAMPTON, CHRIS VICERS, AND  IN MEDICINE HAT, EMMA WALE. CHRIS, I'M GOING TO START WITH  YOU. YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE  UNDECIDED AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW  WHO YOU WERE GOING TO VOTE. WHAT DO YOU THINK NOW? >> WELL, I THINK I'M SWAYING  LIBERAL. HE NEVER INTERRUPTED AND  EVERYONE ELSE DID, AND I FOUND  THAT ANNOYING. >> Adrienne: OKAY. EMMA, YOU WERE VERY CLEAR THAT  YOU WERE VOTING CONSERVATIVE  BUT ALSO VERY CLEAR THAT YOU  WERE GOODING TO HEAR THE  DEBATE, AND I'M CURIOUS WHY,  WHAT YOU'RE LISTENING FOR, AND  WHAT YOU'RE THINKING TONIGHT.  >> YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU HAVE A  JOB, YOU GET A JOB INTERVIEW  BUT THEN YOU HAVE A  PROBATIONARY PERIOD AFTER THAT. I FEEL LIKE THAT IS WHAT THE  DEBATE IS IS AN ACTUALLY, LIKE, THE JOB INTERVIEW PART. IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING TO  HEAR EVERYTHING AND THE POINTS  THAT PEOPLE MADE. TO ME, EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE  SEEN FROM THE LIBERALS THE LAST TEN YEARS, THEY HAVE FAILED  MASSIVELY IN MY OPINION, AND  EVEN WITH YEARS AND YEARS TO  FIX THEIR MISTAKES ALONG THE  WAY, AND I THOUGHT THE BLOC  QUEBECOIS LEADER, HE HAD VERY  GOOD POINTS IN THERE, AND I  ACTUALLY LIKED EVERYTHING HE  HAD TO KIND OF SAY. HE ACTUALLY REMINDED ME OF  DANIELLE SMITH IN THE SENSE  THAT HE'S STANDING UP FOR  QUEBEC, AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS  REALLY COOL TO HEAR, AND I  THINK MORE LEADERS NEED TO BE  LIKE THAT, AND I FEEL LIKE MARK CARNEY DIDN'T ANSWER OR DIDN'T  INTERRUPT PEOPLE AS MUCH  BECAUSE MAYBE HE DIDN'T HAVE  ALL THE ANSWERS AND IT'S EASIER TO STAY QUIET THAN TO SPEAK UP. >> Adrienne: AND ANNE, YOU'RE  THE ONLY ONE WHO VOTED EARLY  BECAUSE YOU'RE ON VACATION. >> YEA. THE DEBATE KIND OF TESTED MY  KNOWLEDGE AND THEY WENT AT IT  ON A FEW TOPICS THAT I WASN'T  CERTAIN ON, SO I ENJOYED HOW  THEY DUG INTO SOME OF THOSE  TOPICS. THE PIPELINE DEBATE, THE  HOUSING, I ENJOYED THAT,  REALLY. IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY  TO TEST YOURSELF IF YOU'RE IN A BIT OF A GUT CHECK TO SEE IF  YOU'RE ON TRACK, YEAH. >> Adrienne: IT'S A BIT EARLY  FORE BUYER'S REMORSE.  >> YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I WAS  ASKING, AM I GOING TO HAVE  BUYER'S REMORSE BUT NO, I'M  GOOD. >> Adrienne: OKAY. CHRIS, I THINK OF YOU WHEN WE  TALKED BECAUSE YOU'RE AN AUTO  WORKER AND YOU HAVE TONNES OF  CONCERNS. I KNOW YOU SAID YOU HAD YOUR  CONCERNS SOOTHED, BUT WHAT DID  YOU NOT HEAR THAT YOU WANTED TO HEAR? >> I THINK I GOT ALL OF MY  QUESTIONS ANSWERED. MARK CARNEY DIDN'T ANSWER WHAT  I WANTED TO HEAR BUT PIERRE  POILIEVRE WAS GOING ON ABOUT  CHANGE, CHANGE, CHANGE. I HONESTLY THINK PEOPLE WANT  THAT, AND I WANT THAT, TOO, BUT I DON'T THINK HE'S THE RIGHT  PERSON. I THINK CARNEY'S VERY SMART, I  THINK HE SAID THE RIGHT THING. I THINK HE DIDN'T SPEAK NOT  BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE ANSWERS, I THINK HE DIDN'T SPEAK BECAUSE HE WAS JUDGING EVERYBODY ELSE  ON THEIR ANSWERS. THE FRENCH GUY, I DON'T KNOW  WHY HE WAS THERE. >> Adrienne: WELL, HE MET THE  CRITERIA.  >> AT LEAST HE WAS SMART.  >> Adrienne: WELL, IT'S ABOUT A PERCENTAGE -- IT'S ABOUT  SITTING M.P.s AND IT'S ABOUT  PERCENTAGE IN THE POLLS. TWO OF THE CRITERIA, AND IT'S  WHY THE GREENS WEREN'T THERE  BECAUSE OF THE CRITERIA. SO THE ADVANCES POLLS, I AM --  ADVANCED POLLS, I'M LOOKING AT  THE CLOCK. THEY OPEN VERY SHORTLY, AND  ANN, WE MIGHT AS WELL START  WITH YOU BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE  IT.  >> POLITICS IS EMOTIONAL, AND I THINK WE AS HUMAN BEINGS WE  MAKE EMOTIONAL DECISIONS. I THINK IT'S GOOD TO CHECK  YOURSELF AND SEE, RUN THROUGH  THE PLATFORMS AGAIN AND SEE,  LIKE, MY REAL -- WHICH REALLY  ALIGNS WITH ME AND WHICH SHOULD ALIGN WITH MY EMOTIONAL  REACTION. YOU CAN GO TO THE CBC VOTE  TRACKER AND WEIGH YOUR  PRIORITIES AND WHAT YOU CARE  MOST ABOUT. I WAS RELIEVED TO SEE THAT MY  GUT DID ALIGN WITH WHAT MY  PRIORITIES WERE FOR CANADA. I THINK TEST IT A LITTLE. DON'T GO WITH EMOTIONAL  RESPONSES, YEAH, THAT'S AN EASY OUT. >> Adrienne: LAST 30 SECONDS. EMMA, WE'LL START WITH YOU.  >> I THINK IN GOING TO THE  POLLS IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT CARNEY HAS ALL OF THE SAME POLICIES, PRETTY MUCH ALL OF  THE SAME POLICIES THAT WERE  BROUGHT IN BY THE LIBERAL  PARTY, THINGS LIKE BAIL REFORM  AND NO PIPELINES BUILT. THE ONLY ONE THAT HE SEEMED TO  BE BRAGGING ABOUT WAS HE DID  THE AXE THE CARBON TAX WHICH IS WHAT PIERRE HAD SAID MULTIPLE  TIMES FOR MANY YEARS. SO I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE IN A  POSITION THAT SIMPLY A CHANGE  OF FACE IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH OF A SOLUTION TO GET CANADA MOVING THE BACK DIRECTION. I HONESTLY BELIEVE ANY PARTY IS MORE DESERVING THAN THE LIBERAL PARTY. THEY'RE ADMITTING THAT WE'RE  HURTING, THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD  FOOD, THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD  HOUSING. THEY'VE BEEN IN POWER FOR TEN  YEARS, BUT NOW THEY'RE SAYING  THIS IS THE TIME THAT THEY  SHOULD FIX IT. WE ALL KNOW THAT THE LIBERAL  PARTY SHOULDN'T DESERVE ANOTHER SHOT AND I HOPE THAT PEOPLE SEE THAT AND GO TO THE POLLS AND  VOTE FOR ANY OTHER PARTY THAT  ASKS FOR CHANGE. >> Adrienne: NOW WE'VE GOT TO  GO. WE JUST ATE CHRIS' TIMES. IT IS -- IT WAS REALLY GREAT TO SEE ALL OF YOU. IT'S BEEN REALLY FUN. >>> SO TONIGHT'S DEBATE WAS THE LAST CHANCE FOR LEADERS TO  CHANGE THE COURSE OF THEIR >> YOU CLAIM TO BE VERY  DIFFERENT FROM MR. TRUDEAU. NOW THE POINT IS TO SHOW THAT  YOU ARE ANY BETTER THAN MR.  TRUDEAU. >> Adrienne: THAT IS THE LEADER OF THE BLOC QUEBECOIS JOINING  IN ON THE ATTACKS AGAINST MARK  CARNEY. IT WAS THE ONLY ENGLISH DEBATE  IN THIS CAMPAIGN AND THE  LIBERAL FRONT RUNNER WAS THE  CLEAR TARGET. SO WHAT COULD THIS MEAN FOR THE CAMPAIGN MOVING FORWARD? AS WE MOVE CLOSER TO ELECTION  DAY, ROSIE IS HERE WITH ""AT  ISSUE.""  >> THE GOVERNMENT HAS WEAKENED  OUR ECONOMY WITH ANTIENERGY  LAWS.  >> MR. POILIEVRE, YOU SPENT  YEARS RUNNING AGAINST JUSTIN  TRUDEAU AND THE CARBON TAX, AND BOTH OF THEM ARE GONE.  >> WHILE THIS ARGUMENT CAN BE  ABOUT WHO'S MORE PIPELINE, IT'S CLEAR. THE LIBERALS BOUGHT A PIPELINE, THEY BUILT A PIPELINE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT MR. POILIEVRE IS COMPLAINING ABOUT.  >> YOU CAN'T FILL PEOPLE'S  MINDS WITH NONSENSE. >> Rosemary: HI. I'M ROSEMARY BARTON AND THAT  WAS JUST A TASTE OF SOME OF THE ENGLISH DEBATE TONIGHT WITH  JUST UNDER TWO WEEKS UNTIL  ELECTION DAY. HAVE THE LEADERS MADE THEIR  CASE TO CANADIANS BEFORE THE  ELECTION. HERE WITH ME NOW, CHANTAL  HEBERT, ANDREW COYNE, AND  ALTHIA RAJ. LET'S SEE WHAT YOU MADE OF  TONIGHT. ANDREW, I'LL START WITH YOU.  >> I THINK PIERRE POILIEVRE  MADE SOME YARDS. I THINK HE HAD A GOOD NIGHT. HE WAS CONFIDENT, HE WAS  FLUENT. NOT JUST A CRITIC BUT HE WAS  ALSO OUTLINING HIS OWN PLAN, SO I THINK BY THE WAY YOU JUDGE  THESE STANDARDS, HE HAD A GOOD  NIGHT. MARK CARNEY SHOWS HIS  INEXPERIENCE. HE COMES ACROSS AS A NORMAL  PERSON. HE SEEMS TO BE AMUSED BY THE  PROCEEDINGS AS A NORMAL HUMAN  WOOD. IN NORMAL BECOMES, YOU DEFER IF SOMEBODY INTERRUPTS YOU OR YOU  DIRECT YOUR QUESTION TO THE  PERSON WHO ASKS IT. IN DEBATING, YOU CONTINUE TO  INTERRUPT, YOU DON'T ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED AND YOU DON'T TALK RIGHT TO THE  PRESENTER OR THE ASKER, YOU  TALK TO THE CAMERA. HOW IS THE PUBLIC GOING TO  MEASURE THAT? IS THE PUBLIC GOING TO SAY, HE  WASN'T AS GOOD OF A DEBATER AS  PIERRE POILIEVRE OR IS THE  PUBLIC GOING TO SAY, HE SOUNDS  LIKE A NORMAL PERSON WAS? >> Rosemary: YEAH, AND THAT'S  THE CONTEXT THAT WE'RE IN. CHANTAL? >> I WAS STRUCK BY THE FACT  FROM WHERE I WAS SITTING, AT  LEAST, MARK CARNEY AND PIERRE  POILIEVRE -- AND I DO AGREE  WITH ANDREW THAT PIERRE  POILIEVRE HAD A GOOD NIGHT, BUT IN THE END, THEIR EXCHANGES  DOMINATE THE DEBATE. THIS DEBATE DOES NOT MOVE US  AWAY FROM THE BINARY CHOICE  THAT THE SELECTION IS ABOUT,  WHICH IS WHICH OF THOSE TWO DO  YOU WANT? I THINK MARK CARNEY DIDN'T DO  ANYTHING THAT WOULD COST HIM  THE JOB BUT I THINK MR. PIERRE  POILIEVRE SHOULD HAVE DONE MORE THAT WOULD HAVE MADE HIM LOOK  MORE COMPETITIVE IN THAT KIND  OF A CONTEST. I DID SEE A LOT OF PUSH BACK ON INTERRUPTING ON MY FEEDS AND  THAT WAS DIRECTED AT JAGMEET  SINGH. YVES-FRANCOIS BLANCHET BROUGHT  HIS GOOD GAME TO THIS DEBATE  BUT I DON'T THINK HE FOUND A  HANDLE TO PITCH HIMSELF INSIDE  THE BINARY CHOICE IN THE WAY  THAT HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE  LIKED OR GOT TO DO THANKS TO  THE MODERATOR IN THE LAST  ELECTION. >> Rosemary: YEAH, I WOULD  AGREE WITH THAT. ALTHIA, YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHERE  WE ARE AFTER THAT ONE? >> I DON'T THINK I WOULD CHANGE ANYTHING. I THINK IF YOU'RE PART OF THEM, YOU WOULD AGREE THAT YOUR MAN  WON. I AGREE THAT POILIEVRE DID A  LOT BETTER TONIGHT THAN HE DID  LAST NIGHT. MARK CARNEY, HE LET A LOT OF  THINGS GO OR GO UNADDRESSED. POILIEVRE SAYING THAT MARK  CARNEY IS GOING TO BRING BACK  THE CARBON TAX AFTER THE  ELECTION. I THINK MR. POILIEVRE WAS GOOD  AT PLANTING SEEDS OF DOUBT FOR  MARK CARNEY, ETHICS OR ISSUES  THAT MR. CARNEY CHOSE NOT TO  RESPOND TO. I THINK ON THE INTERRUPTION  THING ON MR. SINGH, FRANKLY,  JAGMEET SINGH NEEDS TO  INTERRUPT. HE NEEDS TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT  HE'S STILL THERE. THIS TWO-HORSE RACE AT THE  MOMENT IS THAT NOBODY IS  TALKING ABOUT THE N.D.P. IN THE NARRATIVE, THE N.D.P.  HAS BEEN SQUEEZED OUT. I THOUGHT MR. SINGH DID A GOOD  JOB LAST NIGHT, AND HE DID A  GOOD JOB TONIGHT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE N.D.P.  REPRESENTATIVES ON THAT STAGE  AND WHY IT'S KIND OF A DISASTER FOR THE GREENS THAT THEY WERE  NOT ALLOWED TO BE ON THAT STAGE TONIGHT, AS WELL. >> IT'S FASCINATING THAT SO  MUCH OF HIS NEEDLING AND  INTERRUPTIONS WAS DIRECTED AT  PIERRE POILIEVRE AND MARK  CARNEY. IF I DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER I'D SWEAR THAT THEY'D CUT A DEAL. >> Rosemary: NOT YET, ANDREW,  NOT YET. >> CARNEY COULD STAND BACK AND  RISE ABOVE THE FRAY WHILE  JAGMEET SINGH DID HIS DIRTY  WORK ON PIERRE POILIEVRE. EVERYTHING ABOUT THE LIBERAL  STRATEGY THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN ABOUT IT'S ALL ABOUT TRUMP. IN THIS DEBATE, THAT WAS JUST  ONE ISSUE AMONGST MANY, AND SO  THE CONSERVATIVES GOT TO  PROSECUTE THEIR CASE ON A WHOLE HOST OF ISSUES, LIKE THE  ECONOMY AND HOUSING AND ETC. WOULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN GREAT IF  WE HAD MORE THAN ONE DEBATE IN  EACH LANGUAGE BEFORE THE  ELECTION? >> Rosemary: YEAH, ALTHIA, I'LL GO TO YOU. >> MR. POILIEVRE MENTIONED HOW  THE CBC BUILDING WOULD BE A  GREAT PLACE FOR AN AFFORDABLE  HOUSING, AND BASICALLY, WE  HEARD HIM TALKING ABOUT HOW THE CBC COULD MOVE TO A PBS MODEL. I THINK THAT HIS GOAL WAS TO  SOUND MORE PRIME MINISTERIAL  AND LOOK LESS LIKE AN ATTACK  DOG THAN WE'VE SEEN IN THE  HOUSE OF COMMONS, AND I DO  THINK HE DID THAT. I THINK THAT MARK CARNEY LOOKED LIKE THE ELDER STATESMAN, AND  HE ACCOMPLISHED THAT ROLE, AS  WELL. >> THE OUTCOME IS NEVER THE ONE ON THE OFFENSIVE. FOR THIS DEBATE TO CHANGE THE  OUTCOME, YOU WOULD HAVE TO  ASSUME THE N.D.P. AND THE BLOC  LAST NIGHT AND THE BLOC TONIGHT WON BACK VOTERS. I THINK PART OF POILIEVRE'S  STRATEGY WAS TO LOOK MORE  NUANCED. I THINK JAGMEET SINGH WANTS TO  SHOW THE NEW DEMOCRATS THAT HE  COULD STANDUP TO A PIERRE  POILIEVRE GOVERNMENT. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE  DYNAMICS OF THIS CAMPAIGNS ARE  SO DIFFERENT THAT THE POLLS  SHOW THAT THE CONSERVATIVES ARE BACK IN THE RACE, IT MIGHT JUST PUSH MORE PEOPLE WHO MAYBE  MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE BE BACK TO  THE LIBERALS. >> Rosemary: ALTHIA, LAST WORD  TO YOU.  >> I THINK IF YOU WERE COMING  AT THIS COLD ONE OF THE THINGS  THAT YOU MIGHT NOTICE IS HOW  SIMILAR A LOT OF THE POLICIES  COMING OUT OF PIERRE POILIEVRE  AND MARK CARNEY'S MOUTHS. IF WE DON'T GET THIS, IT'LL BE  THE END OF PLATFORMS FOR PARTY  LEADERS.  >> Rosemary: YEAH, I'LL LET YOU RESPOND TO THAT, QUICKLY. ANDREW. 30 SECONDS.  >> WELL, THERE'S A LOT OF  MAGICAL THINKING ON ALL SIDES. WE'VE GOT TWO CANDIDATES  COMMENTING ON AFFORDABILITY AND HOUSING AND NO WORD ABOUT  DEFENCE PLANNING. >> Rosemary: SHORT BREAK. >> Rosemary: WELCOME BACK. WITH THE LEADERS' DEBATES OVER  AND LESS THAN TWO WEEKS FROM  ELECTION DAY AND ADVANCED POLLS OPEN, WHAT COMES NEXT AND CAN  THE LEADERS CONVINCE PEOPLE TO  COME BACK? WITH ME, CHANTAL, ALTHIA, AND  ANDREW. I WANT TO DO ONE QUICK  ROUNDABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED A  LITTLE BIT MORE TONIGHT WITH  WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE SCRUMS  BEING SHUTDOWN BECAUSE THE  SECURITY COULDN'T GUARANTEE THE SAFETY AND SECURITY INSIDE THE  MEDIA ROOM AND ALL THE  ALTERNATE INDICATIONS THAT  HAPPENED HERE AND ELSEWHERE. WHAT HAS THIS DONE NOW TO THE  CREDIBILITY OF THE COMMISSION,  CHANTAL, IF ANYTHING, AND IS  THAT SOMETHING THAT CANADIANS  COULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT? >> I DO THINK THAT CANADIANS  SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE  COMMISSION THAT HAS ORGANIZED  THEM, SETS UP DEBATES THREE  TIMES IN A ROW, AND HAS MANAGED TO HAVE SCREW-UPS EVERY SINGLE  TIME, THIS TIME BEATING EVERY  OTHER TIME. THE DEBATES, AS FAR AS THEY  WERE CONCERNED, WERE FINE, BUT  LET'S BE FRANK, THE PEOPLE WHO  MADE THEM FINE WERE THE  MODERATORS. STEVE PAIKIN TONIGHT REALLY  KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING. THE CHANGING THE TIME BECAUSE  YOU DON'T THINK THAT THE HOCKEY TIME MATTERS WHEN YOU SET THE  TIME OF THE FRENCH LANGUAGE  DEBATE, AND THE DECISION TO  GIVE ACCREDITATION TO A HALF  DOZEN PEOPLE FROM MEDIA  ORGANIZATIONS THAT THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT HAS SAID ARE NOT  LEGITIMATE MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS  IN THE DEFINITION OF THE TERM,  AND THEN BEING SURPRISED AT  WHAT HAPPENS. THE REBEL NEWS AND TRUE NORTH,  IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE FROM THE  RIGHT, THEY'RE FROM, ONE, THE  EXTREME RIGHT, AND TWO, THEY  ARE REGISTERED WITH ELECTIONS  CANADA AS A THIRD PARTY GROUP  THAT PUBLICIZES STANCES ON  ISSUES, AND THIS CAMPAIGN, I  DON'T THINK THE CBC AND  RADIO-CANADA HAS REGISTERED AS  A CAMPAIGN. >> Rosemary: ANDREW? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, ALL  CHANTAL'S POINTS ARE WELL  TAKEN. I DO WANT TO ACCENTUATE TWO  THINGS. THESE ARE TWO OF THE BEST  DEBATES THAT I'VE SEEN,  PARTICULARLY THE ENGLISH  LANGUAGE DEBATE. IF THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE ALL  THE STICKS AND ARROWS FOR  EVERYTHING THAT WENT WRONG, IT  WAS A FINE DEBATE.  >> Rosemary: BUT THAT WAS A  PITCH THAT WAS MADE TO THE  LEADERS COMMISSION AND IT WAS  DECIDED ON CBC AND  RADIO-CANADA. >> AND IT WAS HOW WE USED TO DO DEBATES BEFORE THE COMMISSION. >> Rosemary: THAT'S RIGHT. SORRY, ANDREW, FOR INTERRUPTING YOU.  >> THAT'S OKAY. PARTICULARLY ON ADMITTING REBEL NEWS IN HERE, I THINK WE'VE  JUST ENTERED THE FINAL NAIL IN  THE COFFIN FOR THESE GUYS. THESE ARE PERFORMANCE ARTISTS,  THEY'RE GRIFTERS. THEY STAKEOUT A COMPLETELY  UNHINGED PARTISAN POSITION AND  THEN SAY IF ANYONE AGREES WITH  THIS ARE JUST PARTISAN IN  ANOTHER DIRECTION. JOURNALISTS MAKE MISTAKES, WE  STRUGGLE IN OUR JOB, BUT WE'RE  TRYING TO DO OUR JOB AND  PRESENT AS ACCURATE A PICTURE  OF WHAT GOES ON. THEY'RE NOT EVEN TRYING, AND  THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE. >> Rosemary: ALTHIA, LAST WORD  TO YOU ON THIS.  >> WELL, THERE'S SO MUCH GOING  ON ON THIS. I ACTUALLY THINK WE NEED THE  LEADERS COMMISSION. I WILL REMIND THE REASON THAT  WE HAVE THIS COMMISSION IS  PRIME MINISTER STEPHEN HARPER  DECIDED HE DID NOT WANT TO GO  TO THE CONSORTIUM DEBATE IN  2015. AT LEAST WE HAD DID HE BAITS  AND WE -- DEBATES, A WHOLE  BUNCH OF THEM, BUT WE DIDN'T  HAVE ONE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL OF  THE COUNTRY. I THINK THIS IS A DECISION THAT THE COMMISSION AND THE STAFF AT THE COMMISSION HAS MADE. I THINK EXCLUDING A POLITICAL  PARTY WITH TWO ELECTED M.P.s IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS THE  MORNING OF THE DEBATE IS  INSANE. THE EXACT THAT THEY CREDITED  FIVE REPORTERS, REALLY  ACTIVISTS, AS CHANTAL POINTED  OUT, THEY ARE REGISTERED THIRD  PARTIES WITH ELECTIONS CANADA. SO THEY HAVE REGISTERED  THEMSELVES SAYING THEY ARE  GOING TO BE ADVOCATING FOR  ISSUES OR POLITICAL PARTIES. THAT'S NOT AN INDEPENDENT  JOURNALISTIC ORGANIZATION EVEN  IF THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL  THEMSELVES. THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS TO  BE ASKED BUT LET'S NOT THROW  THE BABY OUT WITH THE  BATHWATER.  >> I AGREE.  >> Rosemary: YEAH, I THINK WE  ALL AGREE IT WAS A GOOD TWO  DEBATES AND CREDIT TO ALL THE  PEOPLE THAT PUT THAT TOGETHER. >>> I HAVE ABOUT 30 SECONDS TO  EACH OF YOU, THE NEXT TEN DAYS.

So glad you can join us. Here's what's happening. A day of stress and uncertainty for the auto industry. I'll do everything I can to to protect the people and their jobs. Signs of relief after fearing the worst. They can't trust anything is real anymore. New promises of protection on the campaign trail. was a surge of migrants seeking asylum in Canada. CTV National News with Sandy Ronaldo. Shock waves rumbled through Canada's auto industry following a Japanese report that Honda is considering shifting production from Canada and Mexico to the US. But then industry minister Anita Anan said she's in contact with the automaker and no production decision affecting Canada has been discussed. Ontario's Premier Doug Ford added he's been told by Honda the report is inaccurate. Still, the sector has been on edge since Donald Trump imposed 25% tariffs on cars headed to the US. Let's bring in CTV's Adrien Gobriel. And Adrien, where do things stand now then? Sandy, today Honda joined government officials by pouring cold water on the report out of Japan. Though for auto workers, this just adds to the uncertainty for an entire industry that has been teetering since Trump's auto tariffs were announced. Since 1986, Honda has maintained manufacturing operations in Canada. The number one selling car in Canada is a Honda. has been for about 40 years, which made this news report out of Japan today even more shocking for the more than 4,200 workers who assembled the Honda CRV and Civic in Alist, Ontario. In a statement to CTV News, Honda says, ""Our Canadian manufacturing facility will operate at full capacity for the foreseeable future, and no changes are being considered at this time. We constantly study options for future contingency planning and utilize short-term production shift strategies when required to mitigate negative impacts on our business. So, no changes right now, but potentially in the future. We may see some CRV production move to um uh the US to serve a US customer, but there is also a lot of CRV and civic uh access demand in Canada. If you see some CRV move, you'll likely see some civic move back in. The news comes with Ontario's auto industry in flux. Stalantis and Windsor paused operations due to Trump's tariffs. GM has laid off hundreds in Ingresol, Ontario. While the company claims that move isn't tariff related, the impact to the surrounding communities is significant. Small business owners in Allist are now bracing for the unknown. If we lose over 4,000 jobs, where, you know, where are our customers coming from? These are the types of jobs that feed families, pay the mortgage, put kids through school. Honda says it's never laid off a single worker from its Allist plant, where in April of last year, the auto giant announced a historic $15 billion investment to build a comprehensive EV battery plant, which is currently underway. Automotive industry leaders who've been canvasing US officials on behalf of Canadian auto workers say we're months, if not at least a year away from knowing where the dust will settle on Trump's auto tariff war. Sandy. All right, Adrian, thank you. Now, of course, there was immediate reaction on the campaign trail when the story broke, including a liberal promise to spare automakers from some tariffs. CTV senior political correspondent Mike Lucur now with what was said about what could have been an economic sideswipe. Sandy Mark Carney wanted to talk about his plan to retrain workers in the face of US tariffs, but it was the economic domino effect that took center stage instead. It's it's a war. A simple description for the otherwise complicated trade dispute. With Honda's decision unclear in the morning, the Liberal leader laid out how Canadian incentives should help automakers keep production on this side of the border. They will get a 100% remission on our counter tariffs. So in other words, our counter tariffs won't apply if they continue to produce, continue to employ, continue to invest in Canada. If they don't, they will get 25% tariffs on what they are importing into Canada. Okay? So the incentives are there. Having spoken to the president of Honda, Ontario Premier Doug Ford downplayed reports of the automaker moving production. Well, we're going to keep Honda here and I'll do everything I can to to protect the people and their jobs. Thank you very much, everyone. It's Polyv condemned US President Donald Trump for imposing tariffs on Canada's auto sector, which could see companies consider moving production south. The Conservative leader was firm on what he would do in response. We we should not uh lift counter tariffs. NDP leader Jug meet Singh expressed concern for the auto workers who are caught in the middle and he wants to see safeguards put in place to keep those jobs in this country. If you're going to sell a car in Canada, you have to have a footprint in Canada. Meaning you have to make cars here or you have to have jobs here. On a day when leaders were supposed to be preparing to debate topics like the cost of living and climate change, it was the trade war and its impacts that overshadowed everything else again. Sandy Michael Couture. Now, Pierre Palev was also promising to crack down on scams targeting seniors. The conservative leader saying as prime minister he would force banks and the big telecom companies to help him do it. CTV's Rachel Ayello is with the Conservatives. And Rachel, how does PROLI have plan to follow through on this? Sandy, seniors in this country are 33% more likely to lose money in a scam compared to other age groups. And today, the Conservative leader promised new laws to protect them. One call, one click, and it's gone. Backed by a row of seniors, today Pierre Polyv pledged his government would make it tougher for scammers to take their money. Taking aim at lacking enforcement of anti-fraud laws, the Conservatives want to require banks and telecom providers to in real time detect, report, and block suspected fraud, such as fishing texts and roocalls targeting customers over the age of 65. Our seniors deserve to feel safe and secure when they pick up their phones, iPads, or computers. The Conservatives would also put a 24-hour delay on high-risk transactions from seniors accounts, forcing banks to call to ensure they're not being swindled. Hello. Failing to implement scamrevention measures could result in heavy penalties. Polyv is also promising to create a new criminal offense, targeting executives for willful blind profitering from senior scams while also imposing tougher sentences and fines for fraudsters. In recent years, thousands of Canadian seniors have reported being scammed, losing millions. The scammer was so convincing. All of a sudden, I realized I was broke. I could have been doing so much with my money, but like it's gone. The Liberals and New Democrats have also made senior centric commitments during this campaign, but not specifically on scam prevention. The conservatives targeting this demographic today comes as Nanos numbers show Canadians ages 55 and older far prefer Mark Carney to Polyv. Sandy Rachel Iello. The NDP leader also took aim at his political rivals today for scrapping plans to increase the capital gains tax which the Trudeau government introduced and Mark Carney reversed. CTV's Abigail Bean is here now to share how Jug meet Singh is framing the issue. Abigail Sandy, it was the Trudeau Liberals that first introduced the capital gains tax changes in the last budget. So unpopular, Christa Freeland, who introduced it as finance minister, committed to dropping it in her bid for Liberal leadership. And Liberal leader Mark Carney scrapped it, too. Capital gains are money you make when you sell an investment. Stocks, business assets, investment properties. The Trudeau policy increased the portion of capital gains you pay tax on from 50 to 67% for the amount earned over a quarter million. There was criticism it would stave off investments in Canada at a time when the country should be doubling down on growth in the face of threats from the United States and criticism that it may actually target the middle class rather than the ultra rich. In this campaign, both the Liberal and Conservative leaders vowed to be done with the policy. Singh wants to bring it back, saying it will mean$19 billion dollars over 5 years that the government could use for things like hospital improvements, like the one he was standing in front of in Montreal to make his announcement. CTV News asked, saying why he's pushing for something that had been so unpopular. the entire Liberal Party was in favor of it, was defending it, said it was a great thing to do, and then all of a sudden flip-flopped on it. So, I think that they took they did the wrong thing. Um, we've seen that the only way you actually guarantee investment in the country is by having strings attached. Giving blank checks to companies does not actually create investment. Like all party leaders, Singh will now be focused on debate prep with the French debate taking place here tomorrow night. Abigail Bean, CTV News, Montreal. Okay, Abigail. Thanks. Now, the time of that French debate where leaders face off in Montreal has been changed because of an actual faceoff involving the Montreal Canadians. That debate now takes place at 6:00 p.m. Eastern instead of 8:00 p.m. The NDP block had asked for a change because of a pivotal hockey game that could see the Halves clinch a spot in the Stanley Cup playoffs. Well, gamesmanship will be front and center tomorrow when a Japanese trade delegation arrives in Washington. At the same time, Donald Trump is hinting at a potential auto tariff pause. But in Washington today, talk focused on the Maryland father mistakenly deported to El Salvador. But what also got our attention was the answer to a question about Canada. CTV's Washington bureau chief Joy Malban joins us. Okay, Joy, let's start with what the White House press secretary had to say when she was asked about Donald Trump's position on Canada. You know, Sandy, the president has said a lot about Canada, especially as this nasty trade war plays out. A few weeks ago, though, it seemed that Donald Trump was showing us some respect, even referring to Mark Carney as prime minister, no derogatory remarks. But as the press secretary confirmed today, Trump still dreams of annexing Canada. Here's the press secretary. The president still maintains his position on Canada. The United States has been subsidizing Canada's national defense and he believes that Canadians would benefit greatly from becoming the 51st state of the United States of America. As for autos and auto parts, I don't have anything to read out for you there, but I think the point the president was making is flexibility. Um, and he has flexibility when it comes to negotiations and talks. So, flexibility, Joy, let's pick up on that because talk to us about the case of the man mistakenly sent to a prison in El Salvador. Is the White House flexible or still defiant about sending him away? Very much defiant. The White House is in a standoff with the courts right now and this is testing the limits of Donald Trump's presidential power. Uh there's this gentleman, Kilar Abrego Garcia. He is at the center of this fight. Now, the Trump administration admitted that they deported the Maryland father to an El Salvador prison by mistake. Now, Garcia has not been convicted of a crime there or here. And the Supreme Court ordered the White House to facilitate his return. They have not done so. And yesterday, the Salvadorian president said he doesn't have the power to return him either. Now, a court hearing today, a district court judge actually scolded the Justice Department lawyers for doing quote nothing to bring Garcia back. And it's also weighing contempt charges against the Trump administration. But the White House, they see it differently. Take a listen. Abrego Garcia was a foreign terrorist. He is an MS13 gang member. He was engaged in human trafficking. He illegally came into our country. And so deporting him back to El Salvador was always going to be the end result. There is never going to be a world in which this is an individual who's going to live a peaceful life in Maryland. Sandy, the Trump administration is digging into its hardline deportation policy. Sandy. Okay. Joy. Now, the ramping up of those deportation efforts by the Trump administration has led to a surge in asylum seekers at the Canada US border. Over the past two weeks, claimments, most of them of Haitian origin, have been making their way north, particularly to Quebec. CTV's Quebec bureau chief Jvia Boschman is at the same Bernard de La border point and Jen you have some new numbers to share with us. Yes and a change of policy by US President Donald Trump is pushing more and more migrants to try and seek refuge here on Canadian soil. There are some visible signs of that jump in the number of asylum seekers here. The Canadian Border Services Agency has brought in additional personnel. Now the surge is actually quite recent. Here's the latest data that we've obtained. This year, the number of claimants across the country has actually been down significantly, 53% less compared to 2024. But since April 1st, 1,411 people have claimed asylum at the San Bernarda land crossing. Now, compare that to the same period last year. The number was 319. This has several organizations and community groups scrambling to find resources to help with basic needs like food and housing. Klet Kazavan of the family support center mama papa says resources are already stretched thin. Most of the people seeking refuge here are from Haiti and had been living in the US under special programs that suspended deportations but the US president ended the programs and a letter went out to Haitians without status asking them to leave the country by April 24th. The number of asylum seekers had gone down significantly since 2023 since the third safe country agreement was extended to the entire border. Now that agreement forces asylum seekers to make their claim in the US if they enter that country first. And so many of those who actually show up here are turned around and sent back to the United States. But there are exceptions including for those who have close family in Canada. Sandy Shviv, thank you. Coming up after the break, relief from financial pressure. CTV's chief financial correspondent will be here to share the good [Music] news. Well, inflation in Canada surprisingly eased last month, helped by lower gas prices and a drop in travel to the US. The inflation rate was at 2.3% in March, down from 2.6% 6% in February. Now, the data comes a day before the Bank of Canada makes its next interest rate decision. Joining us now, CTV's chief financial correspondent, Amanda Lang. And Amanda, slowing inflation is a good thing, right? Always nice to see prices not gaining as quickly. A bit of a Trump effect here with both travel and gas prices seeing the results of the turmoil. And we should note that the Trump tariffs, such as they are, haven't shown up in prices yet, Sandy. So, that is still ahead of us. Okay. What is also ahead of us is the Bank of Canada decision tomorrow. All eyes on what it will do. So what's the expectation? Rates going down. Well, the betting has been actually that the bank holds steady does nothing because of the uncertainty about what happens with tariffs and pricing. Will it cause inflation in this country? However, today you saw the odds shift a little bit in favor of a cut. So if that's what people are really hoping for, there's a slight tilt in that favor. partly because lack of inflation does give the bank a little bit more wiggle room to cut rates and of course that would be the rate that will set a lot of costs for a lot of people. All right, Amanda, thank you. Well, some love for Canada coming your way. California Governor Gavin Newsome is extending an olive branch or in this case a redwood branch to Canadians because here in California, we've got plenty of sunshine and a whole lot of love for our neighbors up north. Newsome launched the campaign hoping to encourage Canadians to visit the state. The governor's team says the message is in response to the recent drop in tourism to California as a result of Donald Trump's policies. Newsome says 2 million Canadians visited last year and signs of friendship are popping up in Vancouver. An American who wants to remain anonymous is trying to send us a very sincere message. I thought how delightful that somebody is actually going to put their money where their mouth is and say how appalling all this is. The unnamed American has bought advertising space to apologize. The billboard show the Maple Leaf with the words, ""Dear Canada, we are so very, very, very sorry. Signed your American friends."" The US citizen who bought the advertising space told CTV News they wish to remain anonymous, so the message isn't about one single person saying sorry. Coming up on CTV National News, I'm Allison Bamford in Swift Current, Saskatchewan. What struggling businesses want from a new government. Our customers feel it. We feel it. And why those in Saskatchewan fear their vote won't make a difference. There are feelings of western alienation in this part of the province. That story coming up. Police are on the hunt for a suspect after multiple people were injured in an apparent hit and run in downtown Toronto this afternoon. A car crashed into four people in a pedestrian-only route at a local university. Two were rushed to hospital, one with serious injuries, two others were treated on the scene. Officers are now looking for a dark green sedan with a cracked windshield which was seen fleeing the area. A standoff is brewing between Harvard University and the Trump administration. The president made it clear to Harvard, ""Follow federal law. no longer break Title Six, which was passed by Congress to ensure no student can be discriminated against on the basis of race. Um, and you will receive federal funding. The Ivy League school is the first major university to reject White House demands. They include sweeping changes to admissions like student screening for anti-semitism and terrorism and making changes to existing diversity hiring practices. The Trump administration announced it is freezing more than $2 billion in grants. Disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was back in a Manhattan courtroom today. Jury selection was underway for Weinstein's retrial on sex crime charges. The New York Court of Appeals overturned his 2020 rape convictions, ruling that accusers who were not part of the charges should not have been allowed to testify. Weinstein was found guilty of rape and sexual assault in 2022 in California and sentenced to 16 years. And visitors to the famed Notraam Cathedral in Paris marked six years since a devastating fire that led to a remarkable restoration. It's very emotional and it's wonderful that they were able to restore it. The massive inferno destroyed the famous roof and iconic spire. Now the restored cathedral welcomes an average of 30,000 visitors a day. CTV National News continues in a moment. Don't go away. Swift current Saskatchewan is a small city with a big city feel, a community that can boast a thriving local business sector. But even the most successful are struggling these days. We sent CTV's Allison Bamfort to a hot spot in Swift Current to hear the concerns during this election campaign. A warm, windy spring day in Swift Current signals the end of the winter bowling season. It's the last day of play for the Club 55 league. On the lanes, they don't usually talk politics. We're just here to have a good time. John Fzen turns 100 in September. He's the one to beat. He's thrown five strikes in a row. Much like his bowling game, he says he can't complain about the federal government. We've always had a good government here. They give good pensions. But for his competition, Jackie Coward, there are concerns. Affordability and the rising cost of living top her list. I really watch what I have to buy. It's just gone crazy. Prices are up everywhere, including the social bowl. It'll be 920 with taxes. Owner Tegan Gator says small businesses like hers are just trying to keep up with inflation, taxes, and now tariffs. Our customers feel it. We feel it. It makes it hard to to make any money. Some people told me they don't vote. Living in a conservative stronghold, they say they can already predict the outcome. Others say they don't feel their vote matters in a first pass the post system. The election is over when it passes Ontario. We don't have anything to say about the election really. There are feelings of western alienation in this part of the province. A helpless feeling for voters, but Swift current council is hopeful whoever forms government will continue funding municipal projects. The big issue right now is recreational facilities and we have an aging aquatic facility that uh that has been good to our community, but it's old. Back at the bowling alley, they're focused on their game and just like the federal election, they won't dwell on the results. Allison Bamford, CTV News, Swift Current.

If China continues to retaliate, it's not good for China. the global impact of the escalating spat between Beijing and Washington. They need to start purchasing those vehicles. Plus, a temporary shutdown as a GM plant hits the brakes. [Music] CTV National News with Heather Butts. Economic warning signs are flashing beyond just the volatile stock market. That was the message from Prime Minister Mark Carney today as he took a day off from the campaign trail to meet with his cabinet on Canada US relations with Donald Trump's global tariff policy having farreaching implications. CTV's Judy Tren now on what Carney described as a good long discussion with his cabinet. Judy Heather, this is the third time that Mark Carney has detourred off the campaign trail to deal with tariffs. The first two times he announced actions that the government would take. Not this time. It's not working. One by one the ministers of the Canada US Cabinet Council arrived to meet but only the prime minister would speak. A lot of developments uh in terms of UF US tariff policy. But there wasn't much to update about what Canada is doing. The country still faces US tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos and has already announced retaliatory actions. Nothing changed for Canada when Donald Trump paused global reciprocal tariffs earlier this week. The real negotiations begin after the election. We left uh instructions for officials to ensure that the next government uh whichever government uh Canadians choose will be in the best possible position for negotiations with the United States which as uh the president and I have agreed will begin uh from the start of May. Carney did not take questions. Around the same time production at the GM plant in Ingresol was halted. about 500 people are facing layoffs. Pierre Palv posted on social media as soon as the news broke. He said he was incredibly saddened and that a conservative government would push hard to put an end to these tariffs and be there for auto workers in Ingresol. The Conservative leader has previously downplayed Carney's ability to deal with Trump. Prime Minister Carney is running his entire campaign on a false promise that he can control the president through magical, masterful negotiating techniques. The Stalantis plant in Windsor has also hit pause. One autoworker job in this city impacts six others at this restaurant. That's on the minds of staff. Usually a pretty uh devout NDP voter. Unfortunately, at the federal level, um it often feels the it feels like I need to vote strategically. The next leader should definitely take a focus um on Canadian keeping jobs here, making sure that we're more self-reliant. Tonight, Pierre Polyv will hold a rally in Windsor where auto plant shutdowns are the main concern. Mark Carney and Jugme Singh have visited the border city before, but are back in Ottawa now. Heather. All right, Judy. Thank you. And sticking with news out of the auto industry, a General Motors plant in Ingresol, Ontario is shutting down temporarily. The automaker says the decision is not tariff related, but layoffs are set to begin on Monday. CTV's Heather Ray joins us from Ingressol. Heather, what are you hearing from union officials there? Well, they say it was a really tough day at the Cammy plant here in Ingresol, Ontario. They they say it's really been a tough several years. They've been dealing with COVID with the shutdown at the Ambassador Bridge, chip shortages, and now news that this plant is going to shut down starting on Monday. The good news is it is a temporary shutdown. They hope is for it to be back up and running in the fall, but layoffs will happen then. There's going to be a smaller workforce when the plant does get up and running. Here's what Ontario Premier Doug Ford had to say about the plant when he was asked a little earlier today. what I understand from the president of uh General Motors that I spoke to, it's going to be about 500 employees. Has nothing to do with the tariffs. He said the the volume uh is not there. People are not purchasing like they thought they would. So, they have uh thousands of vehicles uh sitting there. We're going to make sure we support the workers and uh make sure that we get government, especially Canada Post to pick up some of these vehicles because that's what it's geared for. And Heather GM says this isn't tariff related, but other plants are certainly being affected. Bring us up to speed on the latest from the auto sector in Ontario. Well, you heard Judy mention the Stellantis plant in Windsor, Ontario. That of course is the big one. It was shut down for two weeks. Now, we are hearing from the Unifor local there that Stalantis has informed them that they are going to be opening back up for two shifts a day starting April 21st. But beyond that, they haven't given any promises past two weeks. So certainly a very uncertain time to be an auto worker here in Ontario. Heather CTV's Heather Wright. Thank you. Chinese leader Xi Jinping said today he's quote not afraid in reference to his country's escalating trade war with the United States. China increased tariffs on US goods to 125% but said it wouldn't go any higher. The White House, meanwhile, suggesting it's still open to a deal. CTV's Washington bureau chief Joy Malvin is listening closely to the wording coming from the White House. Joy, where do things stand now? Well, Heather, the president's taking his annual physical today. When he took the oath of office, he became the oldest president at 78. However, he is posting and he's saying that his tariff policy is going well, even as China hit back raising those tariffs on American imports. Now, President Xi weighing in for the first time. He said that there are no winners in a trade war. And he won't cave to what Beijing calls Trump's bullying, calling it all a joke. Yesterday, Trump acknowledged there will be economic pain. China is one of the top suppliers here to America. Phones, clothes, furniture, toys. But the White House says Trump remains optimistic a deal can be done. But who picks up the phone first? Here's the White House press secretary. The tariff rate on China remains where it was yesterday at the 145% level. The president made it very clear when the United States is punched, he will punch back harder. Um, and he hopes to make a deal that benefits the American worker and our companies that have been ripped off for far too long. And he's finally taking bold and courageous action to do that. All right, Joy, switching to another story that you're watching for us. The ongoing saga of a Maryland man, Kilmar Garcia. He was accidentally deported to El Salvador and the US Supreme Court says the administration needs to bring him back. Yeah. The Trump administration admits it wrongfully deported a Maryland man to that notorious El Salvador prison housing gang members back in March. Now, his wife and family have been fighting to have him return. The Supreme Court agreed, ruling against the Trump administration, saying that they must facilitate the release of Kilmar Garcia. But the Justice Department says it needs more time defying the court's order. Here's the White House again. The Supreme Court uh made their ruling last night very clear um that it's the administration's um responsibility to facilitate u the return, not to affffectuate the return. I believe the Department of Justice just filed another brief in the lower court. I would defer you to that for any updates. After a tense hearing today, the US US District judge scolded the Trump administration, ordering daily updates on what the government is doing to return Mr. Garcia to his home here. Heather. All right, Joy. Thank you. New poll numbers point to an east versus west divide as the Liberals widen their lead over the Conservatives to six points. In Eastern Canada, it's all about the Liberals. in the west, you know, the prairie provinces, the conservative heartland, the conservatives, you know, are ahead by more than 20 percentage points. And BC is a tossup. The Nanos research poll shows the Liberals up to 43.6% and the Conservatives slightly down to 37.8% while the NDP is at 8.7%. Is this your last election? I'm focused on the campaign in front of me. Canada works best when one party doesn't have all the power. Jugme Singh sideststepped questions about his future as the leader of the new Democrats. In recent days, Singh has dropped his pitch to be the next prime minister, but insists Canadians need his party in Ottawa to hold the government to account. Conservative leader Pier Polyv presented his plan to stimulate the economy today and wrapped it up in messaging reminiscent of former Prime Minister Steven Harper. It comes just a day after a former Harper staffer blasted Polyv for blowing a major lead in the polls. CTV's Rachel Ayello joins us. Rachel, how is Polyv framing today's announcement. Heather, today Conservative leader Pierre Polyv presented a repackaged suite of some of his major election promises that he is now billing as a Harper era economic action plan 2.0. It's a Canada First economic action plan. It's a plan the Conservative Party hopes would boost Canada's economic activity by $500 billion over the next 5 years. It includes Pierre Polyv's promises to unlock resources, offer tax cuts, and empower entrepreneurs. That he is branding it as a revival of Canada's last conservative prime minister's economic action plan is also notable. It will be modeled in a lot of ways off the incredible success that Steven Harper had in the 0809 crisis. And that's why I'm rolling out that plan today. Harper's version was similarly a package of policies aimed at promoting economic growth after the recession and signs promoting the projects funded under it dotted build sites across the country for years. Being prime minister is a trust. After the former prime minister endorsed his former parliamentary secretary in this election, hearkening back to the Harper era appears to be a strategy Polyv's campaign plans to keep up. But one of Harper's former top staffers, we blew a 25point lead. Has also been highly critical of the current conservative campaign. Yeah. When I talk about campaign malpractice blowing a lead that big and uh and your response being I don't believe in the polls, I don't know. I think it's kind of weak sauce. Asked to respond today to that comment about his lost lead in the polls, Polyv pushed back. Liberals and lobbyists want to focus, want me to stop talking about high food prices. Well, I'm not going to do that. Polyv went on in that answer to suggest he has no plans to stop talking about affordability issues on the trail. as he makes his case for a new government. It's taking a page out of the playbook of an old one. Heather. All right, Rachel. Thank you. For more, let's bring in CTV's chief political correspondent, Vashy Capello. Vashy, let's start with that clip that we just heard from Steven Harper's former director of communications. The conservatives seeing some real criticism from within their own political field this week. Yeah, they're certainly not happy with those comments. And I think maybe even more relevant is that Corey Tanike, whom you heard from, wasn't just the spokesperson for Steven Harper uh on the 2015 campaign, he managed Doug Ford's most recent successful campaign in Ontario. So him taking aim at this campaign has weight to it in you heard Rachel describe how the Polyv campaign is pushing back. I think she's absolutely right in her assessment that likely they are not going to be changing tactics. They believe the issue of affordability remains central to Canadians and I imagine they will stay on that track. All right. And Vashy, I want to get your takeaways from this week as we look towards the debates next week. Well, the take the takeaway I have, Heather, is certainly around the comments that you aired from Jugmeat saying there was a real pivot on the NDP campaign to talk more about becoming a strong opposition to whomever forms government, which I think solidifies this as really a two-horse race. Pierre Polyv versus Mark Carney. They have a ton of policies that are similar, so the attention will be on the men, their tone, their tenor, their ability to deliver on the promises, which I think heightens the significance of this week's debate. Heather, and we'll certainly have full coverage and be looking for your analysis on that as well. Vashy, thank you. Coming up, bracing for a dip in tourism. Out of a 100 cars, I've only seen like one New York plate. We weren't really thinking about that coming to Canada. Growing concerns that Americans will stop heading [Music] north. We are learning more about the tragic crash after a tourist helicopter appeared to break up midair over New York City and plunge into the Hudson River. The rotator blades uh definitely flew off. The tail was not there by the time you could see it. uh by the time by the time you uh realize that it disintegrated, the tail was not to be found. New video and witness accounts show the helicopter appearing to break apart in the sky. Six people were killed, including a family of five from Spain and the pilot. The family was on a sightseeing trip while celebrating a daughter's 9th birthday. The investigation into what caused the crash is ongoing. And three people are dead and another person is injured after a small plane crashed in Boca Raton, Florida. Cell phone video captured the plane flying low and erratically before it crashed on a busy street near the Bokeh airport. The FAA said the plane was headed to Tallahassee International Airport, but it appeared to circle back. The cause of the crash will be investigated. Canada's summer tourism season is just around the corner. The usual wave of travelers from the US help boost local economies right across the country, but there's growing concern visitor numbers could dip because of the trade war and negativity between the two countries. CTV's Paul Hollingsworth has been speaking with people in the tourism industry. And Paul, what are you hearing? Well, Heather, tourism operators are bracing for a possible dip in visitation, but they're also spreading a message that Americans are still welcome in our country. Tourism season will soon ramp up along the Halifax waterfront, but US visitors are already flocking to Niagara Falls. Some Americans arrived with questions about how they would be received by Canadians. I know some of our friends mentioned that, you know, if we were a little worried, but how's the reception? How's people treating you? It's pretty good. Yeah, I have noticed it a little bit. Um, every time I come here, I always like to check parking lots and stuff like, ""Okay, where's everybody from?"" I think out of a 100 cars, I've only seen like one New York plane. Tourism operator Dennis Campbell is hearing some Americans are nervous about traveling to Canada. You know, we've been monitoring it very closely with our reservation staff. In fact, the the Ontario Tourism Association monitors this monthly. They take samples throughout the US and it it didn't show up uh until this month. A new poll shows Americans likely have nothing to worry about, especially if they visit the Nova Scotia capital. A combined 75% of people living in Halifax say they will be either more or as welcoming as they were in the past. If someone comes and they support Trump and the person here doesn't support Trump, um they're worried about those kind of conversations. But in general, the vast majority of people say they'll be welcoming. This uncertainty around American visitors comes at a time when tourism operators in this province were anticipating a busy summer travel season. Based on bookings, visitation could increase by as much as 40% compared to 2024. We will watch those numbers closely to see if there is a dip in the near future. Heather, CTV's Paul Hollingsworth along the Halifax waterfront. Thanks, Paul. Still ahead, welcome to the Habs. The fan frenzy for a highly anticipated Russian [Music] rookie. If you're a Habs fan, then rookie Ivan Demidov needs no introduction. The Montreal Canadians announced this week the signing of the 19-year-old Russian forward to the utter jubilation of fans. CTV Java Bushman has more on the craze sweeping the city. Evidence of Montreal's peak demod craze unfolded at Toronto's Pearson airport. We love you. Fans rushed to greet Canadians rookie Ivan Demidov as he touched down on Canadian soil. The 19-year-old Russian player's flight was for a time the most tracked in the world. Oh my my. Now Montrealers are eager for him to hit the ice. very excited to see him here and we're looking forward to seeing him in a Habs jersey and on the ice. Now the stars have aligned for Demidov to be a demigod to devoted Canadians fans. Ivan Demid at the 2024 NHL entry draft Quebec icon Selen Zio announced the Halves had drafted the winger with impressive stats in a unbelievable city like Monreal. It's it's crazy. Demid was playing on Russian ice, not expected to be released until next season. But his arrival was magically, some say, moved up just as chances of the Canadians making the playoffs rose. Businesses like Sports Crescent are scrambling to score merchandise to meet demand. I got called. I got the visit. People asking for the the t-shirt or the jersey. I said the t-shirt will be available by Monday, but the jersey next year. Not all highly anticipated rookies have lived up to expectations, though. Take even the great Gilafl. He didn't have the first explosive season many had hoped for. Demidov's teammates have his back, working to ease the pressure. Fans can be excited, but it's important to to temper expectations as well. You know, it's it's it's going to be he's going to be learning a lot. But turning down this fever pitch enthusiasm isn't easy at a time when so many say they need good news. Jean Via Bosme, CTV News, Montreal. [Music] Coming up on CTV National News, I'm Adrian Gorriel in Godrich, Ontario. This is the most important election out of any. From healthcare to housing insecurity, it's a great big vicious revolving circle. Why the number of people sleeping on the street has become an election ballot issue in the community known as Canada's prettiest town. That story coming up on CTV National News. Godric, Ontario builds itself as Canada's prettiest town and sitting on the sandy shores of Lake Hiron as it does. You can understand why. But speak to residents and there are pressing issues complicating the picture. So we sent CTV's Adrien Gobil to Godri to find out what's on people's minds during this election campaign. Since the mid 1950s, this county courthouse clock has chimed at a steady, predictable pitch. It's a tone that's reflective of the pace of life in this quaint western Ontario town. Located along the eastern shore of Lake Hiron, Godrich is home to a historic town square that's actually an octagon. Either way, it leads to the center of this community. Hi, sugar. How you guys doing? Where you'll find Steven Mary's on the square. Inside, they serve up comfort food, warm hugs, and a healthy side of small town hospitality. How would you describe the people of Godrich, Ontario? very passionate, very loving, caring, supportive. You get to talk to people. You see somebody walking down the street, you wave. With an election on order, there's plenty of passionate discussions taking place inside the diner. They're afraid they're going to lose their jobs. The mental stress of not knowing if they're going to have a job next week because they work in car manufacturing. Homelessness has also become an election issue. For a town of 8,000, there's about 130 people in the surrounding county who are on the streets. If you're seeing it in small towns, you treat it by a ratio of population. We have the same issue that some of the cities do. Expanding Godri's port for more international business is also on the election docket. These ships behind me arrive here at the port of Godrich from around the globe to pick up this community's main export. Salt from the world's largest underground salt mine. What's below Lake Hiron? Uh the same size as a CN tower. how far you go down below surface. So, it employs uh up to 600 people. From the sandy shore to the historic mine, the people here are also salt of the earth. We do only have hatock here. Just a heads up. Inside the old salty fish and chips just steps from port, the cost of living is Tama Walters ballot box issue. We need a lot more jobs. We get places opening up like stacked and Starbucks, but those are all minimum wage jobs. Like, we can't live off of minimum wage. Others we spoke with shared concerns that range from access to health care, affordable housing to rural infrastructure. As the windmills turn in this part of the country, so does another federal election cycle. Adrien Gobil, CTV News, Godri, Ontario. That is our newscast for this Friday. Thank you for watching. I'll be here with CTV National News at 11. I hope you'll join us. And for ongoing coverage of Canada's top stories, tune in to CTV News Channel. I'm Heather Bots.

It's reportedly being seen as a response to the government's crackdown on drug trafficking. Cars have been set a light in prison car parks while gunfire was heard in Tulong. Earlier, I spoke to our reporter Chris Brockman, who told us the latest on the situation. What you need to know is that the justice minister is going down to the prisons to see himself. of what happened. They're taking this very seriously for one particular reason. Last year um a drug baron was being transported between his jail and the courthouse for to see a judge and um he was freed by a gang. They used machine guns at at a point of the motorway where you pay a toll booth and they killed two prison officers and injured three others using machine guns. Um they took away the drug baron and they only captured him um earlier this year down in Romania. So in fact this is something which is very seriously. On top of that there was a parliamentary report recently which said that drug gangs had managed to infiltrate the recruitment process of prison officers. And so they actually had drug members who were prison officers themselves. And um right now as I'm talking they're actually creating a special prison for the 200 most dangerous um prisoners in France or inmates uh in the Normandy area which will be open sometime at the end of the summer. So that precisely these most dangerous prisoners are really kept under real lock and barrel and they can't speak to people in the outside world or at least everything they're doing is better monitored. Uh these attacks overnight a pretty bold move, a challenge to the government's authority it would seem. What more uh beyond that prison that you were just describing uh is the government proposing to do? Well, I think there's a widespread consensus that um the drug issue in France is the biggest consumer of illegal drugs in Europe. Um and they're really washing ashore where the prisons are Tulong Marles are huge port cities as well and drugs are washing ashore there um through the ports they're coming up from Spain from North Africa um basically they have a big drug problem here and the first thing is they've got to try and tackle that better. problem is that the people who actually the real drug barrens who run all these um these groups most of them are based abroad in North Africa in the Middle East um even Thailand um places like that um and so getting hold of them is very very difficult so what they're doing is they're kind of tackling from the bottom down I guess kind of the small dealers um but not the the big baronss who are abroad and it's really trying to get them and there's a lot of efforts I know by um there's a special task force of judges now who are trying to get all these people um extradited from these countries uh mainly in North Africa um Dubai and Thailand I said and bring them to justice over in France but until that happens it's a big issue. Chris Bachmann reporting.",2,"The video primarily reports on a series of attacks on French prisons, linking them to drug trafficking issues in France. The content does not promote or support conspiracy theories or misinformation. While it discusses serious issues like drug trafficking and the infiltration of prison staff, the information is based on reports and statements from the justice minister and other credible sources.

Agriculture Secretary Broo Rollins joins us for an exclusive discussion about where things go from here. Welcome. Good to have you this morning. Good morning, Shannon. Great to be with you. Okay, so let's start with this. We travel to Kansas this week. As we were getting ready to go talk to those farmers, this headline caught my eye. Trump's tariffs are no fun for farmers like me. Now, this author goes on to detail how all the inputs he needs for his business, all of those different materials and ingredients and supplies, they're going up. The prices on them, and he said some of the things he would have harvested this year, like some lumber, he can't do because he said the export market has quote collapsed. So, all these things adding up, uh, threatening the very, you know, existence and survival of his business. What's your message to him? Well, first of all, I think it's really important to realize that what President Trump is doing and his vision and his leadership is to completely realign the world economy, but in so doing put America first and therefore American farmers first. Shannon, for decades, decades, the way that we have been treated in this country and especially our farmers and ranchers is absolutely stunning. We have been living under a tariff regime, but it has been the regime of other countries. You know, Japan with a 700% tariff on our rice. Um, Brazil with a almost 20% tariff on our ethanol, which I I know you were in Kansas probably talking to some ethanol corn farmers. Uh, the EU takes less pork with 450 million people than does Honduras with 10 million people. I mean, it is one thing after another. And I'll be honest with you, I didn't realize how egregious it was until I took this job. I mean, I've heard President Trump talk about it for a long time. I was in his last White House as his domestic policy chief. So, I was I was somewhat aware. But once I took the job as agriculture secretary and really began to dig in, the way our a producers are treated across this world, both with high tariffs and with non-tariff barriers like unsubstantiated science claims, uh, is is just it's egregious. So the president is working to fix it. I don't know that any other political leader in our lifetime would have ever been able to do what he is doing. I know that our farmers and our ranchers realize that we're in a short hopefully short period of uncertainty, but ultimately I believe the age of prosperity for all Americans, but especially for this segment will be unprecedented. Well, and some of them are now they're hearing conversation that there may be some subsidy or help for them if the tariff situation does not go well this time around. Politico reports this. Though Trump is starting to explore another bailout, the fund he used to assist farmers the first time is now nearly depleted. Says farmers have been his most loyal constituency, but now they could be one of the groups hardest hit by his trade war. And listen, these farmers that we talked to, they're like, ""We don't want a handout. We don't like the talk of a bailout. We just want to keep our um our bargain with the American people to provide them safe, reliable food um you know, products and for around the world."" Um, but the fact is they said if they need the safety net, if it's there, they'll take it. But what if it isn't there? Well, it will be there, Shannon. But but and and that the fund is not depleted. But let me tell you this, the amount of spending by the Biden administration in using the fund that they're talking about, which is at the USDA to help in situations like this, that fund was way, I mean, just on the DEI grants and the Green New Deal, climate change. It's stunning what we have found that they were spending that money on. But I'm already talking to Congress. I had lunch with Senator Hovind and Senator Boseman, both leaders on the AD committee. We feel confident that if necessary, there will be money there to help these farmers. Now, we won't know the real results of this and hopefully Shannon, I you know, the 75 countries is a real number. I've been talking to a lot of them, too. We've already got delegations that have hit the ground from Vietnam and Japan and Thailand and other places. I mean, I do believe this will be a short-term negotiation period and then we'll move into again the economy opening up. We've already seen the numbers come in on jobs and inflation. things look really really good. But if it is necessary, we won't know that for some time. We will make sure the president has said, ""I've got the farmer's back and my job is to ensure that we effectuate that promise to our farmers."" So, let's talk about some of the federal cuts that have been going on. With respect to the USDA, uh, Reuters reports there are a couple of main programs. The emergency food assistance program and local food purchase assistance say it's going to add up to about a billion dollars in cuts. And this is food that goes to food banks and schools. Um, but it also supports the US farms that are buying uh or creating that food for you to buy. Congressman Pat Ryan, a Democrat out of New York, had this reaction to those cuts. He said, ""I had to read this five times before I believed it. The president is ripping food away from hungry children. It's absolutely disgusting. That's families going hungry. That's kids, veterans, and seniors going hungry. That's farmers going out of business."" I know that you have said there would be a continual assessment of cuts and what's going on. Can you speak to those programs? Well, first of all, that is absolutely fake news. That Democrat from New York has no idea what he's talking about. We did pull some funds back, but those were Shannon, those were COVID era funds that were specific to programs that had not been spent yet. And in fact, the states were not, they were asking for more time because they couldn't figure out how to spend the money so quickly. So, that is what we pulled back. Now, keep in mind, just two weeks ago, we released another uh community food bank program funding of $280 million to get locally sourced family farm nutritious food into our schools and into our community food programs. So, the Democrats are struggling right now for a unifying message. They think this could be it, even though it's completely false. They've made up this narrative. It is not true in reality. And never, not once, will a child go hungry in this country under any sort of USDA program or with President Trump in control and in power. Okay. You mentioned ethanol. So, I want to get to this because we talked with farmers um who primarily produce corn. They're worried if they're not able to export it or the people that they sell to won't continue buying, that they're going to have an abundance. And they say they feel like ethanol fuel fueled by corn could be helpful in the domestic market. Here is a question that we got for you from farmer Griffith Howard. Ethanol is a key component to success for our operation. How can the USDA work with the EPA and Congress in establishing a year- round sale of E15? And E15 being that blend that contains the ethanol? I know at one point you headed up a group that was against these subsidies for ethanol. What is the position of the Trump administration? Have you evolved on that? Well, Shannon, I think you're talking about a paper that came up in my hearing uh for this that was from about 15 years ago that my think tank in Texas wrote about the important importance of fossil fuels. So, I have never been on the record as being against ethanol personally. That was a long time ago that the Democrats pulled up in my hearing, but it's a really important question. Ethanol is a very, very important part of our energy independent strategy. President Trump has been unequivocal in his support for ethanol and in his support for the year- round sale for the E-15. Uh in fact, at the end of our last administration, we put that rule out. A court uh gutted that. So now we're working on it again. But as our incredible cabinet led by Secretary Chris Wright, Secretary Bergam on energy administrator Lee Zeldon along with myself, we are hyperfocused on that energy independence and ethanol and biouels is a very very important part of that. When I was in Iowa about a week and a half ago, we announced a big new grant to help build out more uh infrastructure for ethanol. We've visited almost 10 uh heartland states to this point in the last two months. I've got another four or five coming in the next two weeks. So, uh we are we are really focused on our crop, our rowcroppers, especially our corn growers, sorghum, soy, wheat, etc. But having ethanol as a key part of that strategy is really important to President Trump and the highest priority at our USDA. All right, we're just about out of time. We are out of time, but egg prices are back up again. You've had great success on that. What can people expect quickly? Well, we are focused on obviously the president securing the border and grocery prices. Eggs have been a big driver in that under Joe Biden increased by 230% in the last administration. Wholesale prices are now down almost 60%. We'll keep working on that and keep fighting for everyday Americans and especially our American farmers and ranchers here at USDA. All right, Secretary Rollins, thank you very much for your time. Hope you had a good birthday this week. Thank you, Shannon. Oh, thank you so much. Great to be with you. Hi everyone, I'm Brian Kilme.

So, subscribe right now.",3,"The video contains a discussion on tariffs and their impact on farmers, with claims that are presented with a strong bias towards supporting the previous administration's policies. While accusations of 'fake news' and criticism of opposing political figures are present, there is no clear evidence of promoting conspiracy theories or overt disinformation. The discussion does not heavily rely on fear-mongering or propose unfounded theories, but it does suggest manipulation by political opponents. This leads to a neutral assessment of the video's alignment with conspiracy theories or mis/disinformation."

MARKETS SURGED AND BOUNCING BACK INTO POSITIVE TERRITORY, BUT MOMENTS LATER THE MARKETS PLUNGED AGAIN WHEN THE WHITE HOUSE SAID THAT THE STORY WAS FAKE NEWS.

SATURN OIL AND GAS OPERATES IN ALBERTA AND SASKATCHEWAN WITH THE PRICES DOWN TO NEARLY $60 A BARREL, THE COMPANY COULD SLASH SPENDING AND DRILLING. >> IF WE SEE A SUSTAINED $60, WE WILL SEE COMPANIES PULL BACK ON CAPITAL. ONCE THEY PULL BACK ON CAPITAL, THAT IS LESS NEED FOR ENGINEERS AND GEOLOGISTS. >> Reporter: SINCE THE LATEST ROUND OF TARIFFS FROM THE U.S., NORTH AMERICAN OIL PRICES HAVE FALLEN ABOUT 15%. THE INDUSTRY IS LARGELY EXEMPT FROM ANY DIRECT TARIFFS. INSTEAD, THE GLOBAL TRADE WAR COULD LEAD TO A SLOWER ECONOMY, SLOWER CONSUMER SPENDING AND, THUS, LESS DEMAND FOR CRUDE. >> THE ONES THAT GOT HIT HARDEST BY TARIFFS WERE LARGELY CHINA AND ACROSS EAST ASIA. THAT IS ALSO THE AREA WHERE WE EXPECT TO HAVE THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTION TO GLOBAL OIL DEMAND GROWTH OVER THE COMING YEAR AND YEARS. SO THAT IS INEVITABLY GOING TO HAVE A DAMAGING EFFECT. >> Reporter: AT THE SAME TIME, SOME COUNTRIES, INCLUDING MEMBERS OF OPEC ARE PRODUCING MORE OIL. THAT TOO IS DRIVING PRICES DOWN. AS A RESULT, THE VALUE OF CANADIAN ENERGY COMPANIES IS SLIDING. >> IF YOU'RE AN INVESTOR YOU WILL WONDER ABOUT WHAT SHOULD YOU DO, SHOULD YOU STAY THE COURSE OR SHOULD YOU MAKE SOME CHANGES? SO THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING PARTS HERE THAT IS ADDING A LOT OF ANXIETY. >> Reporter: TUMBLING PRICES COULD COST SOME PROVINCES BILLIONS IN EXPECTED REVENUE FROM TAXES AND ROYALTIES. >> WE HAVE A WORST CASE SCENARIO BUDGET.

THIS TWO-YEAR DELAY WILL SAVE MANY SENIORS FROM BEING FORCED TO CRYSTALLIZE LOSSES THEY'RE EXPERIENCING ON THE STOCK MARKET TODAY. >> Mark Carney: WE WILL REDUCE THE MINIMUM AMOUNT THAT MUST BE WITHDRAWN FROM REGISTERED RETIREMENT INCOME FUNDS BY 25% FOR THE NEXT YEAR. AND THE BENEFIT HERE IS THAT SENIORS WON'T HAVE TO WITHDRAW AS MUCH OF THEIR HARD-EARNED SAVINGS WHEN MARKETS ARE VOLATILE. >> Reporter: THE LIBERALS ALSO PROMISED HELP FOR LOW-INCOME SENIORS BY BOOSTING THE GUARANTEED INCOME SUPPLEMENT. BESIDES THE MARKETS, TRUMP'S TARIFFS ON CANADA'S AUTO SECTOR ARE ALSO HITTING WORKERS HARD. MOST IMMEDIATELY THESE AT THIS STELLANTIS PLANT, NOW LAID OFF FOR AT LEAST TWO WEEKS. ONTARIO'S PREMIER IS NOW ALLOWING SOME BUSINESSES TO DEFER CERTAIN PROVINCIAL TAXES FOR SIX MONTHS. >> LET'S HOPE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP COMES TO SOME COMMON SENSE HERE. THE MARKETS ARE TUMBLING AGAIN. YOU KNOW, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS DOWN. >> Reporter: IN QUÉBEC, WHERE MANY ARE STILL SUFFERING UNDER THE WEIGHT OF STEEL AND ALUMINUM TARIFFS, YVES-FRANÇOIS BLANCHET SAID THAT THE MARKET TURMOIL COULD CONTINUE TO HELP CARNEY. >> Yves-François Blanchet: WHEN PEOPLE FEEL OR FEAR SOMETHING, THE FIRST TO PRESENT AN ANSWER MIGHT HAVE AN ADVANTAGE. >> Reporter: WITH TRUMP SHOWING NO SIGNS OF BACKING DOWN, ALL CAMPAIGNS CAN EXPECT MORE DISRUPTION AS ELECTION DAY DRAWS CLOSER. EVAN DYER, CBC NEWS, OTTAWA. >> Adrienne: ALL RIGHT, LET'S CHECK IN WITH SOME OTHER REPORTERS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, STARTING TONIGHT RIGHT HERE IN ALBERTA. >> Reporter: I'M MARINA VON STACKELBERG COVERING THE CONSERVATIVE CAMPAIGN.

AND AN IMPORTANT FOR POILIEVRE BECAUSE TONIGHT HE GOT THE ENDORSEMENT OF FORMER PRIME MINISTER STEPHEN HARPER. HAVE A LISTEN. >> FROM THE PERSON WHO HAS BEEN RIGHT ON ALL OF THE BIG ISSUES FOR A DECADE. AND A PERSON WHO HAS THE ENERGY AND, YES, THE YOUTH TO TAKE US FORWARD INTO A BETTER, STRONGER AND MORE UNITED FUTURE. >> Reporter: THERE HAVE BEEN QUITE A FEW TECHNICAL ISSUES THIS EVENING FOR US BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE PACKED INTO THAT BUILDING. IT'S MADE IT VERY HARD TO GET INFORMATION IN AND OUT. BUT HARPER DID HAVE A FEW KEY THINGS TO SAY. HE SAID THAT HE WAS IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO TALK ABOUT THE LEADER BECAUSE HE IS THE ONLY PERSON WHERE BOTH OF THE PEOPLE RUNNING WORKED FOR HIM, OF COURSE, REFERENCING MARK CARNEY AS THE FORMER BANK OF CANADA GOVERNOR WHILE STEPHEN HARPER WAS THE PRIME MINISTER. HE SAID THAT HIS CHOICE FOR PRIME MINISTER IN HIS WORDS WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT IS PIERRE POILIEVRE. HE SAYS THAT HE HAS KNOWN HIM FOR OVER A QUARTER OF A CENTURY, THAT HE WORKED HARD, HE FOUGHT AND HE LEARNED, AND THAT HE HAS THE POLITICAL EXPERIENCE AND THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC. SO, OBVIOUSLY, A VERY IMPORTANT ENDORSEMENT TONIGHT FOR PIERRE POILIEVRE JUST SOUTH OF EDMONTON HERE. >> Reporter: I'M ASHLEY BURKE COVERING THE N.D.P. WE'RE ALMOST HALFWAY THROUGH THIS CAMPAIGN AND THE N.D.P. IS VERY AWARE OF THE UPHILL BATTLE THAT IT IS FACING. THE PARTY IS STUCK, STILL TRAILING FAR BEHIND THE LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES IN THE POLLS AND IS AT RISK OF BEING SQUEEZED OUT.

NOW THAT PLAN COMES WITH A $16 BILLION PRICE TAG DURING A TIME OF ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. SINGH DEFENDED HIS STRATEGY AND SAYING THAT IF CANADA DOES SLIDE INTO A RECESSION FROM DONALD TRUMP'S TRADE WAR HE WOULDN'T CUT HIS WAY OUT OF IT, BUT HE WOULD END PRIVATE CONSULTANTS AND TAX LOOPHOLES TO FOOT THE BILL. THINGS HEAD TO B.C. NEXT WHERE IT'S SUGGESTED THAT HIS OWN SEAT COULD BE IN JEOPARDY. >> Adrienne: AT THIS POINT THE MAIN FEDERAL PARTIES HAVE LOCKED IN ALL OF THEIR CANDIDATES. THE DEADLINE TO FINALIZE NOMINATIONS PASSED TODAY. ANYONE DROPPED NOW WON'T BE REPLACED.

I MEAN, IT'S THE SHEER SIZE, THE AMOUNT OF PLANTS. >> Reporter: AND BUSINESS IS GOOD HERE. 24 GREENHOUSE COMPANY, ONE OF SEVERAL IN THE AREA, IS EXPANDING. >> THERE'S BEEN A PUSH FOR BUYING LOCAL AND BUYING CANADIAN FOR A LONG TIME, BUT CERTAINLY WHAT HAS HAPPENED RECENTLY HAS INCREASED THAT PUSH. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT IT AT THAT WAY, TRYING TO SEE IT AS A SILVER LINING KIND OF THING. >> Reporter:AS TENSIONS WITH THE U.S. LINGER, THAT MOVE TO BUY CANADIAN, HELPING TO GET MORE LOCAL PRODUCE INTO HOMES ACROSS THE PRAIRIES. SO WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR ALL OF THESE CUCUMBER? >> WELL, THE PLAN FOR ALL OF THE PRODUCT THAT IS GROWN BY BIG MARBLE FARMS, TO GET INTO THE HANDS OF ALL CANADIANS THAT WE CAN. WE WANT TO DISPLACE OUT OF COUNTRY PRODUCT, AND I WANT TO REPLACE IT WITH CANADIAN. >> Reporter: WELL, IT WAS THE RAILWAY THAT FIRST DREW PEOPLE TO MEDICINE HAT. THEN THE DISCOVERY OF NATURAL GAS FUELED A MANUFACTURING BOOM HERE. ALL THE WHILE AGRICULTURE HELPED TO SUSTAIN GROWTH. AN ECONOMY USED TO VOLATILITY AND CHANGE. >> WE HAVE A VERY RESILIENT BUSINESS COMMUNITY. I THINK THAT WHEN YOU CONSIDER THINGS LIKE FLOODS AND DROUGHTS AND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE BEEN UP AGAINST OVER THE DECADES AND WE'VE ALWAYS PERSEVERED. >> Reporter: THAT ADVERSITY IS LEADING TO ECONOMIC DIVERSITY. CASE IN POINT -- CARBON BLACK. SO WHAT THE HECK IS THIS STUFF? >> THIS IS PURE CARBON. IT'S KNOWN AS MEDIUM THERMAL CARBON BLACK AND IT'S MADE FROM THE THERMAL DECOMPOSITION OF NATURAL GAS. WE JUST EXTRACT THE CARBON OUT OF THE NATURAL GAS. THE MAJORITY OF IT GETS USED IN AUTOMOTIVE RUBBER PARTS. ANYTHING THAT IS BLACK AND MADE OF RUBBER AND ON YOUR CAR IT HAS CARBON BLACK IN IT. >> Reporter: THIS FACILITY IS JUST ONE OF TWO ON THE PLANET USING NATURAL GAS TO MAKE CARBON BLACK. CAPITALIZING ON THAT ABUNDANT AND INEXPENSIVE SOURCE OF CARBON. THESE DAYS SHIPPING AROUND THE WORLD. THIS LOAD ON THE WAY TO BRAZIL. THAT DIVERSITY OF MARKETS A PLUS DURING UNCERTAIN TIMES. >> WE REALLY APPRECIATE AND, YOU KNOW, WE WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO SUPPLYING OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S., BUT WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE THAT OVER THE LAST FOUR DECADES WE HAVE MADE A VERY PURPOSEFUL EFFORT TO DIVERSIFY OUR SALES INTO OTHER MARKETS, SO, HENCE, THE TARIFFS ARE LESS IMPACTFUL FOR US. >> Reporter: DIVERSITY BUILT INTO THE DNA OF MEDICINE HAT'S ECONOMY. FROM WIND TURBINES TO BITCOIN MINES. A WIDE VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES HAVE TAKEN OFF HERE. INCLUDING THE AEROSPACE SECTOR. MEDICINE HAT, CANADA'S DRONE CAPITAL, AN INDUSTRY THAT GREW UP AROUND THE LOCAL MILITARY BASE. >> FOR OVER TWO DECADES, EVERY ARMY DRONE FLEW WITH TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS DEVELOPED IN MEDICINE HAT. >> Reporter: TO MEASURE WEATHER AROUND THE WORLD MORE SUSTAINABLY AND NOW MADE HERE, WITH A HOPE A PUSH TO BEEF UP CANADA'S MILITARY WOULD BE A BOOST FOR THE AEROSPACE SECTOR HERE TOO. OKAY SO THIS IS A TARGET DRONE USED FOR MILITARY TRAINING BUT THE CANADIAN MILITARY IS NOT USING IT IN CANADA? >> SO EVERY YEAR CANADA DND SPENDS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON ADVANCED MILITARY TRAINING, SHOOTING AT DRONES AND THAT KIND OF THING. IN RECENT YEARS, IT HAS BEEN SOUTH OF THE BORDER, IN EUROPE. WE WANT TO BRING IT BACK TO ALBERTA, BRING IT BACK TO CANADA. >> Reporter:DRONES MADE HERE CAN BE USED FOR TARGET AT THE NEARBY BASE. DOING THAT COULD HELP CANADA'S MILITARY TO RELY LESS ON THE U.S. >> WE'RE HOPING TO SEE COMMON SENSE PREVAIL AND PEOPLE CAN SAY, THAT WE CAN DO THIS IN OUR OWN BACKYARD, GIVE JOBS TO CANADIANS, AND HELP THE TECH TO EVOLVE AND THEN CONTINUE WITH OUR EXPORTS. >> Reporter: THIS LOCAL BREWERY IS ALSO LOOKING FOR AN ASSIST FROM GOVERNMENT TO GROW.

SO OUR BEER IS ON AN 18-HOUR JOURNEY AS OPPOSED TO THE QUICK TRIP THAT IT WOULD TAKE FROM HERE. >> Reporter: A BELIEF HERE THAT CUTTING THAT RED TAPE WILL GET THIS BEER ON TAPS IN NEIGHBOURING PROVINCES QUICKER. BUSINESSES IN MEDICINE HAT CONSTANTLY SEARCHING FOR NEW MARKETS, A BLUEPRINT FOR SUCCESS MANY OTHER CANADIAN COMMUNITIES ARE SCRAMBLING TO EMULATE. AND AS THE SUN SETS ON CANADA'S TRADITIONAL TRADING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S., WELL, THERE'S A SENSE HERE THAT JUST AS THEY ALWAYS HAVE THAT PEOPLE WILL RISE ABOVE WHATEVER CHALLENGES LOOM ON THE HORIZON. (♪♪) >> Adrienne: SO, ERIN, YOU SPENT A FEW DAYS HERE IN MEDICINE HAT. WHAT'S YOUR TAKEAWAY FROM WHAT PEOPLE HERE SAY THEY ACTUALLY WANT FROM THIS ELECTION? >> Reporter: I MEAN, I THINK THAT IT'S PRETTY SAFE TO SAY THAT PEOPLE IN THESE PARTS -- THEY WANT CHANGE IN OTTAWA, RIGHT? THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE PLACES IN THE COUNTRY. THIS IS DANIELLE SMITH'S RIDING, RIGHT. THIS IS A PLACE WHERE THE CONSERVATIVE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT HAS 65% OF THE VOTE LAST TIME AROUND AND THAT'S WITH THE PEOPLE'S PARTY GETTING 10%, OKAY. SO THIS IS NOT A BATTLEGROUND RIDING, BUT YOU DO GET A SENSE IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT TO KEEP THEIR ECONOMY GOING NO MATTER WHAT CHALLENGES ARE THROWN AT THEM FROM EITHER SIDE OF THE BORDER. >> Adrienne: OKAY, THEY WANT TO SUCCEED. >> Reporter: THEY DO. >> Adrienne: ALL RIGHT, ERIN COLLINS, THANK YOU. >> Reporter: THANK YOU. >> Adrienne: OF COURSE THE MAJOR PARTIES ARE TRYING TO CAPTURE UNDECIDED VOTERS HERE SO WE ASKED PEOPLE SOME QUESTIONS WELL, ONE QUESTION IN PARTICULAR, TUCKED INSIDE OF ""THE NATIONAL ENVELOPE."" >> EVERYTHING SEEMS THAT IT'S GOING TO SHIT TO SAY THE LEAST. >> Reporter: HI, WE'RE FROM CBC ""THE NATIONAL"" AND WE HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU IN THIS ENVELOPE. >> THE NATIONAL ENVELOPE. >> DO I WIN LIKE A MILLION DOLLARS HERE? >> Reporter: I WISH.

IT'S EXPENSIVE. >> I HOPE THAT THE OIL FIELD FLOURISHES AND KEEP GOING ON THE UP. MORE JOBS. >> THE WEST SEEMS TO BE FORGOTTEN, OKAY. NOBODY CARES ABOUT THE WEST. AND, YOU KNOW, FROM MANITOBA EAST, I THINK WHAT WE NEED IS THAT WE NEED SOME ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF WHAT WE OFFER THIS COUNTRY. WHETHER IT'S AGRICULTURE OR OIL OR URANIUM OR POTASH. >> Reporter: WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR FROM THE NEXT GOVERNMENT? >> I'M LOOKING FOR POLICIES THAT ARE GOOD FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY. >> MY CHILD'S FUTURE, THAT'S WHAT I WORRY ABOUT THE MOST. >> EVERYBODY WORRIES ABOUT THEIR KIDS, RIGHT? >> WHAT DO I WORRY ABOUT?

SO I'M GOOD. (♪♪) >> Adrienne: THERE'S MORE TO COME TONIGHT FROM BEAUTIFUL MEDICINE HAT. INCLUDING WHAT THE POLLS SAY ABOUT THE RACE HERE IN ALBERTA AND HOW IT COULD PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE RESULTS. >> NORMALLY THERE'S NOT A LOT OF ATTENTION PAID TO ALBERTA, BUT IN THIS ELECTION THOSE HANDFUL OF SEATS -- WHO KNOWS, THEY COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE. >> Adrienne: MORE WITH MY CONVERSATION WITH POLLSTER JANET BROWN AFTER THE BREAK. (( (♪♪) >> Adrienne: WE'RE IN MEDICINE HAT, ALBERTA, AND WE'RE LOOKING AT OUR CBC NEWS POLL TRACKER, AN AGGREGATE OF MAJOR NATIONAL POLLS. SO HERE IS TODAY'S SNAPSHOT. AT THE TOP, THE LIBERALS AT 43.9%, THAT IS UP 1.9% FROM LAST WEEK. THE CONSERVATIVES, AT 37.2%, THAT IS DOWN .3% OF A PERCENT. NOW HERE IN ALBERTA, THE CONSERVATIVES ARE AT 55.9%, AND THE LIBERALS ARE AT 30.3%. IN TERMS OF THIS PROVINCE'S 37 SEATS WITH THESE POLLING NUMBERS THE CONSERVATIVES COULD WIN BETWEEN 25 AND 29 SEATS, AND THE LIBERALS BETWEEN 7 AND 11. I SPOKE WITH ALBERTA'S POLLSTER JANET BROWN ABOUT THIS PROVINCE'S ELECTORAL MATH AND THE CONCERNS OF SOME HERE ABOUT CANADA'S RESPONSE TO THE TRADE WAR. WHEN WE HAVE HEARD PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH TALK ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF A UNITY CRISIS AND PRESTON MANNING SAYING EFFECTIVELY THE SAME THING, WHAT IS THAT CONVERSATION? WHAT ARE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, THIS IDEA OF WESTERN SEPARATISM -- I MEAN, IT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A VERY LONG TIME. AND IT SORT OF EBBS AND FLOWS BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A SMALL GROUP OF ALBERTANS TALKING ABOUT IT. AND SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOISIER THAN NOT. WHAT YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT NONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WOULD VOTE N.D.P. IN AN ELECTION BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE IN THE U.P.C. CAMP. THEY STILL DON'T REPRESENT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN THE U.C.P., BUT THEY ARE THIS SIZEABLE MINORITY THAT DANIELLE SMITH KEEPS HER EYE ON. AND SHE TALKS TO THEM A LOT IN HER MESSAGING. >> Adrienne: WHAT IS IT THAT SHE'S SUGGESTING THAT WILL HAPPEN? >> WELL, DANIELLE SMITH GOT ELECTED ON THIS MANDATE OF SAYING THAT WE HAVE TO FIGHT OTTAWA, WE HAVE TO FIGHT HARDER FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR RESOURCES HERE IN ALBERTA. SO WHAT SHE'S SAYING TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THAT IF WE DON'T SEE MOVEMENT ON THOSE THINGS WE'RE GOING TO START AGITATING AGAIN AND WE'LL MAKE THIS A NATIONAL UNITY ISSUE. QUESTION WANT ALBERTA'S ECONOMIC INTERESTS TO BE BETTER RECOGNISED BY THE REST OF CANADA. >> Adrienne: HOW MUCH TRACTION DO YOU SEE THAT GETTING? >> WELL, AS I SAID, THERE IS THIS SMALL GROUP OF ALBERTANS WHO ALWAYS HAVE HAD THIS SORT OF WESTERN INDEPENDENCE SENTIMENT THAT THEY SHARE. I'M NOT SURE THAT GROUP IS GROWING BUT THAT GROUP IS DEFINITELY GETTING NOISIER. >> Adrienne: WHERE DOES THIS PROVINCE FIT WITHIN THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION IN THIS MOMENT THOUGH? >> CANADA'S LARGEST INDUSTRY, OIL AND GAS, IS CENTRED HERE IN ALBERTA. AND WHEN YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A TRADE DISPUTE, WHEN CANADA'S ECONOMY IS THREATENED THE WAY THAT IT IS, THE HEALTH OF THE STRONGEST INDUSTRY IN THE COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE REALLY BE IMPORTANT -- NOT JUST TO ALBERTANS, BUT TO EVERYBODY. AND ALBERTA IS GOING TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IS PAYING ATTENTION TO THEIR INTERESTS, AND NOT TRYING TO STYMIE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY. >> Adrienne: IS THERE A PERCEPTION THAT CANADIANS STILL DON'T GET ALBERTA AND BY ""CANADIANS"" I MEAN PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIVE IN ALBERTA? >> ABSOLUTELY. THERE IS THIS VERY STRONG SENSE THAT OTHER CANADIANS DON'T APPRECIATE ALBERTA, DON'T UNDERSTAND OUR MOST IMPORTANT INDUSTRIES. YOU KNOW, YOU TALK TO PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF ALBERTA AND THEY'RE SHOCKED TO KNOW THAT OIL AND GAS IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST INDUSTRY IN THE COUNTRY. THEY'RE SURPRISED TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH MORE ALBERTA CONTRIBUTES IN TRANSFER PAYMENTS THAN THEY RECEIVE BACK IN GOVERNMENT SERVICES. I THINK THAT HERE IN ALBERTA WE'RE VERY WELL VERSED ON THE ECONOMICS OF OIL AND GAS AND ALBERTA'S ECONOMIC POSITION IN THE REST OF CANADA. BUT WE DON'T FEEL THAT THE REST OF CANADA UNDERSTANDS THAT. >> Adrienne: SO I APPRECIATE THAT -- THAT FEDERALLY ALBERTA DOESN'T NECESSARILY MAKE OR BREAK AN ELECTION. BUT THERE IS -- THERE IS SORT OF SOME ALCHEMY THIS TIME THAT MIGHT MAKE MORE SEATS IN THIS PROVINCE IN PLAY, RIGHT? >> WELL, USUALLY THE COUNTRY DOESN'T INVEST A LOT OF ATTENTION INTO ALBERTA DURING A FEDERAL ELECTION BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY A HANDFUL OF SEATS THAT ARE UP FOR GRABS. BUT NOW WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S UNCERTAIN, WHETHER THIS IS GOING TO BE A MAJORITY GOVERNMENT OR A MINORITY GOVERNMENT, THEN SUDDENLY SIX OR EIGHT SEATS MAKES A DIFFERENCE. SO, YEAH, NORMALLY THERE'S NOT A LOT OF ATTENTION PAID TO ALBERTA, BUT IN THIS ELECTION THOSE HANDFUL OF SEATS -- WHO KNOWS, THEY COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE. >> Adrienne: AND THE ONES THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE IN THE URBAN CENTRES SO CALGARY AND EDMONTON IN PARTICULAR? >> RIGHT. I'M THINKING ABOUT A RIDING LIKE CALGARY CONFEDERATION WHICH IS IN DOWNTOWN CALGARY. IF THE LIBERALS ARE GOING TO WIN A MAJORITY, THEY ALMOST HAVE TO WIN THAT SEAT TO GET TO A MAJORITY. IT'S LIKE THAT IS ALMOST LIKE A BELLWETHER RIDING SO WHETHER THE LIBERALS ARE GOING TO WIN A MAJORITY OR A MINORITY. >> Adrienne: SO FOUR SEATS IN CALGARY AND FOUR IN EDMONTON. MIGHT TELL YOU WHAT KIND OF STORY? >> WELL, IT MIGHT TELL YOU THE STORY OF WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO BE A MAJORITY OR A MINORITY. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THE LIBERALS GETTING ENOUGH SEATS TO GET TO A MAJORITY WITHOUT WINNING AT LEAST FOUR OR FIVE SEATS IN ALBERTA. >> Adrienne: LET'S TALK ABOUT VOTE SPLITTING FOR A SECOND. WHERE DO YOU SEE IT LIKELY TO HAPPEN? AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES DO YOU SEE IT STARTING TO HAPPEN? >> SO THE TWO RIDINGS THAT I THINK THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE IS EDMONTON-GRIJSE BOND AND EDMONTON-STRATHCONA. THEY BOTH CURRENTLY HAVE AN N.D.P. M. RUNNING AGAIN, AND INCUMBENTS POPULAR. THE N.D.P. WILL REALLY WANT TO RUN IN THOSE ELECTIONS. BUT I COULD SEE PROGRESSIVES IN EDMONTON GETTING WORRIED AND SWITCHING FROM THE N.D.P. TO LIBERAL. IF YOU HAVE TOO MUCH OF VOTE SPLITTING THEN MAYBE THE CONSERVATIVES CAN COME UP THE MIDDLE AND WIN THOSE SEATS. SO, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY THREE-WAY SEATS THERE ARE IN CANADA. BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOT TOO MANY IN ALBERTA, BUT THOSE TWO ARE SOLID THREE-WAY VOTES AND THAT MAKES A SEAT LIKE THAT VERY UNPREDICTABLE. >> Adrienne: OKAY. A LOT TO WATCH FOR. WE'RE NOT DONE YET HERE IN MEDICINE HAT. TOMORROW NIGHT WE'LL HEAR FROM VOTERS WHO LIVE HERE, PART OF OUR NATIONAL CONVERSATION IN THE LEAD-UP TO THE APRIL 28TH ELECTION. HERE'S A PREVIEW OF A BIT OF A CHAT WHEN THEY STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE LEADERS. >> I BELIEVE THAT PIERRE IS WAY MORE IN TOUCH. HE GREW UP A NORMAL KID IN CALGARY AND I WANT SOMEBODY IN THERE THAT IS ABLE TO RELATE AND THAT CAN THINK BACK, HEY, WHAT WAS IT LIKE GROWING UP, AND WHAT DOES CANADA NEED? AND MARK CARNEY IS NOT THAT. >> WE NEED TO TIGHTEN OUR BELTS, WHEN BUSINESSES ARE THRIVING WE'LL ALL DO WELL. >> I SEE NOTHING ABOUT HIM THAT IS RELATABLE. HE MAY HAVE HAD HUMBLE BEGINNINGS BUT THAT MAN IS WEALTHY AND HE HAS SPENT HIS ENTIRE CAREER BEING A POLITICIAN. I THINK THAT PIER HAS SPENT A BETTER SHORT OF A DECADE SHOUTING INTO THE VOID ABOUT HOW CANADA IS BROKEN AND EVERYTHING IS SO WRONG HERE. AND NOW I HEAR HIM CHANGE HIS TUNE. >> WE ARE -- WE ARE BROKEN RIGHT NOW. >> OBVIOUSLY, WE HAVE BEEN -- >> WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING BANKRUPT AND WE ARE BROKEN AND WE'RE ALL FEELING IT. >> YEAH. >> IT'S SHAMEFUL. THAT IS OUR REALITY RIGHT NOW. >> Adrienne:OKAY, THAT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A MUCH LARGER CONVERSATION THAT YOU WILL HEAR TOMORROW NIGHT ON ""THE NATIONAL."" BUT COMING UP TONIGHT, AT 97 YEARS OLD, A TORTOISE CALLED MOMMY IS A FIRST-TIME MOM. >> A CRITICALLY ENDANGERED SPECIES SO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM ARE VALUABLE. >> Adrienne: MEET THE TWO NEARL. BUT DO THE ECONOMICS MAKE SENSE? LISTEN WHEREVER YOU GET YOUR PODCAST OR ON YouTube. >> Adrienne: NOPE, THESE ARE NOT THE TEENAGED MUTAN TURTLES. THEY ARE TORTOISES, WESTERN SANTA CRUZ GALAPAGOS TORTOISE TO BE SPECIFIC AND THEY ARE THE NEWEST ADDITION TO THE PHILADELPHIA ZOO. SO WHY DOES THIS MATTER? WELL, IT MATTERS BECAUSE THEIR FATHER IS 96 YEARS OLD AND THEIR MOTHER IS BELIEVED TO BE 97. MAKING HER THE OLDEST KNOWN FIRST-TIME MOM OF HER SPECIES, WHICH IS LISTED AS CRITICALLY ENDANGERED. SO THESE REMARKABLE HATCHLINGS MAKE OUR ""MOMENT."" (♪♪) >> THESE FOUR HATCHLINGS, THEY ARE THE CUTEST THAT YOU WILL EVER SEE. MOMMY FIRST CAME TO THE ZOO IN 1932. SHE IS ESTIMATED TO BE 97 YEARS OLD, WEIGHING IN AT 284 POUNDS. AND ABRAZZO IS ABOVE HIS AGE AND HE'S ESTIMATED TO BE 96 YEARS OLD. HE WEIGHS IN AT ROUGHLY 500 POUNDS. HE'S HUGE. INITIALLY THE TWO WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL, BUT THEN A FEW MONTHS LATER WE HAD FOUR HATCHLINGS. SO NOT ONLY IS OUR MOMMY NAMED MOMMY THAT IS NOW HER OCCUPATION. AT 97 YEARS OLD, SHE'S A FIRST-TIME MOM IN THE WESTERN SANTA CRUZ GALAPAGOS TORTOISE. THEY ARE CRITICALLY ENDANGERED SPECIES, SO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM IS VALUABLE. AND OUR GOAL IS THAT THESE FOUR HATCHLINGS WILL BE A THRIVING POPULATION OF WESTERN SANTA CRUZ GALAPAGOS TORTOISES. AND I LOVE THAT. >> Adrienne: SO THIS IS AMAZING. AND IN THE CATEGORY IF YOU LEARN SOMETHING NEW EVERY DAY, AT LEAST I DO -- I DID NOT REALIZE THAT THE SEX OF THE HATCHLING IS DETERMINED AT THE TEMPERATURE AT WHICH ITS INCUBATED. SO IF IT'S LESS THAN 82.4º, IT'S A BOY. SO IF IT'S COOL, IT IS A DUDE. >> THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US AND YOU CAN WATCH ANYWHERE, ANY TIME ON THE FREE CBC NEWS APP AND SUBSCRIBE TO ""THE NATIONAL'S"" YouTube CHANNEL. >>> I'M ADRIENNE ARSENAULT WITH",1,The video transcript from CBC News: The National does not support conspiracy theories or mis/disinformation.

HiiIsR4GS-430lq6vXXhdSS-bYA,&#39;100 percent&#39; chance of tariff deal with EU says Trump | DW News,"Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni has met with US Vice President JD Vance in Italy, just a day after meeting with President ...",DW News,2025-04-18T15:30:02Z,"{'default': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ZvnXQ3mn8E/default.jpg', 'width': 120, 'height': 90}, 'medium': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ZvnXQ3mn8E/mqdefault.jpg', 'width': 320, 'height': 180}, 'high': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ZvnXQ3mn8E/hqdefault.jpg', 'width': 480, 'height': 360}}",UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg,3ZvnXQ3mn8E,900,156783,en,3ZvnXQ3mn8E,"Well, Maloney's talks with Vance come on the heels of her visit to Washington, DC. There, she met with Donald Trump, who said that he believed a trade deal with the EU would be reached soon. Now, Maloney has assumed something of a mediating role between the European Union and the United States since Trump took office, especially in the wake of his new tariffs. A 10% tariff on EU imports is currently in place. Georgia Maloney arrived in Washington in her official role as Italian prime minister. However, her unofficial role was the main focus back in Europe. Maloney has cast herself as a bridge between Brussels and Washington since Trump moved back into the White House in January. The Italian prime minister is the only European leader to attend Donald Trump's inauguration. And now she is the first to meet the president face to face since he announced then suspended 20% tariffs on European exports. I want to hear what you said. Inside the Oval Office, the president said he would 100% reach a tariffs deal with the European Union before heaping praise on his Italian counterpart. It's an honor to have the prime minister of Italy with us, Prime Minister Maloney, who's uh doing a fantastic job. I would say that she has taken Europe by storm and highly respected. Everybody loves her and respects her and I can't say that about many people and uh she's become a friend. Maloney highlighted her political common ground with the US president, even paraphrasing his best known slogan. I think even if we have some problems, okay, uh between the two shores of the Atlantic, it is the time that we try to sit down and and find solutions. So, I want to thank President Trump. Uh the goal for me is to make the West great again. Okay? And I think we can do it together. We can a successful visit for Georgia Maloney, not just in Washington, but also back in Brussels. Europe hopes that she can traverse the increasingly choppy waters currently dividing the two sides of the Atlantic. So, this is a really interesting story here. Let's see if we can bring in Antonio Zati to speak about it a bit more. He is a political scientist at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan. So, welcome. First of all, we have Donald Trump saying he's now 100% sure of an EU tariff deal. Does that mean that Maloney's visit was a success? Well, it's quite first of all, thank you for having me here. uh it's quite difficult to say uh if that is actually the case or not because due to the uh highly unpredictable political and economic landscape which was created by the Trump administration itself, high praises and shows of admiration only count relatively. Yes, sure. uh Italy and in particular Georgia Maloney um may play a role in creating more less at least less tense relations with uh with the US. Um maybe in view of creating a coalition visa v the the rising role of China in the emerging new international political and economic order. Uh on the other hand though uh there's nothing that allows us to rule out the possibility that the US administration will keep in play up differences in driving wedges uh between member states possibly through these special relationships with uh governments that are perceived as being like-minded like Italies. And in doing so, of course, there's also this trend that has already emerged throughout these few these early months of the US administration. Uh the goal of undermining to a certain extent the European Union's governance and uh legitimacy at large. Yeah. At least for now though, as you say, George Maloney does seem to be getting a lot of attention from the Trump administration. I mean, she's visited the White House and just a day later she's receiving Vice President Vance in Rome. What do you think are Washington's interests with her specifically here? Well, uh, one has to consider that, uh, Italy's, um, relative weight within the European Union has increased since Brexit because, uh, Italy has more of an opportunity to play up with the other big shots, uh, within the union. Um and again uh I I think the US administration sees in Melanie uh sort of a um European branch of the kind of uh new ideology um anti-globalization uh or at least aimed at reshuffling the international order that they have been pushing for. Uh on the other hand uh these success these increased credit both domestically and internationally that uh the government led by Melani has acquired uh may come at the expense of the internal stability of the coalition that is currently ruling in Italy. Um it is telling that uh the Mateo Salvini the the leader of a junior partner of the ruling coalition has been even more stripped off of the role that he was hoping to play as a special connection with the US administration. Um these of course uh may create some problem in the if not the short term uh over the over the le the rest of the legislature in Italy. Um so the success does not come completely free of of possible dangers. On the other hand, uh yes, I I guess that the US administration does hope to uh get some help from um from Georgia Maloney and from the Italian government in general uh to come up with a trade agreement. Uh on the other hand uh again Georgia Maloney is quite prone to uh to be also used as um a spanner to throw into uh the the workings of the European Union. So I I would say that as far as it as we can say uh there are it is there are both promising perspectives here uh but also uh possible dangers of the Italian government to be used again as a as a weapon against just just very briefly before I let you go let's pick up on that last point that there were fears that Maloney could potentially turn her back on European partners especially on things like maybe softening her stance on the war in UK Ukraine, but it does seem like she's managed to please both the EU and Trump uh so far. What do you make of this balancing act? Well, this is one of the credit that has to be acknowledged in favor of Georgia Maloney because actually uh in Italy traditionally um the the pursuit of um let's say more Atlantis goals and um the the aim of participating into the European integration process has quite rarely been conceived as being at odds with each other. They were they have been only um rarely um regarded as being alternatives. On the other hand, um it has to it also has to be considered that uh Melon's uh political platform um especially uh the core of her supporters uh is definitely does not have much love for either the European Union and in particular uh the current president of the European Commission. And yet Melani has been able to tow the line as far as Ukraine was concerned. It's so quite significant that uh the only difficult questions during uh the the meeting with the press was coming from an Italian journalist. The only question that was asked in Italian. Uh but Melanie did not shy away from her role as the representative of the European Union. So that is quite promising. But again in Italy the center right coalition is characterized by a high volat volatility of voters. So voters uh at elections tend to um to to opt for the for the party within the coalition which has the highest uh possibilities of um getting the the biggest share of the votes. So in that sense um in doing that Melan is also trying to keep together an electorate that is made up both of uh long-term believers but also of people who only voted for her for the time being. Well, thank you so much for joining us today on DW News with your insights. We've been speaking with political scientist Antonio Zotti in Milan. Thank you. And for more on this, I'm going to talk to Ricardo Alcaro. He is an analyst at the Italian think tank, the Institute for International Affairs. He's joining me from Rome. Welcome to DW, Ricardo. Um, Georgia Maloney has styled herself as a bridge between the European Union and the Trump administration. Did she make any ground uh with this visit? Does this now create more room for a trade deal between the EU and the US? Good morning. Uh I think it it does although we we shouldn't be excessively hopeful given the unpredictability and general hostility towards the EU uh shown espouse by President Trump over the years. But look, Meloney had three goals when uh she she uh made her uh trip to Washington. She wanted to defend Italian commercial interests very much hit by US tariffs. She wanted to reiterate Italy's proximity to the United States and her own closeness to uh this specific Trump administration, right-wing administration. And she wanted to do all this without creating fracture inside the EU. And to the extent that was possible, to the extent that reconciling these goals was possible, she uh did score some important results, Trump has openly expressed the the the uh certainty that there will be a deal with Europe. So this is as far as I can recall the first time he has mentioned a deal on tariffs with Europe implicitly recognizing that it will have to be with Europe. So as a as a as a unitary block and he has also agreed to come over to to Italy in the ne in the the next future. Uh and on that occasion Meloney would like to turn that into a you know multilateral uh uh dialogue with other European leaders especially European Commission president from the line but I'm not entirely sure that would be possible. Right. And on Ukraine, you've just had the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio leaving Europe, suggesting that Washington could stop its efforts to negotiate peace in Ukraine. We know that there are differing views within the European Union about the war in Ukraine. But would George Maloney be appealing to Donald Trump to stay in the game, so to say? Yeah. Yeah, she will be doing she will be doing that. I mean, uh, Melon's line is never to criticize Trump. always insist on the advantages of transatlantic cooperation even when uh Trump is pursuing a completely different policy line actually creating divisions uh across the Atlantic but she will keep insisting on doing something together and because her belief is that uh the West is a hierarchical uh coalition of of nations centered on the United States and that if the United States shifts position, it is the responsibility and the duty of European countries to adapt, not the other way around. Ricardo, as you were saying earlier, Trump and Maloney have a lot in common. Uh they get along really well. We could see that in their interactions at the White House. Could their relationship have an influence on EU US policy? Leaders of the world and I'm very proud to be with Look, it might it might. Uh there are however I mean there are ideological affinities between the two. Okay. Melon sees the west as a community of nations of European descent linked to one another by history, tradition and religion much more than they are by the universalistic values of liberal democracy. And this is in line with the ideology espoused by the Trump administration. However, while Maloney sees the transatlantic relationship as a strategic alliance, Trump isn't really sure about that, doesn't believe in long-term alliances, and really doesn't like the Europeans. So the the the issue here is whether Melon can find some common ground uh in terms of pushing for uh uh pushing inside the EU for um meeting the United States administration halfway on issues like environmental regulations or leniency toward on in the investigations that the European Commission has opened against big tech and stuff like that. But there are there will be limits to what Meloney can do. But I mean for as much as she I mean to the extent she can do something she will always be happy with that because I mean dealing with Trump is quite difficult even for her. Well thanks for that Ricardo Alcaro from the Institute for International Affairs joining us from Rome. Thank you. Thank you for having me.",2,"The video transcript primarily discusses political dynamics and trade negotiations between Italy, the EU, and the US under the leadership of Georgia Maloney and Donald Trump. While it includes some political commentary and speculation about strategic alliances, it does not strongly promote conspiracy theories or misinformation. There is no evident use of language suggesting secrecy or manipulation, nor are there unfounded claims that contradict widely accepted facts.

They had a huge concrete patio that needed to be poured, so eventually we decided to go for it, even though they were calling for a slight chance of thunderstorms. Now, this was exposed aggregate concrete that you have to power wash once the concrete sets up. So around 5:00 that afternoon, they were finishing up power washing and I was getting ready to head home when I noticed the sky was getting dark off in the distance. So I said, ""Whatever you do, don't stay out here and get struck by lightning."" About 45 minutes later, I was home taking a shower and my wife came in the bathroom and handed me the phone. It was my mason. He said, ""Remember the last thing you said to me?"" Well, I just got struck by lightning. Luckily, he was wearing rubber boots. He said there was a huge bang. Everything went white and his helper saw fire roll up his boots. They dropped everything and ran to the truck. Thankfully, no one was hurt, but he did say his feet tingled for the rest of the day.",1,The video transcript contains a personal anecdote about a construction worker being struck by lightning.

Well, boy, have you come to the right guy in the right channel and the right [Music] day? This is basically not even cooking. This is just compiling and throwing a bunch of junk into the oven. So simple. What's involved, Tim? Well, there's chicken involved and everybody loves chicken. There's sausage involved. There's potatoes. There's other vegetables and everything just goes into one big bowl. Could be on a sheet pan if you want. Throw a little marinade together. You go like this and then into the oven. And an hour later, look out, son. You are eating large and delicious. So, let's crack on. Start with a little bowl and in it we'll put some olive oil. This is sort of a Greekish in nature, so olive oil would be the thing to do. juice of a good lemon. And that is a good lemon, man. And if seeds go in, ignore it. You're not going to need to worry about Now we have oregano because Greek food loves oregano. It also loves a little heat in the form of smoked paprika. Some red chili flake. It can handle it. And some thyme. Good pinch of our friend salt and pepper. And this we can mix. Right. Let me chop up some garlic next. Like this. Commencing garlic chop. [Music] And it's fine like this. We're just going to scatter it over after. So, back in our bowl. One quick wipe and we continue. All right, let's look at what we're dealing with. Chicken thighs. Listen, if you give them a little bit of this business, the flavors will soak in a little bit and they'll actually look kind of cool when it's time to serve them. And bone in, by the way, more flavor. I have these onions that we will want cut down a bit. The potatoes are Oh, the bigger ones we could cut in half. If you had baby white ones, that would be fine. Ah, hell. Let's cut them all in half. They look prettier. And at the last minute, I grabbed these peppers that I used for a shoot yesterday. We can give these guys a little rough and throw them in because look how great the color is. Superb. And our sausages. We'll just do this. Some of the juice will leak out while they're cooking. These are chicken sausages, by the way. You could use anything you want. Beautiful part of this dish is that everything's going to cook together in this giant, beautiful dish. So, let's assemble, shall we? Chicken. It's all going to get tossed around in a second. The sausages. Just like that. The potatoes and onions. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. The peppers. And now we can glove up so we can get the marinade mixed in. It's not easy when your hand is a little wet. Oh my god. This is insane. I'd be like the worst surgeon. Doctor, the patient needs you. I'll be there in an hour. I can't get my gloves on. Were your hands wet, doctor? Well, a little, but nothing awful. Okay, remember this little toss. It smells fantastic. It really does. And we do this. Couple things to add. Remember our garlic? Yes. Just like that. Scattered on top. And some fennel seeds. That will give a little beautiful hint of licorice. And that's it. So, make it look pretty. Sort of set them so you see a little bit of everything in here. And when you're set, say goodbye. Whisk the whole thing off to a 400°ree oven. And we'll be back when it's ready. And that will be in about an hour. And at the end of about an hour and 8 minutes. Look at that gorgeousness. All right. I got two little things to finish this. The first will be a nice drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Just like that. And then a little parsley. Like that. Look it. Wow. You can't cook. You can cook. Just follow my stupid directions and you'll end up with this. You don't have one of these big beautiful clay pot things from Ecuador. I don't know where it came from actually from Amazon. Use a sheet pan. Use a giant cast iron pan. Use whatever you've got. Stainless steel pan. There's nothing I don't like about this. It was easy to put together. It looks beautiful. It smells amazing. It all cooks at the same time. Potatoes, perfect. Chicken, gorgeous. Little crispy on top. The sausages, unbelievable. And look at the vegetables in here. the onions, all this crispy goodness. Let's get a bite, shall we? Let's not play games anymore. Let's just get a bite of something. I'm just going to have a bite of a sausage and get it in some of that delicious sauce underneath with a little red pepper. Look at that. Imagine taking this to somebody's house. You just roll in with this thing. Better still, roll in with it uncooked. Take over their oven for an hour. No harm. They'll be happy. Oh, boy. The sausage was chicken. Could be lamb. Could be anything. I just got some of the finel seed in that. It's fantastic. Okay, the boys and I are now going to consume this. I want you to make it. You can do Look at me. Look at me in the eyes.

They try to hold me down, tear me apart, but with baby. [Music] Hi guys, good morning. Welcome back to my channel. This weekend is Ashley Dom's birthday weekend. I'm so excited to bring you guys along with me because we have so many fun things planned. I think it's been a while since I've been back in this kitchen to cook together. So, for lunch today, I'm thinking of recreating my shrimp patties and turning them to chicken patties instead. It takes less than 20 minutes to put together. So, I'm going to quickly enjoy my hoicha and let's get cooking. Hi friends. Welcome back to the vlog. I'm so happy to be cooking and eating with you again in my kitchen. Lately, I've been obsessed with sneaking in veggies into my recipes to increase my fiber intake. And let me tell you, these chicken veggie patties are my new go-to. I made them once and then again the very next week because they are that good. They're healthy, delicious, and the perfect little protein packed patties to keep in the fridge or quick meals for meal prep. All you have to do is chop up all your favorite veggies, then blend up some ground chicken in the food processor. I like to use chicken thighs to make them extra juicy and tender. In a big bowl, mix together chopped chicken, green onion, carrots, jalapeno, sweet corn, Thai red chili, one egg, vegetarian oyster sauce, soy sauce, black pepper, and a little bit of cornstarch to hold it all together. Give everything a good mix until well combined. If you don't like things spicy, you can also skip the jalapeno and the tide red chili. And then pan fry the patties on medium heat for around 4 to 5 minutes on each side or until they're golden and crispy on the outside and super juicy on the inside. These actually reheat so well, too. So, just pop them in the air fryer or microwave, and they're still super delicious the next day. You can totally enjoy them on their own, but I love dipping them in this super easy and spicy tang sauce. Just mix soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, jalapeno, ty chili, and sesame seeds. It is simple, but packed with so much flavor. And just like that, lunch is served. This looks so, so, so good. Not going to lie, I already had a little piece already and the chicken was so so juicy. I can't wait to dig in. Kaid, let me get a little bit of that [Music] sauce. M. Mhm. The chicken is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. And the corn as well as the carrots add a really nice crunch and sweetness. It's so so yummy. M. Honestly, I think kids would really like this, too. You can just take out the red chili as well as the jalapeno and swap it with red peppers instead. And for the sauce, I think a sweet and sour sauce. That would be so good. Anyways, currently I am binge watching The Potato Lab. I've heard so many good things about it. It's really, really funny so far, and I can't wait to continue. So, I'm going to enjoy lunch, watch my Kdrama, and I'll see you guys in a bit. Fore! Foreign! Foreign! [Music] Hi guys. So, I just got back and I'm craving something sweet. So, I figured I would share with you guys one of my favorite desserts lately. It's high in protein and high in fiber. Plus, you don't actually have to bake it and takes less than 10 minutes to put together. And it's so, so yummy. So, let's go make it together. Okay, I can't be the only one who has been tricked by these healthy desserts that you see online, but when you make them, they end up tasting not very good, but I promise this raspberry yogurt bowl is actually so yummy and 100% worth trying. It's tangy, it's sweet, it's chocolate, and it's just the perfect combo. Start by mixing together some smashed raspberries, chia seed, thick Greek yogurt, and a drizzle of honey until everything is nice and creamy. Next, melt some dark chocolate with a little bit of coconut oil and drizzle that magic all over the yogurt mixture. Pop into the freezer for around 15 minutes or until the chocolate has set. Finish off with a pinch of flaky sea salt. And that's it. You got a healthy dessert that's not only super easy, but it's actually delicious. Ooh, I'm so so excited to dig in. Let me mix it all up and get some raspberries. The perfect bite. M m. Raspberry plus chocolate and yogurt is the best best combo. Also, the chia seed soaked up some of the yogurt, so it's now nice and plumped. M. This is so good. The weather is actually so nice today. So, I think I'm going to go for a little walk before dinner, but I'm going to quickly enjoy my sweet treat and I'll see you guys in a bit. [Music] I don't know if it's just me, but the moment spring hits and I see a little bit of sun, I instantly start craving peppers, like all of the colors. And I recently read that eating the rainbow everyday can actually boost your mood because you're feeding your body so many good things. So today, let's make a yummy shrimp bowl that's packed with flavor and color. Every time I crack open a new tub of Greek yogurt, I always make a big batch of this herb dipping sauce that seriously tastes amazing with everything. I blend together Greek yogurt, parsley, mint, teragon, dill, chives, jalapeno, garlic, avocado, lemon zest, and the juice, olive oil, and salt and pepper. It is herby. It's garicky. It's a little bit spicy. Super refreshing and so so [Music] creamy. For the prawns, I season all spice, turmeric, red chili flakes, paprika, salt and pepper, and olive oil. It's very simple, but very, very flavorful. I then pan fry them for around 7 to 8 minutes or until they're golden, juicy, and perfectly cooked. Garnish with some chives and lemon zest and then set them [Music] aside. In the same pan, I added red onion and saute for 2 to three minutes until soft and fragrant. I then toss in my peppers and let them cook for another 3 to 4 minutes as they soak up all that delicious flavors from the prawns. Now, all we have to do is assemble. This meal was so yummy that I made again the next week. If you're looking for a recipe that's healthy, filling, and packed with lots of flavor, this one is for you. Now dinner is served. Taste test time. This looks so good. Wo. This sauce is so good. M. I feel like with chips and veggie later when we're watching the show. Mhm. Dama approved. Yeah man. And the sauce is really good. Bang. M. Cheers. [Music] [Music] [Music] Let's go get a haircut together. [Music] Hi guys, I just got back from my haircut. I think she did such an amazing job. My hair feels so much lighter. I think in total we cut off 3 in, but we added in some layers at the bottom as well as some face framing layers and I really, really like it. I'll include her information down below and I think I'll be going again. Highly recommend. Anyways, I am starving right now. So, I'm just going to make a really, really, really quick lunch since we're actually having my brother-in-law come over for dinner and I'm making a huge feast. So, let's get cooking. [Music] This is my type of pasta salad. And I'm not even kidding. This took 7 minutes. Kaido, it's so refreshing. 10 out of 10. highly recommend giving this combo a try. Anyways, for dinner today, my brother-in-law is actually coming over because him and Dom's birthday are super super close. So, we're just going to do a huge family celebration. I'm cooking oxtail soup as well as beef short ribs. So, they both are pretty easy, but just takes a long time to prep. So, I'm going to get that prepping. And while I'm waiting for that, I'm also really really craving a lemon blueberry loaf. I think my mom's going to come over a little bit earlier to help me with the prepping as well as making desserts because she's so so good at baking. But anyways, I'm going to enjoy my lunch, continue watching Potato Lab, and I'll see you guys in a bit. Here is my hot take. If you're hosting dinner and want to impress your guests without spending hours in the kitchen, stews and soups should be your best friend. Seriously, this black pepper beef short ribs and oxtail soup both took less than 30 minutes to prep, and I just let them simmer away while I cleaned up, set the table, and got ready. By the time the dinner rolled around, everything was done in my kitchen smelled amazing. Let's start by making the black pepper beef short ribs. First, coat the short ribs with a generous amount of salt and pepper. Then, pan fry for around 3 minutes on each side. Browning the beef helps build that deep, rich flavor that we want in the stew. So, don't skip this step. [Music] Once it's nice and golden, remove and set aside. In the same pan, add in sliced onion and saute for 4 to 5 minutes until soft and fragrant. Add the short ribs back in. Then pour in soy sauce, a very generous amount of sizzling black pepper sauce, and add in some water or stock, whatever you have on hand. Once it starts simmering, cover it up and cook on medium low heat for 1 1 and 1/2 hour. Now, while that's cooking, let's make my super easy oxtail soup. After blanching the oxtail and rinsing it clean, transfer into a new pot and add in lots of garlic and pour in bone broth. If you have access to Korean grocery store, they usually have really, really good quality ones there. But if not, I also share my homemade bone broth recipe down below that I always have stock in the freezer. Cover. Let it simmer away on medium low heat for around 1 and a half [Music] hour. Okay, so now that the soup and the stew are prepped and ready to go, I'm going to let it simmer for an hour and a half on medium low heat. And in the meantime, I'm going to get started on the lemon blueberry loaf. I am so excited because I've been craving this for weeks now. So, let's get baking. A few weeks ago, I tried my friend's mom fruit loaf recipe. And ever since, I've been craving lemon loaf every single day. So, today, let's make one together. Because if there's one thing about me is that I always need something sweet in my day. This lemon blueberry loaf is honestly a dream come true. It is soft, it's fluffy, a little tangy, and perfectly sweet. If I had to describe it in one word, that word would be moist. And I know, I know a lot of people don't like that word, but it really, really is moist. It's kind of loaf that really melts in your mouth and the glaze on top. It's giving crispy cream vibes but with a lemoning twist that ties everything together. Of course, when I made the first loaf, I devoured the whole thing in one day. But for round two, I actually ended up wrapping it up with some saran wrap, pop it in the freezer, and now whenever I'm craving something sweet, I just microwave a slice for around 30 seconds and it's perfect. It's so good with tea or mid-after afternoon coffee moment. And yes, this recipe is super super easy and totally failproof. If you've been here for a while, you know that baking is not my thing. But thankfully, my mom is the best baker. Every time I have a craving, she somehow comes up with the most failp proof recipe that I get to recreate and now share with you all, too. I've written the full recipe down below, so make sure to let me know if you give it a try. I know my mom will be so happy to see your recreation. [Music] [Music] Okay, I have to do a quick taste test. This looks so so so yummy. Anyways, I'm going to go devour the slice of cake. The house is smelling so yummy right now with the oxtail soup as well as the braced beef. But you need to give this recipe a try. 10 out of 10. After 1 and 1/2 hour, the oxtail should be nice and soft, super tender, and flavorful. I like to skim off a little bit of the fat on top and then add in radish, cover, and let it simmer for another 1 and 1/2 hour. As for the black pepper short rib stew, the beef should now be fall off the bone tender. Add in your carrots and your potatoes and give everything a good mix and let it simmer for another 45 minutes until the veggies are soft and soaking in all that rich flavor. While everything is simmering away, I also put together a few of my favorite side dishes, the ones that I always keep in the fridge. I usually make them once a week so that even on lazy days, I don't have to stress about veggies. I just add these to whatever meals that I'm having and it instantly feels more complete, more balanced, and still super super yummy. And honestly, I think that's the key when it comes to hosting. Prep as much as you can while you're multitasking and have a good mix of hot and cold dishes that you can make at different times. That way, when your guest arrives, you're not running around the kitchen and you're actually able to sit down, eat, and enjoy the moments with [Music] everyone. And just like that, dinner is served. [Music] Family time is really the best time. And now more than ever, I've come to realize how important it is to slow down and intentionally make time for the people that you love. For me, life has become more about the small, quiet moments, the ones that you'll miss the most later on. Of course, I wish I could bring my dad to all kinds of new adventures, but if you ask me what I want the most, I would be just to sit down, share a meal, and spend that simple, peaceful time together. So, take this video as your little reminder to spend time with the people that you love. Whether it's going on a walk, finding a new local spot to try or cooking a cozy meal at home, be present, be together, and save the little things. And that's what life really is about. Hi guys, good morning and happy Saturday. I woke up really, really early today so I can have my favorite breakfast ever, which is hot rice, side dishes, as well as a fried egg. The perfect [Music] pie. M. Anyways, after breakfast, Dom and I are actually going to go run a 10K together. I'm now 4 weeks away from my half marathon race, and I'm so nervous, but so excited. This is actually my first time having a huge breakfast before a run on a morning. So, wish me luck. Anyways, today is actually going to be a really, really fun day because after a run, we're actually going to be celebrating Dom's birthday with my friend's husband. His birthday is only a few days apart, which is perfect because we celebrate together almost every year. I'm going to quickly enjoy breakfast, rest a bit, and let's head out for our run. Let's go run a 10K together in the rain. Tell me the truth. I'm feeling you. Yeah, I'm feeling you. Oh, be honest. Tell me what's on your mind. Oh, baby. When I lay my eyes on you from afar, I could swear I thought you fell from the stars. Think about when you're not around. [Music] Getting ready to head out now. We're going to go pick up the cake first. Head to Andrew and Ivon's and then we're going to head to the museum. Are you excited? Super excited. Birthday celebration officially starts now. [Music] We've been celebrating Dom and Andrew's birthday together for 4 years now. And honestly, this has become one of the most meaningful adult friendships I've ever had in my life. I don't think I ever expect this kind of closeness as an adult, but I'm so so grateful that we did. You can say whatever you want when it comes to horoscopes, and I know not everyone believes it, but Ivonne and I always joke about how we just get it when it comes to each other's husbands because their birthdays are only a few days apart. But maybe it's also because when the four of us are together, it just feels easy, effortless, and happy. We laugh so much, and it's always a good time. And lately, this really made me think about how rare and beautiful adult friendships are, and how much work they actually take. Ivonne and I have been training for a half marathon together. And during one of our long runs lately, we started talking about happiness, and how it doesn't just happen. It takes intentions, it takes effort, and we both acknowledge how thankful we are that we've always made time for this friendship. Even when life gets busy, it's easy to take those things for granted, but we haven't. If there's one thing that grief has taught me is that you never really understand what someone's going through until it happens to you. People can be smiling on their outside, laughing, showing up, and still be carrying a world of heaviness inside. And that's why being present, being truly happy takes so much work. It takes effort to get up in the morning, to tell yourself that life is worth living. It takes work to be here, to not shut down, to not go numb, to love others, and to love yourself. And in a world that's constantly moving, constantly pushing us to do more, to be more, to achieve more. I just want to remind you to give yourself credit. Give yourself credit for waking up in the morning, for smiling, for making time for your people, for being soft in a world that sometimes feels so hard, for not giving up even when it would be easy, for just being alive. and surround yourself with the people who see you, who appreciate your heart, who celebrate your growth, who hold space for all your seasons, the joy, the grief, the everything in between. Because life is too short to pour into people who don't see your worth. But it's also too short to not tell the people that you do love how much they mean to you. So, if this is your sign, say it. Be present, love loudly, and give yourself the credit you deserve for showing up every single day. Hi guys, good morning and happy Sunday. Today is officially Dom's birthday and we're actually heading out to Whistler for a mini station. We love Whistler. It's where we got engaged, where we got married. It's such a special place for us. And today is so so beautiful out. I have a few mini surprise activities planned for today. So, I'm super excited to bring you guys along with me. It is currently 11:00 a.m. So, let's head out together. Okay, everybody. It's the last rehearsal now. And Josie, remember to open the curtains on three. Okay, we just checked into our room for the night and then they even had cake ready for us, too. We are here in Whistler. Let's head out together. [Music] Heading off to Snow Noel. Woo! for the snowmobile. Snow snowmobile for the first time. I'm sure by now you all know how much Dawn means to me, but honestly, I don't know where I would be without him. He's been a constant light in my life, especially during the moments that I don't think I could have made it. I just finished watching When Life Gives You Tangerine, and wow, that show, it is so so beautiful, but also so so emotional. I went from quietly tearing up to fullon sobbing as the season went on. But this show was so so worth it. What stuck with me the most is how deeply it made me think about love and what it really means to love someone fully and to be loved in return. One of my favorite quotes from the drama was be with someone that you be happy to see each morning. So when life gives you tangerine, you wouldn't be afraid to face the bitter, sweet, and sour moments together. And truly, how lucky am I to have someone like Dom, someone who helped me through my lowest lows and never once made me feel like I had to go through any of that alone. We've been together for 10 years now, and we've been through so much together. From being just two young kids in our 20s, figuring out who we are to graduating, finding our first jobs, buying our first home, getting married, traveling world, eating our way through cities, grieving, healing, growing, and learning to find joy in the slow everyday moments. It's kind of wild to think that someone that I met on Tinder turns out to be the person I wanted to build my life with, but somehow life led us here. And I'm forever, forever grateful for that. They say you need countless lifetimes of fate to meet even once in this life. Maybe it's fate, maybe it's all the work we've put in day after day to keep choosing each other. Or maybe it's a little bit of both. Whatever it is, I feel incredibly lucky that this is a lifetime that I get to spend with him. Thank you guys so so much for spending another Dom's birthday weekend with us. I'm so grateful for this community and I'm so glad I get to share these little moments of happiness in my life with you all. I hope you enjoyed this video and I'll see you next week. Love you.

Next Level kitchen where the mentors of Next Level Chef are giving you tips tricks and amazing delicious recipes to cook at home and today guess what I'm up for a big challenge because remember I asked you my amazing subscribers to choose a protein you'd like to see me cook and guess what I think the platform is moving now what did did you choose for me it is oh oh my goodness an amazing rack of pork thank you look at this inexpensive an absolute Staple in the Ramsey household growing up but more importantly something easy to cook and really delicious now take one amazing pork chop first off before we start seasoning it I just like to cut just little strands of this little backstrap and what that does it helps to render the fat down and it gets really nice and crispy and as it Cooks it's like these sort of Little Pork scratchings let's season the tray start off with some salt and some pepper okay and in order to get those flavors in there little touch of olive oil pork is very dry so we just do a little teaspoon of olive oil onto the tray you'll see why in the moment from there smoke paprika that goes really well with pork a light dusting over the tray now it may look like a lot but the flavor across this pork chop is delicious next we got the antio chili powder a little touch of coriander and there powders right so easy to store and then pepper and all we do now is literally just get that chop you can do this the night before and literally rub all that flavor in to your pork chop and let them sit overnight honestly the actual color of the meat changes really nice and dark in the flavor of that amazing smoked paprika ancho chili coriander look already it's starting to look amazing right now as that starts to sit cast iron pan Touch of olive oil don't get that too hot okay just roll that round and then from there literally get your chop and then into the pan beautiful really beautiful now tilt the pan so it Cooks the back of that fat and immediately get your butter in there that stops IT from burning how many times we had a pork chop and it's sort of it's got a really nice color on it but then it goes dry I'm going to show you a really nice tip to stop your pork from going dry the secret here is not to go too crazy with a color just literally open that up that butter stops those herbs from burning but the fragrance on that pork chop now is delicious you can just start to see where that pork is really starting to break down if you can get this marinated the night before or even a couple of hours before the difference is night and day and the beauty about cooking this pork chop on the bone is I'm determined to make sure this thing is cooked beautifully and Incredibly moist now from there we got a little bit of fresh thyme into the butter and that's just going to start toasting again another layer of flavor touch more butter in there and look beautiful really beautiful it's crisping up the spice is doing its job and I want this chop packed with flavor beautiful now once we got the color on that I've got a little touch of stock okay pour the stock in and then get my lid and literally let that sit and cook nice and slowly turn down the gas now we've got the color on the pork chop the stock adds moisture to that pork chop as the pork Cooks it absorbs that stock and it's really nice and juicy in the middle Now suck attach one of my favorites having spent spent such a long time in the US if there's one thing I learned how to make was a really good sucker tach the first thing with this corn get it nicely seasoned just a little splash of olive oil salt pepper and just get that toasting literally on an open gas and what we want to do now is literally Char that corn okay and the secret of really good sucker tach is in the ingredients we've got a little butternut squash Red Onion some beautiful bell peppers and a zucchini first off slice the onion this is a rustic suckatash nice thing about this is that they can be used three or four times as it sits in the fridge it just gets better and better in Flavor now that corn is roasting beautifully and look at that pork beautiful every 2 minutes we're going to turn that por pork chop I guarantee when we slice into the middle it's going to be really nice and moist right turn that over that flavor on that toasted corn beautiful and again with the pork in turn that over let that sit and base the stock is a really important part if you haven't got stock honestly water's fine it just adds moisture but more importantly it stops The Pour pork from overcooking hot pan onions in here we go suck attach now got a really nice color on those onions take your box grater I've peeled that hard skin of the butternut squash I'm just going to grate this this a really nice way of sort of bringing this suck Dash together gives it a little bit of a sort of rich creaminess and grating really helps to cook this but not squash very very quickly and the kids love it and it's a really nice sort of extra veg that goes in to that suck attach beautifully done lightly season it salt pepper and now we're going to start building those [Music] flavors corn is toasting beautifully that's going to give that really nice charred flavor okay to the naked eye you think maybe it's a little burnt it's not it's ch and really good flavor once those red onions start to melt down start sprinkling in that butternut squash beautiful love that spread out in the pan get it really nice and crispy and now we're going to start building those flavors next are going to be the peppers first of all just top and bottom stand it up and then from there just take your top of your knife and follow it all the way down I like to cut around this seeds and so we got this nice beautiful slice of pepper again nice long strands in and these nice chunky dice for something like this if you had more time you can actually blister the peppers and literally dice the peppers the same way look at that pork so beautiful [Music] now start building the flavors with that suck attach keeping the heat nice and high get rid of that water so the flavors concentrated and turn that off there like that now and let that rest the next pepper same just a little slice off the bottom again from the top all the way around trying not to go too deep again and a nice large dice so think about the flavors the nice thing about the sucker tach it can be done through winter Autumn spring or summer I tend to lighten the flavors especially in the spring but the toasted corn is the secret that's what really makes this I'm going put the zucchini in last because that's the bit that doesn't really take much time to cook look at that beautiful M so good bird love it that squash is now starting to melt down and literally almost act like a puree got my corn and my zucchini left now beautiful that looks beautiful zucchini again top and tail slice them lengthways I like to go on the outside of the zucchini so i' got all that nice vibrant green the inside's a little bit spongy so no real flavor there this is the flavor of the zucchini I'm not a big fan of all the sort of seeds in the middle but this really does add a really nice texture to that sagach and then Look Back Together punch them up I like the dice it's a very good fit for when you're cooking chicken and pork and so easy to do in we go and now put a little teaspoon of minced garlic in and now with my corn slice that in half and then literally just stand that up and take all those beautiful kernels off and the smell and the flavor is amazing again off beautiful I love cooking corn like this especially for a salsa amazing in M now just to bring that heat to the sakach a little minced jalapeno and they just puree and Blitz with the seeds depending on your excitement for heat I love putting that in there especially at the end because it gives it that really nice sort of hot lift to the sucker tach my cilantro just sliced once not chopped fine and sprinkle that over and in and this is where we start to build those amazing flavors my lime take off the ends and literally squeeze that fresh lime in there so we start building that out now and it goes really well nice thing about making sucker tach like this is that it sort of starts off a little pan but honestly just with those few vegetables I've got eight nine 10 portions of this sucker tach and it's quite a spicy one as well which is lovely but it just travels so far and the yield is incredible beautiful rustic delicious and incredbly quick check the seasoning touch more salt touch more pepper and then just bring that together a little touch of olive oil at the end beautiful with what started off with a few vegetables look I've got all this amazing goodness and that's the nice thing about suckatash the next day honestly I've had spoons of suckatash sat on top of Salo bread with little chicken t to top that and it is so delicious and even warm or cold the next day it offers you something unique it's the toasting of that corn that's the most exciting part now for the plating this thing sits incredibly natural a nice generous helping of suckatash I've let my pork chop cool down in the pan roll it around inside those juices a couple of times I guarantee this pork chop is moist delicious going take a couple of spoons of those cooking juices and literally just go over and then as it rests with all that fragrance and all those herbs the flavor is intense then just some fresh lime and there we have a beautiful delicious roasted pork chop that you chose with the most amazing fragrance suckatash now thank you so much for watching Next Level kitchen and don't forget to subscribe for more amazing videos,1,The video is a cooking tutorial by Gordon Ramsay

I've got you covered. I've got five new recipes and all I need from you is 30 minutes. This first one is so good, you might want to double or triple the recipe because you can eat off of them all week. They are crispy, cheesy chicken patties, and I'm going to serve it up with a salad. If your kids love chicken nuggets, but you're tired of feeding them chicken nuggets, this is the dish for you. So, I'm going to start with boneless, skinless chicken breast. You want about a pound and a half, and you're going to chop them up. Kind of dice them up small. only going to be about three chicken breasts. This is a great way to kind of stretch out your chicken breast, too. It will feed your whole family. You're just going to add this to a bowl. I'm going in with a couple eggs. Also going to grate in some cheese and onion. And you just need a few tablespoons. If you grate it, then you won't get big old chunks in there. I'm also going in with some fresh parsley. This is something I just always keep on hand. It's just a really cheap and easy way to add a fresh kind of earthy flavor. A little ranch packet. I'm going to use half in here and half for a dipping sauce. So excited to make this at work because now my dinner's cooked for tonight. So I'm just going to stir that together and add in a little mayonnaise. Now I'm just going to season it up with a little salt and pepper. And then I'm going to stir in a little flour. You want to stir in just enough flour till it comes together. It's just going to help keep these patties together. Okay, so that's it. We're just going to form these into patties and drop them in a skillet. Spoon about 1/4 cup of the mixture into the skillet. See that crispy cheesy chicken patties. Each batch cooks in like less than 5 minutes. Cuz the chicken is cut so small, the patties are thin, it doesn't take that long to cook this chicken all the way through. Then you can just transfer them to a wire rack and keep them warm in the oven while you cook the rest. I'm just going to keep these warm in the oven while I mix up the salad. And then we're ready for dinner. Salad. My kids love salad. They call it a ranch salad or a Caesar salad. I'll add in some cucumber. I'm going to add in some tomato, too. Wish I had a stop clock. Dinner's ready. Couple chicken patties. We're going to serve these with a little dipping sauce. The rest of that ranch packet, a little mayonnaise. Then you're going to mix that together with a little lemon juice and a pinch of cayenne. A little sauce on the side. My kids will want that. This one is so good. Your family will inhale it. Maybe one of the most flavorful ways to cook a bunless, skinless chicken breast. Perfect dinner. Number two, taco Tuesday with a whole new look. How about taco stuffed potatoes? Grab your potatoes. Scrub them up. Just going to pierce them a couple times in the microwave. All right, then we're going to get our filling going. I like onion in my taco meat. After basically making that delicious dip that we love, the Rotel dip. Usually has sausage in it. I'm just doing ground beef. Now I just cook it all up in a skillet. Get my onion going for a couple minutes. You just need about a pound of ground meat. And then you're going to go in with some taco seasoning. Homemade or storebought is just fine. Once that's all together, in with your can of Rotel. Okay. Then in with the processed cheese. Sometimes everybody needs a little shortcut. Add it. And then it'll slowly melt as you stir it all together. And this is going to be the perfect topping for our potatoes. Hot potato. Hot potato. Okay, look. Everything's ready. Hey, taco meat should always be made with rotail. Okay, now we're about to make the most bomb potato you've ever had. When I do dinners like this, I just love to make it like a buffet and then the kids can come in when they're ready, make their own taco. We're always in different schedules, so you know, nobody's really eating at the same time. I don't really need butter since I have all this cheese. Really don't even need salt, I don't think. Just to really give it the full taco experience. You need a little crunch, especially with Rotel. Loaded baked potatoes in under 30 minutes. Oh my god. I'd like to be left alone with this. 100%. This is the next thing you need to make on your next taco Tuesday or Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I'm breaking out the air fryer for this next one. This is a old favorite airfried bang bang salmon. This can really be probably a 15-minute meal because it is that fast. Starts with a simple bang bang sauce. It's just three ingredients. Mayonnaise and then sweet chili sauce. This adds a lot of flavor. You can use in marinades or dressings or other sauces. super cheap at the Asian market. It's a good thing to kind of keep on hand. And then you're going to add some Sriracha. So, the creaminess and the sweetness from that is going to balance this out. Perfect. The sauce is going to add enough flavor to the salmon. You can season it with a little salt to taste if you want, but I'm just going to spread about a tablespoon onto each fillet. And then just pop it in the air fryer. Lightly grease your air fryer or you can put a little piece of parchment down on the bottom. The air fryer is the perfect way to cook this fish. You're going to get a little crust on the outside, which is so good. I probably should have started my rice first because it's going to take longer to cook than that salmon. The salmon's only going to take about 8 minutes. Okay, so I start by sautéing my rice in the butter. This will really keep it fluffy while it cooks. Two parts water to one part rice. You could use um chicken stock here just for extra flavor. Definitely want to salt it. That's it. Bring it to a boil, cover it, and let it simmer till it's done. Salmon's going, rice is going. All that's left is my other side dish, which are going to be green beans. I'm going to steam them in the microwave and then hit them real quick in the stove. It's all it takes. See how good these look? The sauce kind of caramelizes in the heat. If your air fryer goes above 400, crank it up. 425, 450 will be even better. These took about 10 minutes. They're kind of thick, so if your um salmon fillets are a little flatter, it'll take closer to eight. Just plain butter rice is good for this because we have all that sauce. And then a little green onion. It's perfection. This is a beautiful restaurant quality dinner that doesn't look like it came together in 30 minutes. The green onion is essential. Just kind of ties it all together. It's sweet. It's salty. The salmon is cooked perfectly. It's so tender and moist. It's the perfect dinner. You're going to want to make this one, too. This next one is so easy. I'm going to get my sides actually going first. I'm doing garlic, butter, chicken bites with smashed potatoes and roasted broccoli in half an hour. So, I'm going to start with my potatoes. Just going to get these going in water and then bring it to a boil and let them cook while I do everything else. For my veg, I'm going to do broccoli. My daughter just loves broccoli prepared this way versus boiling it. So, you want to get your oven going to 425 or 450. I'm going to drizzle on olive oil and then salt, pepper, garlic powder, and a little parmesan. I'm going to toss this together and then I'll sprinkle on the palm. Now, this goes into the oven. It's only going to take about 15 minutes, so just judge your timing based on everything else that's going on. You just need boneless, skinless chicken breast. I'm going with about a pound and a half. And then to a shallow dish, you're going to add in a little bit of flour. We're not generously coating them, just giving them a really light coating of flavor so that it gets crispy. going to cut your chicken into bite-sized pieces. Probably do this in a plastic bag now that I'm thinking about it. Just want a really light coating like that. So, get your skillet hot while the skillet heats up. I'm going to cube up some butter. You want to use cold butter whenever you're making a butter sauce. You'll whisk it in at the end and it'll stay creamy instead of getting all oily and separated. Then, you want to place your chicken in in a single layer. And then don't touch it. They're almost fork tender. I'm going to go a little bit more so that way they're really soft so I can smash them easily. And the broccoli's looking good. All right, time to flip them over. Woo! Look at that color. See these little like crunchy ones? M going to transfer these to a plate. Okay. And then you're going to wipe your skillet a little bit. Just adding a little more olive oil to help get the garlic going. And I'm going in about six cloves of garlic and more if you wish. Now I'm going to add in some white wine. Right now, this just reduces until it's almost evaporated. And I'm going to go ahead and drain my potatoes. Drain them and then add them back to the pot. Just going to set the pot right back over the stove just to let any other moisture evaporate out. And I'll go ahead and add in the butter and let it be melting while we finish the sauce. Liquid is almost gone. Now it's time to whisk in the butter. You want to make sure your heat is not too high. And then go in with a few pieces at a time. Sauce is good and creamy. So garlicky and buttery. Then in goes the chicken. You're going to toss it to coat. Okay, these are done. I'm just keeping them on warm. Butter's melted in here. I'm doing this with the baby gold potatoes because the skin is so thin. It's okay. It's not like overwhelming when you mash potatoes with the skin on with these. Smash and add a little milk, a little sour cream, and season it up with salt and pepper. Dinner's ready. I just feel like I ran a marathon in 30 minutes. Garlicky, buttery goodness. Tender, flavorful, juicy chicken breast, creamy smashed potatoes, and roasted broccoli. This is again a perfect dinner. It's just so simple yet so easy. Kind of just a new way to serve up your chicken breast. Roasted broccoli, don't steam it. You know, just adding flavor to the basics by just incorporating like new ways to cook them. Another winner. We're about to take it all home. That final trick uses our favorite packs of ramen to make a one pot beef ramen dish. And the only thing you really have to chop up a bell pepper. I love meals like this because they have extra veggie and it just kind of stretches out the meat. Satisfying and so easy. This one really only takes like 20 minutes to cook. So, this is the perfect weekn night dinner. I'm using the lean ground beef, but you could use ground chicken, ground pork, or ground turkey. Well, let's cook. So, going in to a non-stick skillet with my ground sirloin. You know, when we do one pot cooking, it's all about building the layers of flavor. So, the first layer has been created with the beef. You can see it's kind of caramelized around the pan a little bit. that's going to be released in a little while. So now I'm going to go in with garlic, bell pepper, and our cabbage. This cooks down a ton. So it looks like a lot, but it's really not. Five is a lot. You know, it's easy when you're just making a 30 minute meal every night, but I'm making five dinners in one day for you. Once everything has softened and that cabbage has started to turn translucent, you're ready to go in with your liquids. These are going to delaze the pan and then they're going to provide a flavorful broth to cook our noodles in. See, what do we say? Color equals flavor. We're going to bring this to a boil and then we're going to use our ramen. We're not using the little seasoning packets that are inside though. And you want to kind of nestle the ramen into the broth. You want to make sure it's fully submerged in there. Then I'm going to cover it and cook it undisturbed for about 5 to 6 minutes. 6 minutes. Voila. That looks delicious. All right. Now, we're just going to gently steam the carrots in their residual heat and then cover it and take it off the heat. Perfect. Got ramen at home in less time than it takes to get take out. Sprinkle of green onions and a sprinkle of sesame seeds. How does it taste? Well, let me tell you. The soy sauce gives you the saltiness. That hoisonen sauce adds so much flavor. I did use a salted chicken stock, so that helps. Another one that every single person will love and you can tweak it. You can add in other vegetables, use a different meat. Either way, you need to keep this one in your rotation. There you have it. Five 30 minute meals. It's a new recipe Monday through Friday. You're going to love these. Try them all and let me know what you think. Just so glad I have all of my family's dinners for the week.",1,The video transcript focuses entirely on sharing quick and easy dinner recipes

over social media they've been filling my feed they sound delicious so grab a can of beans let's start cooking the first salad I'm making is a Stak chimmy Cherry dense bean salad this recipe comes from Violet Cooks who I think is the one that made dense Bean salads such a trend right now she's got tons of great Creations this first one is hers steak chimy Cherry with a couple of my little twist you want to choose a couple different beans per salad so they have different textures the beans I'm using for this are pinto beans and garbanzo beans the pinto beans are going to be soft and creamy and the garbanzo beans are going to have a little more bite and texture you just want to drain and rinse whatever beans you're using for steak chimmy Cherry I have gone ahead and marinated a flank steak this is just a very simple flavorful marinade this has been soaking overnight so I'm going to get that in a hot skillet while the steak Cooks I'm going to make all the other components for the salad when you think of a chimmy Cherry you think of a puree sauce that mainly parsley some cilantro sometimes cilantro is not always in it but it's always in mine instead of pureeing that that's going to be the base of our salad so we're just going to chop everything up start adding everything to the Bowl roasted red peppers you just want to pack it with different textures flavors obviously and colors I'm going to add in some red onion I love the bite of a red onion what else do I want to put I'm going to add in some cheese I'm using this ranero queso fresco it's going to have kind of like a little sharp crumbly bite to it those are my main components to the salad so we'll add the steak in and then for the dressing that binds it all together it's the other components of a chimy cherry you've got a little red wine vinegar a little lemon fresh garlic goes in a little crushed red pepper oregano is very common in chimy Cherry a little salt then I'm going to whisk that together with some extra virgin olive oil give her a taste that's quite delightful all right we will rest the steak going to let that rest for about 5 minutes before we slice it up and add it to the salad I'm going to slice it and then kind of dice it so you get like kind of bite-sized pieces that go along with everything else that's in the salad this is a salad that will satisfy even your hungriest eaters I'm okay if some of the pan juices go in there and then we pour the dressing over as well you know that's going to be good definitely want to see a lot of green to remind you that this is chimmy Cherry I didn't even have to like reach for it m the beans absorb that dressing a little bit so it's like little pockets of little flavor bombs in there amidst all the Fresh Veggies the crunch the Savory meat that's good the next recipe is my creation I'm calling Supreme Pizza [Music] DBS think of all the flavors that we love in a fully loaded Pizza in a bowl of bean salad for the beans I'm going to do calini beans and garbon of beans this um recipe requires no cooking this is a salad that I would put in my daughter's lunches they would totally like snack on this throughout the week or they would take this in their school lunch for the protein in this of course pepperoni because pizza and also I'm going to do some salami I love using like the salami and pepperoni because you can eat at room temperature too salami I just love the salty bite this gives of course the pizza sauce is you know full of tomatoes I'm using these little heirloom ones you can just use all red whatever and then I'm using sundried Tomatoes as part of the dressing so I'm going to cut these in half or quarters if they're big ones the cheese going in this one mozzarella obviously these are the little mini mozzarella balls so you can just leave them whole or cut them in half I'm only going to drain off about half of the marinade because the rest is just going to add flavor to our salad on the Supreme Pizza you usually find olives and bell peppers and onions so I'm putting all that in there too this is going to add that really fresh crunch that'll complement those you know softer Bean textures I'm going to use Castle vetrano olives because I just wanted like the green flavor you ever seen a spoon like this it's for this to where the liquid drains out who knew Castle vranos are going to be a really mild kind of like sweet little nutty it's already looking pretty and we haven't even put it in a bowl yet I'm going to kind of dice the onion up in this one so that it's kind of sprinkled throughout all right look at that rainbow of flavor and now it just all gets mixed together smell that this is going in lots of fresh basil all right for the dressing for that really intense kind of tomato flavor to remind us that this is pizza so pizza sauce I'm going with sundried tomatoes packed in the oil I'm going to use the oil too so I'm going to put about like half the jar with the oil in a food processor two cloves of garlic and some white wine vinegar good pinch of salt some pep a lot okay a lot adding in crushed red pepper because I like that in my pizza that might have been a lot and then a regano again so about 1/4 teaspoon I'm going to get this pureeing and I'll drizzle in the olive oil and we'll just do it until it's really good and creamy I want this a little Tangier than I would like in a salad dressing because everything in here is like really rich and creamy so this is going to kind of you know cut some of that richness all right let's see think Pizza mhm mhm the beans kind of act as the crust you know everything else is the topping I love this one that's delicious satisfies the Pizza flavor craving in a much little healthier package did I save the best for last this one is a thae chopped chicken DBS all the flavors that you love and just a traditional like chopped chicken salad but with beans added for extra filling we're going to start with some green cabbage and kind of like chop it dice it up yesterday for lunch I had Thai larb and you get that like peanutty flavored meat and they wrap it in cabbage leaves so this is going to be reminiscent of that this one's probably going to be our biggest one cuz there's a lot that goes into here but again no cooking no cooking required cucumber seedless cucumber and then dice it up about half a bunch of cilantro one bunch of green onions I am going to add a little confetti of orange with some match stick carrots I get the ones that are already chopped up but then chop them just a little bit further and a little kick with some jalapeno I'm going to mostly seed it this is a really big one can you taste it I feel like you can taste it just by looking at it okay for the beans in this one at aamy does that just Mak sense for this one I'm going to do some white beans smaller scale some I went with a navy bean here that is not a caname has a lot of like slightly like crunchy bite to it so this will be the creamy to balance the crunchy I'm consistent people the navy beans are going to be just smaller than the Great Northern beans and then I'm adding in some chicken really just use rotisserie chicken here or any kind of cooked chicken that you want and then optional but I think not really optional some chopped peanuts this is going to just be that delightful extra crunch look at that is that not a big bowl of deliciousness hopefully by now you've gotten enough Asian condiments in your pantry that you can whip this up I think Staples include rice vinegar soy sauce obviously sometimes chili garlic paste you know these are things you should just have on hand rice vinegar is going in along with some fresh lime juice oh you know what this means it just works Ginger is something you should keep on hand it is so cheap and it lasts for forever in the fridge peel it and then give it a little grate I don't really want big bites of it in the dressing and a garlic clove and the little secret ingredient here is just peanut butter this just gives you that good like roasted nutty flavor makes it real Savory and kind of I don't know creamy and some soy sauce I need some I want like avocado thank you ask and you shall receive get that going and then I'll drizzle in a little get it a little tasty poo it's good it does it needs a little drizzle of Honey little sprinkle of salt and now we dress it look at that I feel like you can taste it from there see you just go in with a spoon you come out with a perfect bite it's going to happen every time this is it this Perfection I don't know what to say slightly sweet salty creamy crunchy it's really Sav and it's like super satisfying every bite is there you have it we have embraced the dense bean salad Trend and I think we nailed it this is three completely different salads that can double as meals regardless of which one you try they're all the perfect package of perfect bites you've got to try these out next time you're craving a pasta salad give the dense bean salad a try and thank me later do the LeBron chalk toss this is giv him big DBS [Applause] energy oh my God,1,The video content is focused on providing recipes for

Today we're cooking up something amazing. I'm showing you guys how to make a garlic chicken stir fry. It is absolutely delicious. Takes about 30 minutes. Let's get started. All right, guys. To begin, I have four chicken thighs here. Boneless, skinless is the way to go. I'm going to pat it dry. You can use chicken breast if you like, but I like to use thigh. It's more juicy. Once I'm done, I'm going to dice the chicken just like this into small bite-sized pieces, something like this. Once you're done dicing your chicken, something like this, you are going to grab a little bit of oil, drizzle that on there, mix it up together just like this, and then you're going in with your seasoning. Always mix the seasoning before you add it in. Just pour that all over. Mix it in. Make sure every little piece of that chicken get the seasoning. And you are done. I have creole seasoning, onion powder, lemon pepper, garlic, and some parsley in here. And my chicken is nice and done. Let's move on to the next step. We're going to begin by adding a little bit of oil to my mediumigh heat skillet. Then we're going in with the chicken. I'm going to pin sear the chicken for about 3 minutes, 3 to four minutes per side, until they're nice and golden brown. All right, now let's flip the chicken over. Ooh, it looks so beautiful. nice and golden brown. The aroma in here is absolutely amazing. Just flip it over. And sometimes you can just move them around here and there just to make sure all sides are nice and cooked. So, I'm going to let it go for another 4 minutes and then we'll remove it, set aside so I can show you guys how to make the rest of the dish. Okay, the chicken is nice and done. We're about to remove it so we can set it aside for now. Now we're about to make the sauce. And this is the chicken looking absolutely mouthwatering. We're going to set that aside for now. To the same skillet, I'm going to add 2 Tbsp unsalted butter. I'm going to allow that to melt. Once that is nice and melted, I'm going in with some bell peppers and onion. I'm adding the bell peppers first because I don't want to overcook the garlic. We want a nice flavorful chicken with the garlic in it. So, you don't want to cook the garlic too much. So, I'm going to saute the bell peppers first for a few seconds. Now, I'm going in with the garlic. I'm using two cloves of garlic. Add that in. And also, I have about 1/4 teaspoon of ginger. Okay. Going to stir it. I'm going to lower my temperature. While that is frying for a few seconds, let's mix our sauce. To make the sauce is very easy. You can make it before or after or while we cooking the bell peppers. This is the oyster sauce. Next, we're going in with a little bit of hoising sauce. This sauce, I feel like you can literally use this by itself. It's so tasty. Okay. Also, we have a little bit of soy sauce going in. Mix that up real quick. And as well as a little bit of rice wine vinegar. I'm adding my sesame oil in there as well. And also we're going in with some cornstarch to make it nice and thick. Okay. Can mix that in. And also I'm going in with 2 tbsp of water. And we have some pepper flakes. Okay, add that in. And that sauce, we're going to pour it right in my pot. Just pour it in just like this. Beautiful. Mix it together. Give it a few seconds to get nice and uh thick. Now, we're going to reintroduce the chicken back in the skillet. Just like this. Give that a mix. Just like this. And your chicken is done. Y'all see how saucy this looks? It is absolutely delish. You can pour this over rice, over pretty much anything. It's so good. Or you can eat it by itself, but I'm ready to eat. So, let's plate it. Looks so good. Ooh. That looks amazing. Quick, too. I literally just made this in 30 minutes. Easy, delicious, better than take out. Way better. [Music] And there you have it. Garlic chicken stir fry. Let's give it a try. Looks really, really tasty. Oh, that sauce. Imagine putting this over a bowl of rice. Wow. M m. So good. M m. Y'all hear that crunch? The bell peppers are perfectly cooked, not overcooked. M perfect. Absolutely delicious.

This particular style will never get your fried rice bad. [Music] Tim Tim, hi besties. You know when you see me, it's time to cook. I love to show you guys recipes from my own POV. And in this video, we are doing Nigerian fried rice. From my point of view, this is my fried rice recipe and this is a failproof recipe. This recipe h if you recreate it the way I'm going to show you, trust me, it will be your best seller. That's if you are a ketra or you sell food or you are a chef, it will be the best recipe ever. If you are a mother and you are cooking for your children, they will definitely love it. But generally this fried rice recipe you need to try it because um like I always say cooking is in the technique. If you get the technique right you will definitely get the recipe right. You understand? So you have to follow a certain technique. Yes. A lot of people cook fried rice and they wonder why do they make mistakes when you're making their fried rice. It's because you're using a wrong technique. And in this video I'll be showing you the right technique. Let's get straight into the ingredients right now. This is an aerial view of the ingredients I'll be using for my typical Nigerian fried rice recipe. We first have basmati rice. I like to use golden cella basmati rice. And this is what it looks like. Um you'll be needing chicken stock. Um I will explain why you'll be needing chicken stock very soon. Okay, chicken stock or turkey stock, not beef or goat meat or ram meat. I will explain that right after introducing these ingredients. You would also be needing carrots, green peas, sorry, carrots. This is spring onions. This is kidney beans. I personally do not like kidney beans, but I'm just going to add it for the sake of this video. Sweet corn. This is peas in a pod. Fresh one. Very important. You would also be needing some onions, some garlic, very important. You see these two aromatics? Very, very important. You need some freshly chopped pepper and then some liver. What is a Nigerian fried rice without liver? Edo, very important. And then I'll be adding some sesame oil, some salted butter, thyme, and seasoning. These are everything I'll be using for the recipe. The reason why I always advise to use chicken stock or turkey stock for your fried rice is because it has a milder taste. If you use um goat meat stock, cow meat stock, ram meat stock, it is um it will overpower the taste of your rice. And I don't I'm sure you don't want that. Fried rice should taste mild and still taste yummy. You want to serve all the taste of every the flavor of all the veggies and all that. So you using strong um protein as the base of your meat stock is going to just overpower the entire fried rice. So, I'd advise you use a chicken stock or you use a turkey stock and or any other um bread. You understand? If you eat um if you eat ego, I'm just joking. I go. Yeah. Let's start cooking immediately. The first thing we want to do is to prepare our rice. Now, go in with salted butter and then some sesame [Music] oil. Now, you want to go in with the rice. [Music] Time [Music] seasoning. Freshly chopped pepper. [Music] I like to do this process before cooking the rice because first of all the rice um the fried rice will last longer to last for as long as you want if you do this um if you try this method. Another thing is to create like a deep flavor with the rice. So instead of you just boiling white rice and mixing it with your veggies which will eventually taste bland. This method is like you um how do I put how do I put it? It's like you preparing a table in the presence of your enemies. I don't know if you understand what I mean. So you are literally creating flavor in the rice. So even without the veggies, the rice already tastes really good. So now um I'm using sesame oil in place of normal oil because sesame oil also has a very deep flavor. Do you understand? And I'm adding pepper because I am Nigerian. It's very important for you to add pepper. A lot of people don't add fresh peppers to their fried rice. And I believe that pepper, red pepper also gives it a very nice color at the end. Do you understand? And then butter. You know how I feel about butter. Butter is very flavorful, especially if you use like salted butter. So all of this cooked with the meat stock. That's the chicken stock. Your rice is already good to go before you now add your veggies. So, I'm using the stir fry method, which is the best method for fried rice, if I do say so myself. A lot of people, my a lot of people boil their um rice and then they add the veggies. No, I don't advise that. I always advise that you precook your veggies at least a little bit before you um pre-cook means stir fry. In my own um English, you stir fry the veggies and then you cook the rice the way I am cooking it and then you mix everything together and stir fry until the rice is dry. With this, your rice would not get bad. Another reason why your fried rice goes bad is because you use bell peppers. Bell peppers spoils your fried rice after a few days. Yes. Because you know bell peppers has this watery um um content which eventually waters down the fried rice. And again, another reason why your fried rice might go bad is if you use too much um spring onions. So, you shouldn't use too much spring onions. So, you need to ration your spring onions. It shouldn't be too much. You understand? And I always advise that when you add your spring onions at the end, allow it to cook a little bit. Don't just add it and serve. Add it, stir fry, and then you serve so that it can it can cook properly. Um the reason why it's getting bad is because your your spring onions is not cooked. And you know what happens when your spring onions is not cooked. It gets to it tends to get slimy over time and your rice is going bad. Now, please do not forget to add garlic when you're stir frying your rice cuz I forgot to do that. Very [Music] important. Now my rice is ready. I want to go in with the meat stock. [Music] Now you want to add some water to cook the rice until it is semi cooked. So your rice shouldn't be totally done. It should be half done. Remember that the rice will still undergo a stir fry process. [Music] So, while the rice is cooking, I'm going to prep my veggies. I'm going to be using this my big pan. It's my very beautiful big pan to prep it. I like I like space when I'm making fried rice. Even if you're making it in bulk, I'd advise that you mix your fried rice in a very big pan so that you can stir fry it very well. So, now um you can as well use a pot. I'm not saying you shouldn't use a pot, but I prefer to use a pan because um I want to I want to work the rice with the veggies very well. You will see what I mean. So, I give I'm heating up my pan now. Stir fry process is very very fast. When you are stir frying, you are stir frying on extremely high heat. Yes, this is so that your veggies should remain crunchy. So now imagine you stir frying with low heat. What that does is that it starts to soak your veggies and then your veggies starts to become less crunchy. But when you are stir frying, it is allowed to cook on extremely high heat and that's what I'm going to do here today. My stir fry process will not be more than 10 minutes for everything. Chop sharp and we are done. We'll just wait for the rice to be done and then we'll mix it together. that you see. I'm sure many of you might wonder why Chef T is not adding curry to our fried rice. I personally have issues with adding curry to fried rice because I believe that fried rice can do better without curry first of all and then again curry is a dominant. Curry would dominate the taste of your fried rice. No matter the spice you add to your fried rice, it's going to dominate it. Fried rice is all about the veggies and all the other ingredients that you use and not the curry. You can add thyme, you can add basil, you can add maybe you can even add rosemary to your fried rice. But curry, you can use very little or very little turmeric. You understand? But even if you use too much turmeric, you will be tasting turmeric and you have made turmeric rice and even the curry to you just made curry rice. So I always advise that you use very little quantity if at all you want to add, you want that green um look and everything. But then again, using this, using your meat stock, using um spring onions and these peas and even the green peas like this, the frozen one makes your rice naturally green. So, you might not need curry at all. Just try it for once and come back and thank me later. Let's get to it. Butter, sesame oil, a little oil. So, you can use olive, you can use canola, anyone is totally fine. I'm going to go straight in with my onions. I will saute the onions until the onions [Music] caramelizes. [Music] Garlic liver I'm going to add the liver so that can somewhat fry before I add the remaining [Music] veggies peas. [Music] This [Music] carrots, sweet [Music] corn seasoning. Like I said, this process is very fast. You need to be very fast so that the veggies don't [Music] overcook, kidney beans, and then the fresh pepper. The reason why I did not add the fresh pepper after the onions is I don't want the fried rice tasting like stew because that's what it will taste like. The pepper will just come in last so that it can just add do its job towards the end. [Music] Now, I've turned off the heat from my veggies. I don't want it to cook anymore. Um, the rice is ready. You see, fried rice is really easy to prepare. Just make sure that you get your rice right. While that is cooking, mix your veggies, mix them together in a pan, stir fry until dry, and your Nigerian fried rice is ready. Let's check out our rice. [Music] So that the rice is ready. You can even eat this rice alone like this without adding veggies. Now we're going to transfer the rice into the pan and then stir [Music] fry. So now you scoop and then you mix. [Music] You scoop, drop, and then mix. [Music] [Music] Chew it. Are you serious? You learn every [Music] day. Now you want to add spring onions. [Music] [Music] After adding the spring onions, just make sure that you stir fry until any form of liquid is out of the rice. This will also um strengthen the the length of the lifespan of the fried rice. You see this particular fried rice come next month it will be the same same thing in the same way in my fridge. This particular style will never get your fried rice bad. Following this method is the secret. Go and ask around. And then the taste you [Music] guys this is perfect you guys. Trust me. Come and have a taste. Come come come. [Music] And there you have it, besties. This is how I make my own Nigerian fried rice. Um, this method always works for me. There are other methods. I'm sure you guys have seen some other methods on my YouTube channel. This is an upgraded method. And I'm sure if you try this, you will definitely love making fried rice. Many people always shy away from making fried rice because they don't know how to make it. They don't get the technique. Please throw your curry away. You see that the rice is still green. Do you understand? So, you don't need it. But you can add very little if you want to actually. I hope you guys enjoyed watching this video. Um, let me know if you like this in the comment section. And as usual, let me know if you'll be recreating this. Make sure you share, you like, you subscribe and then I'll see you guys in my next video.

Look, $50 is not enough for us to buy tractors. It's not enough for us to buy a farm, but we will find ways to make money. It will slowly add up our money and we will be purchasing a farm, tractors, abandoned barns, something. Oh, yeah. Food. You know what? We might have to eat a few uh eggs, right? We do. We are sleeping with the chickens. So, we might as well eat some of their eggs as long as the owner is okay with it. Guys, this is going to be like at least 10 episodes of Back in My Day.

That's right. In this video, we are going to tee.com and order the cheapest products we could possibly find. Then we're building the setup and at the end of this video, you're going to witness whether this actually works to play video games on. And let me just tell you, as you can see, I'm sitting at it. It's actually pretty crazy. All right, let's load up the website. Here we go. Uh there's some questionable items on the homepage. One of the first things we're going to need is a desk. So, let's type in gaming desk and see what we're going to find. All right, so I live in Europe, so all the currency you're going to see is in euros. However, the euro is pretty close to the dollar, so we'll convert everything on screen. Let's sort by price, low to high. Here we have a gaming desk for 43 bucks. Yo, that is a good deal. Okay, we got to click on a model. Let's pick this one cuz it's got a little fire icon next to it. Yo, the price just shot up by like six times. This is the cheap one. This is the one I want. 61 bucks. Uh, let's take this one. This one looks better. It's even got wheels. It has six reviews. Uh, and they're all good reviews. It arrived after a while, but I think that's because of the holiday season. It's nice, sturdy, easy to assemble, perfect for small rooms. Obviously, we're also going to need a gaming chair. In case you saw in the intro, I'm actually sitting on a dining chair right now. So, yeah, I definitely need one of these. This one's been sold 1,800 times. For 63 bucks, we can get a pink gaming chair, guys. All right, let's try out a gaming monitor next. These are actually really expensive. 100 bucks. What? Three bucks? What's this? Um, is it just a picture? Easy installation. Why? What are the fences here? All right, the first one that kind of looks like a proper gaming monitor is this one. And they're selling it for 95, which is not cheap. It's cheap for a gaming monitor, but it's still 95 bucks. I was hoping to find something for like 20 bucks, but I I guess here we go. Let's go and have a look at a keyboard and mouse. Ooh, this these these prices are better. Oh, wo, look at this one. What? Yo, that RGB looks sick, but it's 20 bucks. That's too much. What about this one? 14 bucks. Yeah, 14, dude. You know how cheap that is? It'll be like $13 or something. It has 1,000 reviews. They're all five stars. We're We're paying for it. All right, we're currently totaling already at €237, which is this many dollars. We don't have a computer yet. We still need some other things like a gaming headset, a mouse pad, potentially a microphone. I don't know if we should buy a microphone. We don't necessarily need it for YouTube videos. We just want to game on it. Let's buy a mouse pad. All right, these are going to be cheap, right? Oh, wow. 50. You know what? Let's just buy a cheap one. €89 gaming headset. Okay, these are pretty good prices. I like to see it. I like to see this one's This one's literally two bucks, dude. All right, let's see. The first one that kind of looks like a regular gaming headset is 467. All right, you know what? I don't want a wireless one. I want a wired one. Oh, this one's wired. Holy moly. How could it be only €5? All right, add the cart. It has 310 reviews and they're all good. All right, let's go and look at computers then. This is arguably the most important part of our setup. And oh my goodness, they're expensive. 500 bucks. That's not a bargain, guys. All right, so we have these mini computers for like 150. But these things are probably slower than an iPhone, so I don't think we're going to run many games on that. If we sort by low to high, the absolute cheapest one we can find is this one. €380, which is this many dollars. It has two fivestar reviews, so that's good. It's got RGBs, guys. Okay, I might buy this one. You know what? Why not? Let's have a quick look at the stats, though. We've got an AMD Ryzen 9 processor. I think we're missing some information there. The GPU manufacturer is also AMD, 32 gigs of RAM, 500 gigs of storage. I have no idea what kind of graphics card we're going to run on, but let's buy it. 6% off. Let's do it. All right, we need a couple of more things to finish this setup. Let's buy an LED strip. You know, we're going to need it. This one's literally $2. I hope I hope my house isn't going to set on fire. I just realized our headset also has a microphone. So, I don't think we're going to need a separate mic. We are totaling at €626, which is this many. That is arguably quite cheap for a desk and a chair included. All right, let's check out and then we'll teleport to the future when the boxes have arrived. Hi. Okay, it's been around 2 weeks. According to the website, everything has arrived. So, okay, I'm just going to show you the [Music] boxes. Where's the computer, bro? How is that everything? I spent like $700 on this. I feel like we're missing some items, but I don't know. We're going to find out. The first thing we're going to build is the desk. And I think this is the desk. Is it concerning that I can just carry this? It's not very good quality, is it? That's it. This is the desk. In case you missed the previous video where I literally built my entire gaming setup, that was only like 3 weeks ago. And now I'm building one again. Also, please excuse the mess. We're still moving in. I I did tell you that. Oh [Music] god. Look at me. I'm such a pro, dude. I have all the tools I need. I'm going to build this thing within 10 minutes. It's going to be great. Going to be the greatest desk I've ever bought. What? Please tell me this isn't it? Are you kidding me? Uh, what? This thing's tiny. You can barely see it. How is this a desk? Okay, I suppose we built one thing. Let's just build the chair and then we can unpack the technical equipment. Sorry for the close-up. All right, I genuinely don't remember how much I paid for this thing. I think it was 60 bucks. I do remember the chair color is pink. Oh my god. Is this going to be an absolute nightmare? No. It's actually pink. Here's the part for my butt. Doesn't look that bad. Oh, that looks complicated. All right, we have more [Music] steps. Moment of truth. Oh my god, I did it. Oh, it works. Oh, I've got my desk. I've got my chair. Now, I'm missing the setup. First, we're going to start with the monitor. This was the cheapest one I could find. I'm genuinely curious how it performs. I think on AliExpress or other sites like that, there are probably cheaper monitors, but this is a Teeu video, guys. It's about Teimu. Here it is. Oh, does not look terrible. What? It works. Well, we haven't turned it on yet. But next up, I'm opening this. I'm curious what's inside. I think it's a keyboard. Where's the mouse, though? Should it also be in here? Oh, wa. Mouse pad. I think I remember this one being like two bucks. Oh, goodness. Flimsy. Okay. Keyboard. Oh, there's a mouse in there, too. And look, Chinese text. Oh. Ah, goodness. cuz I dropped the mouse. It's a keyboard. I mean, it's it's cheap. You can feel it's cheap, but if it types, it types. You know what I'm saying? Wait, what else is in there? Oh. Oh, yes. I don't know. It's a headset. I thought it was going to be um an LED strip. I I actually don't see that one. Oh, wait. It is here. Please tell me this isn't it. No. How am I going to plug this in? That's it. What? Okay, I do want to install it. Does it come with some type of tape? Wo, it actually works. And then the mouse. Cool. This This doesn't look that bad. Let me check the boxes again. Where is this PC? Bro, this thing weighs less than an iPad. This was actually quite expensive as well. It says it's a gaming computer in this. How? Okay, this is what it looks like. It does look like how I remember it. So, I guess that's good. Oh, it says mini PC. Dude, this feels like Apple. Solid box. Whoa. No. I Oh my goodness. I just took it apart, bro. That's it. That's the computer. It's tiny. All right. It came with some accessories as well. Okay. I don't know what it all is, guys. How am I supposed to game on this? A no. The computer doesn't have a mic plug. Only an audio plug. So, this thing is useless. All right, everybody. I spent the last 45 minutes building this setup. It is actually time now to give it a try. The real question is, does it actually compete against my $10,000 setup? I don't know, man. I'm going to power it on. How do I Do I press it or I think I click it. Yo, we got LEDs. You see that? Oh, screen. Hello. I want to play Minecraft. Come on, turn on, buddy. Something wrong. Oh my goodness. We got something. It just turned on. It literally just turned on. Do you see that? Oh my god, it's working. Let's go. Where's the lead strip? I don't even see it. Oh, it's on. Look at the lead strip. Okay, so the good news is the setup actually works. We're now installing Windows to see if we can actually play proper games on this. And if it's possible, then well, Teemo might not be all that bad. Even though this quality is just it's it's really something. Oh my god, that was a close call. [Music] Oh, it's going so slow. I mean, I did spend like not that much money on this. So, actually been sitting here for 15 minutes like this. Please like and subscribe in case you haven't already. I want to do more vlog type content like this. Let me know if you agree. I just need a friend here. I'm getting lonely. Well, I got a computer set up for them now. Editor, you want to join me? I don't know if this is good editing in rig. 5 hours later. Oh, it's actually been 5 hours since the last time I recorded. Yes, I'm a time traveler. I know it took that long to install Minecraft. Minecraft. It's actually midnight here. I'm exhausted. I don't know if you can tell. I don't even want to play this stupid game, but we're going to have to. Oh. Oh. All right. Let's start a new world. We're going to call it Teimu PC. I'm tired, man. I'm tired. Oh my god, it actually logged in. Like, guys, look. The world is right in front of me. Can I walk around, though? Oh no. Oh, it's so laggy, dude. I can't game on this. Why don't you sell me this? Let's kill a chicken. We got to kill the chicken, bro. I can't even walk in a straight line. I thought I saw a chicken. Oh, here it is. I'm sorry. Your brain probably hurts by looking at frames that don't look smooth. Guys, don't do this. I just bought a piece of rubbish and now I have to live with it. I'm actually not kidding. I kind of like the keyboard. I think the mouse is okay. The monitor is all right. The desk is rubbish. The chair is well, it's okay, I guess. But don't buy cheap computers, guys. It's a mistake. I think you're better off buying a console like an Xbox or PlayStation or whatever. I think I can even game better on my phone than gaming on this thing. Like, like, I'm not kidding.

I just bought this house four months ago and was still having no decor in such a blank space. It doesn't quite feel like a home yet. Every room in this house is decked out with stat gaming setups and aesthetic decorations that represent my personality except for the most important one. But that all changes today. In this video, I'll be on a mission to build the ultimate dream living space from multiple gaming setups, insane tech items, and some of the coolest decorations in the world. And here's how I'm going to do that. I first opened my 3D model app and got a very rough sketch of how I wanted this space to look. I then did tons of research, getting inspo from Pinterest, Tik Tok, and even interior design books, which led to a lot of add to cart clicks totaling up to 57 total items. Oh my gosh, this is going to cost so much money. [Music] Now we've just got to wait for everything to get [Music] here. [Music] Finally. Oh my gosh. I have never seen so many boxes in my life before. Well, this should all be fun to move inside. After taking all 32 boxes inside the house and getting every single one opened up to figure out where everything was, it was finally time to get started on the first section. Now, I am aware this is a living room and people don't typically put full-on gaming setups in them, but I'm a tech creator, so we do things a little differently around here. I've always wanted to be able to game and edit in every single room in my house. So, let's bring that dream to life. With having such an awkward corner, there's only one thing that can actually make the setup look good, and that's some good old wall panels. I previously put black wooden panels behind my main gaming setup, and to switch things up this time around, I went with white. And to be honest, I actually like it a whole lot more. Now, it's just time to get them put up. Well, after this pain in the butt project that somehow took me over 5 hours to do, we're already on to our next problem. I had originally planned to just leave these gaps as is because I knew these weren't going to be long enough to fill the entire wall. But after staring at it for a little bit, I just know my OCD is going to go insane knowing this is here. So, I'm just going to order some more panels so I can have them cut to fill up this ugly gap. After a few days going by and the panels finally arriving, I loaded them into my truck and drove them an hour out of town to be professionally cut because I do not trust myself using something like this. And about 45 minutes later, I finally had eight little panels perfectly cut to fill those weird gaps back home. Okay, after that obnoxiously long drive, it's finally time to put the rest of the panels [Music] [Applause] [Music] on. Oh my gosh, dude. This actually looks so good. Now, as you can see, it is nowhere near perfect as there's a little bit of a weird gap right here. But it's okay because we are just getting started with this section. Now, my biggest complaint about this space is the lighting. It just looks so dark and dull in here. And the actual big light to this living room is truly diabolical. Who actually uses these things? So, I'm about to light this wall up with five Goi rope lights, and it's going to look sick. I first strategically counted the spaces and marked where the lights would be put for the best alignment, which helped me to easily get them all set in place. Okay, that took a little while, but I finally finished it, and this might be the coolest thing I've ever done for a setup. It honestly looks better than I was originally imagining. I just have one more thing to add to this wall before moving in the desk, and that's this lack shelf from IKEA. Now, both times I've done this on my channel, it's been a way bigger shelf. So, thankfully this time around, it shouldn't give me too much trouble to get this mounted. It should be pretty [Music] simple. Dude, the black and the white contrast looks really good. This setup area is really starting to come together. And now we can finally start moving in the desk. I'm a super big fan of these light strips on the panels, but you know, you always got to put light strips on the desk as well. And that's exactly what I did with yet another Goi Rope light, which looked amazing until I realized my next huge problem. It's currently 6:00 p.m. and I just came to the realization that I don't even have a PC for this setup. I was supposed to start building it a few days ago, but with how much time these dang panels took up, it ended up throwing my schedule off completely. Starting a PC build at 6:00 is crazy. For this build, I didn't want to go mediocre at all. So, I did exactly the opposite by using top-of-the-line parts. Starting with Gigabytes X670 motherboard paired with a Ryzen 7 7800 X3D, 32 GB of DDR5 RAM, 4 TB of storage, which is totally unnecessary. All put in Heights Y70 Touch case. A big shout out to Height for sending me their case, AIO, and fans as it made this build go way smoother than they usually do, which once all put together finally led to the best part of building this PC, installing the allnew 9070 XT to finish this thing off. It is officially 3:03 in the morning and I am finally done with this PC build. I am so proud of how this thing looks and out of everything I've ever built, this is by far my favorite. But I am completely worn out and have like no energy left in me. So, I'm going to get some sleep and I will catch boys here in a bit. Okay, it is now the next day and we can finally begin putting in the actual setup. This is so cringe. I'm getting fingerprints all over the glass. This is way lighter than the other PC though. I can't even lie to you. And speaking of this PC, if you keep up with my short form content, I'm actually giving away an exact copy of what this build is. Exact part list and everything. The only difference is I'm not going to be building it, but I'm going to have a big PC company do it for me to send to one of y'all because after last night, I do not trust myself building y'all an entire PC and guaranteeing that it will continue to work. So, anyways, make sure to subscribe and stay up to date with my short form content. Now, the monitor I'm rocking in this setup is actually the one that was supposed to go in Slade setup last video. It's actually a really good monitor and I didn't want it to go to waste, but it ended up going to waste anyways because I totally forgot I had an OLED monitor just sitting in my closet. So, I decided to rock with that one instead. Now, to keep up with the black and white aesthetic, the homie Aiden sent out this sick black and white too malice pad, which I used to originally rock in my OG setup. So, it's pretty cool putting one of these back in here. And now for the two best peripherals in the world, a black ice high ground keyboard and an MXM 3S. Since this setup is pretty small and I can't put a second monitor right here, I decided to just set an iPad stand here paired with my iPad Mini because I bought this thing about a year ago and it's just been sitting on my shelf. So, I decided to at least get some cool use out of it and use it as decoration. That now officially wraps up everything that's actually going on the desk. And now it's time to move on to my favorite part, and that's decorating this shelf and putting something pretty cool right here. When it comes to me putting up decor, I always like to put things that actually represent me as a person. So, in the middle, I will be setting my brand new 100K plaque that I am so proud of. And then a Minecraft high ground keyboard to the left because Minecraft is actually the first ever style content I made. And to the right, I'm putting a Snowstone high ground keyboard because this is the first ever tech product I ever reviewed. So, kind of best of both worlds that led up to where I am today. So, the thing I just spoke of earlier that I'm super excited to put right here is a black pegboard. So, what are we waiting for? [Music] With me finishing everything up in this setup and seeing that it looks pretty much perfect, it's time to add the very last thing that will allow me to sit here for hours on end, whether I'm gaming or editing, which is an ergonomic office chair by CEO. This is the CEO Doro C300, and it's designed to help you have comfort all day with reduced strain on your body. As someone who spends up to 12 hours a day scripting, filming, and editing videos all while sitting down in a chair, I'm in huge need of some body support. And that's exactly what this chair provides with five high-tech features. It self- adaptive lumbar support forms to your body and ensures comfort no matter what position you're sitting in, which is great for me because I sit pretty dang weird when editing. It also has a flexible back rest that adjusts as you move your upper body. 40 coordinated armrests that move in every direction possible to best fit your arms positioning. comfortable reclining that allows you to kick back and relax. I could honestly fall asleep right here. And the best part about the reclining is it senses your weight to adapt to your movements, making your sitting experience comfortable and effortless. All around, I am loving this chair, and I already can't wait to use it every day when gaming and editing. So, if you want to be like me and enjoy all day comfort at your setup, you can get yourself one with the link in my description, and make sure to use my code to get up to a 13% off discount. A couple days now have passed since finishing the setup. And after seeing it at nighttime, that might genuinely be the best setup I've ever built on this channel. And the fact it's in my living room is kind of funny, but with this being considered a gaming room, I don't want that to be the only thing you can actually game on in here. So, I decided to get two of the best living room consoles I could possibly think of. I ended up setting both of them to the left of the entertainment center. And to fill up the rest of the emptiness, I added a mushroom lamp with a cool fake plant as well as a Samsung soundbar in the middle. Now, I know these cables hanging here look absolutely terrible, but just bear with me and trust the process. And although this is already a pretty big and spacious living room, there's always one thing that can make a space look even bigger, and that's a mirror. The next thing I want to add to this space correlates back to what I spoke of earlier on in this video of not wanting to use the big light. So, it's time to light this space up. Oh my gosh, that looks amazing. I know I've probably said that about four times throughout this video, but I genuinely keep surprising myself of how good this is coming together. And as promised as earlier, I did clean up the cables by sticking them in these little raceways, and I think it looks a whole lot better. Now, the next issue I'm encountering is I'm truly not a big fan of how the controllers are just kind of scattered all over the place up here. And I didn't want to just resolve that issue by sticking them in a drawer when we have a perfectly empty spot here for a pegboard. And so, I don't bore you with a typical mounting montage. Perfect. This gaming room is missing one last very important system, and that's a VR headset. When I was first sent this thing, I was having an absolute blast with it. Yeah. Going to the tour, bro. I'm going to the tour. But then it ended up just sitting in my closet and rotting away because I honestly completely forgot about it. So, setting it right here on the pegboard along with its controllers will definitely have me using this thing again. And now back to the main reason of why I mounted this pegboard in the first place, and that's to hang up my extra Switch controllers and Xbox controllers. And with Xbox flaw being that the controllers still need batteries in the big 2025, I put these clear containers here to fill them up with batteries just so I never run out at a bad time. At this point, it was getting pretty late, so I decided to finish the last few things up in this hallway by hanging up a cool Nike poster and then laying out a long white and black rug on the floor, which then carried us into the next day. This room is about halfway done now. And since I'm finished with putting in all the gaming setups and cool tech, it's now time to add some personality to this space. But before we get into putting all the really cool personal items, I really need to fix this fireplace. It's been bothering me since the day I moved in because it really just stands out like a sore thumb with this marble not matching the wall at all. So, a few days back when I went to go get the other panels cut, I made sure to get the measurements of the fireplace and marked up the panels to be perfectly cut. And then I was finally able to cover up this ugly marble. What an absolute night and day difference. Now that the eyesore is out of the way, it's time to move in the fun stuff. I am a really big music person. Whether I'm in the shower, making breakfast, or editing a video, I am constantly listening to music. So, what better way to display my personality than putting it all on a shelf right here. Hopefully, this little shelf doesn't give me too hard of a [Music] time. This surprisingly only took me about 20 minutes to do. Now, it's just time to get this thing filled up with decorations. I decided to put a record player on the top shelf and then fill the next few spots with my two favorite albums and this really cool see-through speaker. Then to finish it all off, I put an orange mushroom lamp and air purifier at the bottom to look nice and keep this space clean of dust. It's hard to believe this is even my own living room. Maybe I'm just self-glazing at this point, but I am pretty good at decorating. Lastly, to finish off this wall, I need to put something up here above the fireplace because it's looking pretty blank. But before we do that, I'm going to put down this custom rug I got from Etsy, which is a gray Nike box to represent my love for shoes and even has my name on it. Now, I've never decorated above a fireplace before. So, when I was Amazon shopping, this mirror was probably the coolest thing I could have found to put there. Mounting stuff in general already scares me because I obviously don't want it to fall off the wall. So, dealing with glass this time around is making it a whole lot scarier. So, please wish me luck. [Music] As scared as I was to put this thing up, I actually caught myself off guard of how easy it was. Did I get it? No way it was that easy. From my eyes, this room looks absolutely phenomenal. But from yours, it looks like I haven't done absolutely anything to this room. And to fix that, all I need to do is add a last few things that actually solidifies this as a living room. And what I meant by that was adding this huge black and white rug as well as a cool funky shaped coffee table, which I'm pretty sure when I ordered it, I picked the white one, but the black ended up looking even better. I then lastly added curtains with this Jordan frame poster to fill up space and one last goi lamp in the corner to finish this space off. I know I typically title these videos building my dream room, but I think it's safe to say I actually built my dream room. [Music] I can now finally say my house feels like a home with having so much personalization of things that represent my likings and me as a whole. I've never felt happier in a space. But y'all let me know down in the comments what you thought of this room as well as what you rate it out of 10 and if I should add or change anything because you guys be cooking up some great ideas in my comments. Hitting that subscribe button and like button is much appreciated as it's completely free and helps me out a ton. So, I hope you all did enjoy this video and have a great rest of your day. All y'all fellas, stay blessed and remember to always put God first. And until next time, [Music]",1,The video transcript does not contain any claims that lack credible evidence

but the biggest issue is this what the space looks like now yes a big slab of concrete and sticks which it leaves us with one question how we going to build all this out to build the ultimate gaming setup it comes down to a fstep plan one we got to draw the basement two we got to build the basement out three design our gaming room four order all the gaming Tech and five we got to piece it all together but enough of the yapping let's get started with step one unfortunately with the birth of my daughter it has eliminated our theater room but with that being said we crazy we have to get two spaces out of this to give us two rooms room one we have theater and room two the ultimate gaming room and with us focusing all on the ultimate gaming room we're going to have to blow this up a little bit bathroom things are about to get sweaty we need somewhere to rinse off okay we have gaming setup number one but as we all know I have bad spending habits therefore gaming setup number two but we don't stop there gaming setup number three you following me here you falling okay this is going to be our primary gaming setup we're talking PC we're talking RGB we're talking High Outlets low outlets in case we need to put TV up I mean all the electricity bills gaming setup number two we're talking console maybe PC cuz I I don't I just don't do console gaming setup number three gaming setup number three right here let's be honest we got to have multiple PC setups in here which leaves us about 500 square ft for our gaming room with a closet and a bathroom but most importantly a couple different walls to do multiple setups on but now that we have our basement drawn up let's get to the build why did you like to build everything out of wood you know here in America we always do things the cheapest way possible so we didn't build the home out of brick we actually built it out of wood the foundation it's definitely no no no Quinn up here it's concrete but no it's w like we said with this space we're targeting three different gaming setups so with that in mind we have to make sure we get plenty of outlets for all our Tech and plenty of ethernet plugins so that no matter where we put a setup it's able to connect so that's where we end up putting in 15 outlets and six ethernet plugins in this room alone but now that we got the electrical and the internet solved it's time to move on to the sound we went ahead and added in installation between all our walls just to make sure we don't disturb the piece of the house because well you know happy spouse happy house I am I right boys but if you have never seen one of my previous videos you know how loud I can be at times we're still shooting bro mouse mouse oh my so we went ahead and bumped it up a notch by adding this special sound dampening drywall so that no one can hear me scream when I start losing my ranked matches but once that was all said and done we just needed to throw on some paint add in some carpet and voila we have ourselves a clean slate just in time for step three designing our setups all right so I got some good news and I got some bad news the good news is we finally finished the build out here of the gaming room the bad news is we don't have a setup down here cuz we just finished building it so I'm using a old cabinet system and my dining room chair to plan and execute stage two which is designing the gaming room so I downloaded what's called furnish finder website that allows you to plug in the dimensions of your room to almost get the exact same layout then you can start plugging in furniture and other items and voila you have your gaming set up first I have fallen in love with these wood veneer panels that you see my boys like Sedum Will and Jaden have so we're going to design my walls black and anticipation for that so we're going to put two cabinet Towers on each side of the main gaming setup with custom shelving that I picked up from my friend nay Tasser so Shout Out n NE I see you and finishing off with a custom gaming setup on the wall right next to the main setup off toide NE n NE n t n n something like that now of course this app doesn't allow you to plug in RGB lights so guys what I would have to say is I got a lot of great ideas when it comes to that but you're going to have to wait and see now between me and you guys this may be the first time I'm excited to build a gaming setup because you know I'm actually prepped and doing it correctly and going in with a plan normally I procrastinate and just throw everything together but guys we have about an hour drive to Ikea so we got to get these things packed and we got to get moving quick let's go but for those of you that have never been to an Ikea count yourself as lucky do you mind pushing me around my legs are sore yeah because while it may be the Holy Grail of getting furniture for your setups it has got to be one of the most complicated places to actually figure out where you are in this place all right now that we finally made our way into Ikea and found the entrance we're going to need four things we're going to need some tall cabinet drawers we need small Alex drawers from underneath our desk Carby butcher block and shelving if we're going to make the greatest setup ever let's go see if we can find them being able to come to a place like Ikea and have what it feels like an unlimited amount of selection is amazing I think we found product number one lack see I told you I knew where I was going aisle one bin 21 that's where you find it so we haven't needed to walk around no we didn't no we still got to go this is actually where we ran into our first huge issue you see the tower shelving that we had originally designed for this space were supposed to have some opaque glass doors and then we were going to install some RGB on the inside once we found the tower units they did not have doors that actually fit them and my space has a ceiling drop down that cuts into my setup that is preventing us from doing the full tall shelving unit and so now we don't have a front face to our cabinet Tower to actually build the setup so the question is do we keep with the same theme or do we just kind of redesign it and go with a different layout I don't know but we should probably move away from the bathroom why okay Amazon Amazon so once we got back we hopped on the PC started the design work again and found some alternative shelving that we think would work so we rolled the dice and ended up ordering the rest of our items to Now launch step five it's time to piece it all together and why is it that these drawers are the heaviest things in the setup all right boys today's the day we're finally getting our trim pieces and you know we we had to get some professionals in here because if I were to be left alone in here with something sharp things would not end really well yes there is some yelling in the back so kind of what we're thinking is we're going to take this trim piece all the way across to this wall the wood veneer Hub had some sound dampening and if we have any leftover pieces we are going to have a third setup up on this wall that we're going to be cutting across and my poor man over there the reason why I brought him in here is uh we got a lot of outlets we were we don't have the patience for that kind of stuff so with the walls now complete it's time to bring in all our Ikea items to piece together the foundation of the setup I set up all this here just to get a really cool shot and realize this is where I have to build and put everything so uh so now we got to move everything out of the way starting with the drawers there's got to be an easier way to open that now it seems like the Alex drawers from Ikea is what everyone goes to when it comes to a build and I can see why because for 90 bucks you're getting a pretty decent quality and good-looking drawer the only power drill that I could find and you have to have it plugged into the wall so I'm literally having to build those shelves over there bring them over here someone down in the chat buy me a real power drill why is there this huge gap this is not supposed to be here this is where the small ones go I have installed this upside [Music] down we're leaving it and installing it like this I never want to do this again but unlike everyone else's setups we end up securing these lock shelving Tower units from Ikea to bring a little spice to the table when it comes to our decoration got to do we didn't read past step one mother trucker we got to unscrew it but within the same lack line they also have a full on shelf that we're going to be putting right in between the two Tower units don't die on me don't die on me come on come on come on come on nice oh oh yeah now we got to screw again um and to wrap it all together we got the carlby butcher block from Ikea measuring in at 96 Ines perfect I think the desk is long can you hold that side please yeah here let me worst T me why am I shaking this can't be right 4 foot three I don't know where the measuring went wrong here but the 96 in definitely wasn't going to fit in the setup so we had to cut it down to 82 1/2 because that is the precise measurement which helped us move into the next part of the build the inferior I mean console gaming TV setup wow these allergies oh my god oh no with this I did pick up a white TV stand and if you dare say Ikea you would be wrong because we actually ordered this bad boy from Home Depot now I wish I could complement the quality on this TV stand like Ikea stuff wow look at that countertop dude like it's not every day you see marble and torch like that but let's just say the structural integrity was questionable at best so now that we got most of the setup side things complete we're going to be moving over to the console gaming area where we have ourselves a nice 65 in brav 8 Sony TV that we're going to be installing so let but what is a console setup without a TV can you hold that for me he dodged it that was actually kind of impressive I knew you were going to throw it at me all right ladies and gentlemen we did come up with solution we went down to the barn we found these washers that we're going to be putting onto these drywall screws putting them into the wall not going to lie we're probably going to put about 20 of these in there and make sure that TV doesn't fall down I'm really glad we upgraded from uh this bad boy get in there felt much better than what I thought it was going to feel like is it ready for the TV all right boys it's the Moment of Truth we are going to put the brav 8 TV up on the wall with drywall screws and say a quick prayer that that thing holds up you don't even going to do anything I'm too thick I can't see I can't see anything all right up push back down it's up and it's not ripping out of the wall so good step one God this is literally the first OLED TV I have ever purchased but coming in with a 4K resolution and 12 HZ native refresh rate this TV is going to be killer for that one time a year I end up playing Halo Master Chief Collection I'm sorry I didn't see you guys standing there I was just polishing my 508s but anyways we got the TV up the only issue is is we did not put any drywall anchors into the wall so I don't know how that TV is going to hold up so we're going to start our PC setup because I at the end of the day all of us are PC Gamers we don't bother with console so let's focus on the real main setup well I mean console's not that bad oh it is now enough yapping about the inferior setups I know why you're truly here you want to know about the main PC gaming setup so let's give the people what they want starting off we are using this premium gutsy aen mouse pad swirl collection I may add with a little white and black aesthetic to bring our two colors in next we got the peripheral starting with our Lamborghini keyboard and ponage lightweight gaming mouse for those bronze valerant try hard lobbies you know what I'm talking about but with a good-look setup you got to make sure you sound good too so that's why we're pairing it with the road Creator bundle into this setup with the road cter audio interface and the road podcast mic all right we got all our purs in we got mouse keyboard mouse pad microphone and it is time for the main event our two main monitors and the PC let's go get them actually Quinn can you go get them I'm a little tired thank you what for our main monitor we aren't just going to be mounting it like an ordinary monitor we're talking wall mount Edition or at least I thought this was going to be a good idea the issue here is is I have never installed a wall monitor mount in my entire life I'm trying to get it like in between the panels that way I don't tear them up is what they recommend this is what I'm going to go with I think we're fine what what just happened with our drywall screw with our monitor I would be lying to you if I said I wasn't like deathly afraid of what's going to happen with that TV sooner or later I don't see any problems with that that's going to be I'm never installing a wall mount monitor again or if I do I'm buying one that's more than $19 this was $19 so I'm just going to be talking this one up as a loss and go with a standard ordinary Asus heavy desk mount for our secondary monitor and we had to make sure it was the heavy duty version because on this Mount we are going to be going with LG's new 45 in ultrawide monitor clocking in with a staggering 240 HZ refresh rate and 1440p resolution now most people would sit back and say hey I use that as my main monitor but for our main monitor we had to make sure we went even more overboard because we bought the Sony enzone m10s looks tiny when that thing's up there it is one of the fastest OLED 1440p gaming monitors that you can buy cuz it comes in a staggering 480hz refresh rate now do I need that high of a refresh rate No but do I want that high of a refresh you bet all right we got the mothership my prize possession bu by Yours Truly over here custom PC that we're throwing into here now before you guys roast me yes I do have a black 4090 and an all-h build I couldn't find a white one you couldn't find a white one this bad boy is coming in with an I9 13900 K processor a 4090 graphics card 64 GB of ddr5 RAM and of course 2 terb SSD essentially what I'm trying to to tell you right now is this thing is going to handle anything you throw at it at any time you guys should be proud of me because this is the first time I'm ever going to try to Cable manage but what a true gaming setup is lacking is RGB in order to increase that FPS am my right boys I think I just spent over I don't know $1,500 to $2,000 on RGB for this gaming setup credit card debt who but a huge thank you to my friends over at Nano Leaf because they hooked us up with RGB line and RGB display cases look at that that's actually so cool and so what I'm thinking is putting them up there on that top shelf and putting something in them I just don't know what yet so that's not bad at all we got those lines left and we got these rope lights and bro look at the disaster in here I don't know why but there's something satisfying about being able to have your own design with these lines but from One Professional to another I would clean your wood panels before installing these things or else um they have a hard time sticking I mean not that I would know they haven't fallen multiple times now but once we got these installed we still have the RGB strips that are going on each side of the tower shelving units the RGB rope lights that are going to go in between the wood panels on our console gaming area and lastly our tvt3 backlight for those you know more immersive nights on the TV now I'm not one for touching grass or plants like most setups so why not decorate with you know more PC setup Parts followed up with over $1,500 in gaming keyboard and since we have a bunch of extra PC parts I mean might as well display them right we have over 128 GB of RAM two Intel Ultra 9 processors that we're going to be putting into these display cases cuz I mean why not right and a 9800 x3d processor but with our PC setup completely finished our console setup still needs a bit of work so that's where we brought in an Xbox Nintendo switch some custom controllers and of course these PSA 10 Pokémon cards for finishing touches with our total setup coming out to a whopping $2,135 and that's not even including the construction costs but for the last 7 months we have spent our time building this gaming room from the ground up so it's finally time for the big reveal now that we got all the decorations finally on and I finally did cable management for the very first time in my life it's time to get everything turned on check out the RG this is it boys this is it I mean after after 10 days of building this setup I have to say I mean even Quinn said it earlier in the video I actually did some cable management because I sat here and I said with the amount of time money sweat Blood and Tears that we put into this we have to make it look nice and I got to say I mean probably best set up that we've maybe done on this channel I got to say I mean amount of RGB Cable Management um I got to say I love it listen I'm not even a big console gamer actually just seeing the backlights on this the RGB I'm going to come put a bean bag really big bean bag over here and just chill relax play a little bit actually might get me into console gaming over PC no won't that's has be realistic but I appreciate you guys sticking around the days the weeks the months everything that took to build this setup but guys if you think this setup is crazy we just built the world's largest gaming setup where you can find it right here make sure to go check out that one subscribe we'll see you on the next one",1,"The

sx08QC8fFRI5iBDnZngH23qlzZI,$1000 FULL PC Gaming Setup Guide for 1440p,Elegoo Centauri Carbon: https://us.elegoo.com/products/centauri-carbon ▻ My Favorite Filament: ...,Zach's Tech Turf,2025-04-18T18:00:02Z,"{'default': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/akr6JEaX-MU/default.jpg', 'width': 120, 'height': 90}, 'medium': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/akr6JEaX-MU/mqdefault.jpg', 'width': 320, 'height': 180}, 'high': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/akr6JEaX-MU/hqdefault.jpg', 'width': 480, 'height': 360}}",,akr6JEaX-MU,809,88591,en,akr6JEaX-MU,"For less than $1,000, this is a complete 1440p gaming package. We're talking the custom PC, monitor, peripherals, everything you need to start gaming from scratch in 1440p for 1,000 bucks. Considering we can play most games in 1440p higher ultra settings, I consider this a complete dub. Now, $1,000 for a full 1440p setup certainly has some drawbacks, though, and we're going to talk about those in just a bit. But if you're trying to save some money and jump into the PC gaming world and do it during this GPU shortage, this is the setup guide to follow. I'm going to do a quick review of everything we have here, including the parts of the build. We'll definitely be benchmarking this custom PC, and all of that's coming after a quick word from today's sponsor, Eligu, and specifically their new Centauri Carbon, which is actually designed for people like our budget baller community. Now, look, I've been in the 3D printing world for months now, and I know a fully enclosed, super classy looking printer like this looks like it's in that $1 to $2,000 range. But the reason I'm willing to have it be a sponsor is because it only costs $2.99. That's an unreal price for this level of printer, which is also as beginner friendly as it gets. After unboxing, you just got to remove some screws, connect the screen, run the self test, and afterwards, it's ready to rock. There's no in-depth dialing in or messing with the settings. It just works, which is great for first-time printers. It comes with a camera for time-lapses, which I definitely took advantage of. You can store the filament roll on the right side so you're not reaching to the back every time, and it's super reliable with the auto leveling. It's hard to believe that a printer this good cost this little, I'll show you what all I printed with it in just a bit, and I'll have a link to where you can get one for yourself down in the description. All right, so as much as I want to talk about the custom PC first, let's quickly work our way through the peripherals before we get to that. For a 1440p setup, budget allocation between the PC and the rest of the peripherals is super important. You got to make sure you leave enough money for a 1440p monitor, which is exactly what I did. This is the Kurui GN03, which is a 27in 1440p 170 Hz IPS display with a 1 millisecond response time. Most of you know I'm not your typical monitor reviewer. And to be honest, these days I have a pretty gamer dab perspective on them. But honestly, this monitor has been one of my default budget 1440p recommendations lately, especially for a project like this where we're really limited on the budget. First, there's a response time setting on the monitor that was defaulted to normal, so I flipped that up to the fastest. And for the built-in color profiles, I actually think the default normal setting looks the best. These colors and even viewing angles look pretty solid to me, especially during a colorful game like Frag Punk. This looks really vibrant and super clean. The GN03 also handles glare pretty well, so that was pretty much a non-factor. I will say that the stand is a little weak because it only has a tilt adjustment, so no height or swivel options. It is Vasa compatible though, so if you need that flexibility, you can buy whatever Vasa stand that you want. For a little bit of nitpicking on this stand, I also don't like how much surface area it takes up towards your keyboard. If you have a thinner width desk like I do, this eats up valuable real estate. For reference, this desk is 24 in wide, and as you can see, there's no much extra space available. My only other gripe is that this monitor doesn't come with a built-in speaker. I know they all usually suck, but personally, I'm always a fan that they come with one rather than not. Other than that though, I think this monitor absolutely cooks and I feel like it's a solid 1440p experience. It's also Freync and G-Sync compatible. And believe it or not, I turned on G-Sync to use with our graphics card, but more on that build later. As a final heads up, if you look at this monitor over on Amazon, it is a bit deceiving. I hate when companies put multiple drastically different models on the same product page because then the review data is a little compromised. Unless you look at each individual review where it tells you which monitor they bought, you don't know if that solid four and a half star rating is for this monitor or a different one. But again, overall for 150 bucks, I think it's going to be hard to beat and none of my complaints are that big of a deal. Behind the monitor, I actually hid one of these wide cable management clips that I printed with the Centauri Carbon. These have a little bolt underneath so you can fit it to the width of your desk and it works great. I also have another one directly behind the PC. I feel like having a 3D printer turns us all into a much more organized person because you can print stuff like this very easily. Next up, let's move over to the keyboard. And I almost never do this, but let's actually start with the sound test so you know what we're working with. Yeah, I don't know about you, but that sound is completely scratching the itch in my brain. These prelubed creamy switches sound almost as good as my ALA F75 Pro with the Reaper switches. So satisfying to use. It's so good that even homework would be fun on this if you're typing with this keyboard. This is the Royal Clutch R65. And for whatever reason, the Amazon page says it's a 60% layout. The name R65 and dedicated arrow keys means that it's actually 65% and I'm recently discovering that this is definitely my preference over 60. I love my Wooting H60 at home, but I do miss these dedicated arrow keys, so 65% is the way to go in my opinion. I'm also a huge volume dial snob, and I'm not going to lie, I think this volume dial is the best one that I've ever tried before. There's a notching click every time you turn it, and the satisfaction you get from it is about the same as pressing the creamy switches. RK definitely put a lot of work into the sound and feeling of this keyboard, which people like me definitely appreciate. But they also put a lot of effort into the aesthetics, and if you guys know anything about me, you'll know I value that probably more than anything. For this setup guide, I was specifically trying to not just go for 1440p performance, but also a sophisticated wood grain and black vibe. And this keyboard fits the bill perfectly. I love this brown, gray, and tan color scheme. And when I look at how this pairs with the PC, I honestly want to go right home and build my own setup around this color scheme. For less than 50 bucks, I'm extremely happy with the performance, sound, and aesthetics of this keyboard. The Outlet F75 Pro is still my top pick at around $75, but for the $50 price range, this is my new favorite pick, but be sure to let me know in the comment section if there's any other models that I should try. These switches are hot swappable, by the way, and the keyboard does come with some basic RGB functionality, but personally, I think just completely turning them off fits our more sophisticated cigar smoking vibe a little bit better. That's also why I 3D printed this fake plant here in front of the keyboard. Even though the Centauri Carbon only prints one filament at a time, you can still print multiple color things like this if they're in multiple pieces. Next up, let's move on to the mouse. And this one threw me off a little bit. Typically, I've been a big fan of the Attack Shark X3, so I went with it yet again for a budget peripheral setup like this. I know there's some controversy online that some people are getting fake units from AliExpress or something. Honestly, I'm not really tracking it, so do your research if you're concerned, but from our testing, we have like five of these around the studio, and they've all worked great. This has actually become my go-to default mouse if we do need a new mouse around the studio somewhere. This is the first time that I bought the black version, though, and honestly, it felt a little different than the previous white X3s that we've had. At one point, I had multiple employees trying to figure out what the difference was, and we came to the conclusion that it's the weight distribution in this one particular that's different. With our previous white models, the weight seems to be evenly distributed. But with this black version, more of the weight is towards the front of the mouse and the back feels a bit empty. Now, to be fair, when using it, for someone like me, this still feels great. But I'm not entirely sure if they are, in fact, different models of the X3, or maybe there was a revision behind the scenes that I don't know about. What I do like is that it still feels super smooth and accurate when gaming without any noticeable delay. The DPI switch is good enough for me, but Attack Shark does have a lightweight piece of software, which is actually pretty clean and minimal compared to most. You can adjust the DPI, polling rate, sleep timer, liftoff distance, and good stuff like that. I'm pretty happy with it, and for less than 40 bucks, it seems like a pretty decent buy to me. Right in front of the mouse is this super cool and actually functionable phone stand. With 3D printers, you print all the parts you need, like these little dials and bolts, so you can adjust the stand at any angle that you want. Now, we'll move on to the audio. And if you've been watching my content for a few months, you'll know that I've definitely been siding with IM these days. These are the KZ ZSN Pros. And I'm going to be honest with you, the main reason why these stood out to me was the overall aesthetic to match everything else. This brown color looks very neat with the wood grain aesthetic we're going for. I don't like that the cable is only 3 ft, though. So, if you want to plug it into the back of your PC, you'll need an extension or longer cable to plug into the IM. I did try gaming with it plugged in up at the front of the case. And I did actually hear some hardware interference sounds. That's not a fault of the IM because it's a best practice to plug in directly to your motherboard, but again, you'll need some sort of longer cable if you want to make that happen. Sound quality-wise, I mean, these worked pretty great, and I do appreciate the sound of IM's jammed up into your ears compared to a gaming headset, but at the end of the day, the quality didn't provide a wow factor for me, but I wasn't really expecting it to for $21. If I had to describe it, I would feel like it's actually lacking a little bit of the bass, but with my untrained ears, I'm not the best person to try to explain that, but I still think it's a pretty decent buy for about 20 bucks. Now, to store the IM when I'm not using them, I also 3D printed this little storage box. I have these literally all around my house these days because you can print them in whatever size and color you want. I absolutely love how smooth this print job looks and the color combination as it matches with the rest of the setup. And finally, the last peripheral before we talk about the PC is the mouse pad. Self-promotion aside, I did just go with a ZTT embroidered mouse pad that we give out for free with our builds on zTbuilds.com. For this wood grain aesthetic, I only wanted an all black pad and you can find dozens of these on Amazon for like 10 bucks. If you want a different design, definitely go for it. That's just how I was envisioning this setup. And for any setup that I'm involved in, I'm going to be drinking some coffee while I'm using it. And this little coaster looks pretty cool. Honestly, I probably should have just gone with all black, but this brown looks pretty solid. Again, this is fantastic print quality from Eligu, and you can print little things like this in like less than 30 minutes. But now, it's time to get into the PC. And before I show you the parts list, I want to talk about the benchmark so you can see what we're working with. Up until this point, the peripherals have cost a grand total of $267. So, that means we have a bit over 700 to use for the PC. I've created pure performance build guides before around that price, but not usually in a GPU shortage like we're in now. And for these setup guide videos, I also usually use a PC that we already made a video on, but this time I didn't. Now, make no mistake, achieving 1440p gaming with only $700 during the GPU shortage is a tall task, and we're not going to be able to crank up every game up to higher ultra settings. But with this CPU and GPU combination, these results are pretty solid. So, let's check them out. With Call of Duty Black Ops 6, we cranked the settings up to 1440p ultra and got a pretty respectable 94 average FPS. Obviously, you can get way over 100 if you knock those settings down to high or medium. Marvel Rivals was up next and in 1440p high, we got 76 FPS. Blackmth Wukong actually hit right on the money at 60 fps in 1440p high. Fortnite in 1440p Pro settings got a super smooth 269 FPS. And here's Nvidia's favorite, Cyberpunk in 1440p high with 76 FPS. Here's the rest of the games that we tested. And honestly, this GPU did a bit better than even I was expecting. We do have a dedicated full benchmarking run video on the ZTX channel, so check that out if you're interested. But finally, let's check out everything inside the build. And unlike my build guide videos, I'm going to rapid fire most of this. Just like the peripherals, I'll have links to everything down in the description if you're trying to copy this for yourself. For the CPU, this is a Ryzen 57400F, which I bought for $122 on AliExpress. I have further details and benchmarks in a previous video about this brand new CPU from AMD. But just as a quick recap, if the price difference between the 7400F and 7500F is only a couple dollars, then I still would get the 7500F. But if it's like 20 to $30 or you're on a super strict budget, then this 7400F works pretty well. The motherboard it's plugged into is the MSI Pro B650M-P, which is basically the cheapest microATX B650 board I can find. For RAM, I used this Clevbolt 5 32 GB DDR5 kit clocked at 6,000 MHz. The SSD is the Clev CRA C910 1 TBTE Gen 4 MVME. And to polish off this motherboard prep, the cooler for the 7400F is the ID cooling SE 214 XT, which is all black and super clean. Now, let's move on to the power supply. And this is the Raidax Cobra 650 W. Raymax usually doesn't have a great reputation, but this is actually a tierc model on the new and improved PSU tier list that's hosted on zTTbuildhelp.com, by the way, where there's all sorts of free PC building help. And since this was on a killer new egg sale down to $39, that was an absolute steal and a half. I'm also a big fan of the case, which is the Okono Cypress 3, specifically this wood grain edition. And this only cost $60 over on Amazon. It comes pre-installed with all these black fans, and the only thing left to put inside of here is the GPU. Now, as a very important disclaimer, this was not the original graphics card that I wanted to use. This is the MSI Ventus 2XOC RTX 3070, and I grabbed this used over on eBay for $290. The RTX 3070 only has 8 GB of VRAM, which is one of the biggest problems with it these days. And even in a game like Frag Punk, I did get a VRAM limit warning, which you hate to see. But like I just proved in the benchmarks, this card can still kick it in 1440p. These results were honestly better than I was expecting. So, I think we can still keep calling the 3070 a 1440p card, provided you're willing to game closer to the 60 fps mark instead of in the hundreds. Now, the original GPU I wanted to use was a used RX6700 XT, and that does have 12 GB of VRAM. That is becoming one of my default options for budget builds like this if you want to game in 1440p. Literally, the only reason why I'm not using it is because I featured it in like three of the last six build guide videos. So, I like to have some variety in these videos. So, you can go with either the 3070 or the 6700 XT. Personally, I prefer the latter option. Overall, though, here's the full parts list of the build, which totals out to only $3 more than what I was shooting for. The entire cost of everything on the desk, minus the 3D printed accessories, is $1,03. Be sure to let me know down in the comments section if there's different peripherals you think I should try out in the next setup guide video. And if you want to catch up on the last setup guide, the video for that is on the screen right",1,The video is a straightforward guide on assembling a budget-friendly 1440p PC gaming setup.

Welcome to Jello Impact, where we build and test every single character to help you decide who you want to wish for and build. We're almost at 100,000 subscribers. So, if you're enjoying the content, please consider subscribing. Every single one helps. First released in Fontaine, Gaming was a very competent and solid four-star DPS at higher constellations right from the very beginning. But I expected, as did many others, that as time went on, his value and power would start to show its age. and continue to decline and he would take the place as a usable but not top meta fourstar. But oh how wrong I was. Gming has received some extremely notable buffs from new weapons, new discoveries with artifact sets and of course new teammates. And he is now at the point where when considering top DPS's, gamming must be part of the conversation. So let's begin by talking about his updated build. If you're going to main gumming, you definitely want to consider leveling him to 89 or 90. Although he is an attack scaling unit, he is a DPS and a hyper carry, so any increase to his stats, in this case for level base attack, is appreciated. You'll want to highly consider crowning his skill. It is by far the most important part of his kit. In the past, when utilizing C6 Bennett, you could consider leveling his normal attack, but these days, you can stick to his skill and his burst. Leveling his burst basically just improves his nuke damage. And while still damage and still relevant, it's nowhere near as important as his skill. For constellations, the main ones that you'll really want to concern yourself are constellation 4 and six. He's basically unplayable at a high level until C4 because it drastically reduces his energy requirements. At C6, on teams with Favonius weapons, I am able to get away with no energy recharge. And while I don't necessarily recommend that, I do recommend something a little closer to 110 or 120. Without C4, you're going to need upwards of 140, 160, or even higher, depending on the Favonius and other units on your team. The other big constellation is his sixth, giving him a total of 80 crit value, half in crit rate, and half in crit damage. It is absolutely huge and just makes him so much better to play overall. Without it, it's very hard to get a proper crit stat line with his best artifact set, which a lot of people think is Mari Shay, but it's actually Crimson Witch. Marisay is a fine stop gap set, but if you seriously want to main gaming, Crimson Witch is highly recommended. The way that the Crimson Witch passive works is that it's a separate multiplier compared to normal damage bonus stuff. It's not just 15% damage bonus. It's actually an additional type of multiplier, which is extremely valuable for characters that vaporize or melt, especially melt. I know this set's very inefficient to farm in the domain, but fortunately, it's available in the strong box, and you'll definitely want to make use of that. If you're going to play gaming, you'll want to use an elemental mastery sands, pyro damage bonus cup, and crit rate or crit damage hat. You're going to look for crit rate, crit damage, attack, and elemental mastery substs. I've farmed crimson witch a lot and I used the artifact transmitter to get an actually good sans. So my build is overall very very strong. Lots of EM, lots of crit rate and crit damage. This is 100 crit rate after his passive and 210 crit damage after his constellation passive. It is a passive, right? Even though it's a constellation. Anyways, 210 crit rate after his constellation and his weapon. So that's some very good stat line and quite a bit quite a good amount of elemental mastery and attack. And as I said, no ER, which isn't ideal, but if I need some ER, I go for maybe a goblet like this. And then we have a little less crit damage, but we have some more ER, so it's a bit more comfy. Looking at weapons, what is Gumming's best weapon? Well, overall, if you have the Fruitful Hook, it is almost exactly on par at refinement 5 with 1,000 Blazing Suns. I find it pretty awesome that they made it aesthetically work with him. I think I'll probably level it up eventually, but for right now, I'm just being efficient and using a Thousand Blazing Suns on him. Neither of them is enough of an upgrade over the other to bother me recommending going for one or the other. But if you happen So if you happen to have either one, they can both be great. If I were to recommend someone go for something for gaming, it's definitely going to be a thousand blazing suns because on average it's much much cheaper to get a refinement one fivestar weapon than a refinement five four-star weapon. One thing to note is if you do happen to go for C2 Shenyun, Fruitful Hook does pass Thousand Blazing Suns overall for his damage. other weapons. This is the Kaching main's website. They're linked down below. But the serpent spine is excellent for him, especially if you have high refinement. Verdict is solid. Rain Slasher is solid. Wol's Gravestor and and then Tidal Shadow is his best free weapon, but I really would recommend eventually going for a five-star weapon for him, in particular, Mika's weapon if you want to see like really excellent results. And you probably end up with a rain slasher and you could probably get away with that for a while. Um, this particular list was updated before Thousand Blazing Suns and Fruitful Hook came out and both of those outpass the Serpent Spine. And just to double down, some people do believe that Marishi Hunter is his most recommendable artifact set. I have found personally much better results with the Crimson Witch. If I learn anything new about that, I'll update in the pin comments. Same with all of the stuff. For gameplay tips, the main one I have is to do your best to learn to watch for the elemental aura on the enemy. It's very important, especially if you play him on his best teams, which is a cryo team with seat loi, that you make sure that the enemy has the cryo aura available before you plunge. Failing to do this and plunging before the enemy has a cryoora will completely wreck your damage. It will take two cryo hits for seat loi to overcome the application, maybe even more. And it basically means a reset. So, if you're going to play Gaming, you have to watch for the cryo aura so that you can melt every hit. Plus, Gaming does so few hits that missing a melt is really big for his damage. That being said, usually this isn't a huge issue because Seali does apply cryo at a fairly reasonable clip. And unless you're very unlucky and very fast with spamming your skill button, she will almost always apply enough cryo that you can melt all of your hits without issue. There is not enough cryo to ever do any normal attacks. So, it's very important you do not ever normal attack if you want to melt all of your skills. To use your skill, you will have to wait for the lion to run back to you. Sometimes it can be helpful to run in the direction the lion is at so that you can use your skill a little bit faster. In addition, for Ging to use his skill, you will need to have the enemy available on the field for him to hit with his skill. He doesn't do damage with the hit of his skill, but for him to go up in the air, he needs to hit the enemy. So, if the perpetual mechanical array, for example, is up in the air, you won't be able to use his his skill and get a plunge. It will be a waste. For his rotation, you will almost always want to open with your skill. Then use your setup character, the buffing character that is flexible. We'll talk about them in the team section. Then use Bennett skill and burst. Then use Seali skill and burst. Sometimes you'll need to normal attack with Calali to make sure that there is a cryoora on the enemy before opening your gumming rotation with your burst and then spamming skill until the duration runs out. It is often worth it, especially on teams with shalon or an animo character to use one extra skill after the cryoa is gone to apply pyro to the enemy so that you can swirl or react or whatever with pyro to begin your setup again. Ooh, we got the dark colored one. Very cool. Very cool. For teams, I would consider this to be the standard go-to team for Gaming. In single target, Shenyun will be the best, but she is the most replaceable unit on this team. Bennett is pretty much required as he provides some much needed attack buff, pyro resonance, and energy for Guming, and he's frankly perfect for this team. Does mean you'll be playing a bit of circle impact, but what else is new? Seat loi is also absolutely required on this team as she both provides the res shred, the scroll buff, and the cryo elemental application to allow gaming to melt. She can run thrilling tales or her signature. Bennett can go on instructors or no blast. And then the final slot, Shenyun is the best in single target in particular in AoE. Sucross is better. Shenyun overall still nudges her out in single target. And then Shalon is the best in AoE, especially AoE that has multiwave. Yansan if you happen to happen to have a copy is also a viable slot on this team as is Kazuha. So you have lots and lots of options that are all very very clearable and very very close to each other frankly in terms of overall performance. You could use C4 Lan although I would say in this particular case because you already have Sali giving a shield that she's just a strict downgrade from Sucross but maybe you don't have Sucross. So Lion's an option assuming again you have C4. You can also use a cryo option such as Diona. her C6 gives a big elemental mastery buff and if you happen to have Elegy of the End as a weapon, that's a good option in this spot. Chong Yun you could use to reduce some rotation times. Overall, there's a decent amount of options. You are also able to slot Seali if you don't have her for something like C6 Kaya or Rosaria. I've never liked any of the other melt teams personally. I've never been able to get them to work consistently, but theoretically you can substitute her and still play Melt. You can also use Fina. You will only vape obviously with Fina which is definitely not as good as melting but it is still clearable and if you don't have seat lolli and you do have fina and you still want to play gumming teams this is definitely something that will allow you to 36 star the abyss and will allow you to clear it is not awful but if you're seriously going to play gumming I definitely do recommend sit in the future although I to be fair I only have C0 fina maybe with C1 or C2 it could be fine to not upgrade but that's of course assuming you already have C1 or C2 Fina and you're not directly comparing C1 or like a C2 seed LOI in which case this team would be crazy. Also considering vertical investment, Shen Yun C2 is absolutely nuts for the team. And if she does have that, then she becomes far and away the best option in this slot. As you all know, I have been testing very seriously every single character. And I have noted all of Gaming's times. As you can see, Gaming with Shenyun Bennett Sidali is right here. um he was a lot slower than other meta teams in this particular testing chamber with the multi-wave ruin enemies. If we look at his older teams, he was much closer to the top of the meta. As you can see with Shalon and Bennett at St. Li in the previous test, he was at 38 seconds, which is right there with anything non-MA related. In fact, I believe he was the fastest non-MA time if of any team. So if we look at non- MUA teams, the next fastest was Mulani at 40 seconds and then the next non-Mani team that was fastest was Novallet or sorry non-Mika team and then Arlino and then Chlorand. So in the previous abyss he was right up there with the very very top dogs. He was the top non-Mika dog in the previous Abyss which is just extremely very impressive. And in the t in the test before that, the abyss before that, which was against the big Snorlax guy, he still got a very respectable time close to C1 R1 Huttowo and Arleino was heavily buffed from the normal attack. So once again, pretty close to the top of non Moa teams. Very, very impressive stuff from Gaming. Looking at his value and power level. Well, the value of Gaming if you happen to get him without having to wish for him. So, if you got him alongside wishing for other characters and picking him as the lantern rate selector, then that's pretty insane value to be able to get a character that is a contender for a top meta without costing you a fivestar slot. One thing to keep in mind is the supports he needs are exactly the supports Moa needs. They basically have the same best teams identically. This is a problem because if you're a Moika enjoyer, then Gaming basically doesn't have a team on your account if you're hoping to use Moa in her traditional hyper carry setup. However, if you're a Clarand main or a Navia main or a Kenich main or some other character that doesn't use Seat Li and Bennett, then Gaming can utilize those Moika core supports and form a very strong team. While on the other side, Moa can support some other character like Chloran or Navia. So that's kind of cool in that way. Gaming also uses the same supports as Arleekino. So I would say that in terms of value, his value does take a hit. If you're an account that does have Moa, but especially in the case of Mika, unlike Arleino, there is more things she can do to support and like dual be a real dual DPS with other characters. Novallet's also a character that Mu can dual DPS with as is Mulani. These are characters that don't take Bennett Seali. And then Gaming can have those supports and Muika can support Novallet, Mulani, Chloran, Vessa. Obviously, Veressa is better than Chlorand, but you know, I'm trying to push that out of my mind. Um, or Navia. So, not all hope is lost when it comes to value. Um, he does still require very good artifact quality, but that is pretty much the case for all characters these days. And at least with his C6, he does get a bunch of crit rate and crit damage, so that's nice. Um, and in terms of power, I really underrated him on my last tier list. His melt stuff is much easier to play than I gave it credit for. I would put him in the line in the same category. Basically, I have Moa and then all the other great DPS's in the same line and he belongs with the other great DPS's which is very very impressive to say. He is the only fourstar even close to that category. All the other four-star DPS's are at least two or three tiers below Gaming. His performance is unmatched in terms of four stars and he's great. Uh for overworld, he's pretty terrible in the overworld. He doesn't have like much in the way of exploration stuff. Um, his damage is tied to his burst state. You need to have his burst up to do damage. And he doesn't do any damage with his regular normal attacks. Um, unless maybe you're doing C6 Bennett infusion stuff. So overall, yeah, I don't really like him in the overworld, but hey, you can't have everything. Um, at least his overworld team can have Shenyion on it, so at least that. But, you know, the overworld isn't like the biggest thing in the whole world, so that's fine. And in terms of new player friendliness, given that he does need high constellations, he may or may not be new player friendly depending on maybe you started right around lantern, right? Maybe you wish on his banner, then he's new player friendly. In terms of free-to-play friendliness, it's like he's like halfway there. Like he needs Bennett, but the Shenan slot is very flexible and he does need seat loi, but you know, Bennett's pretty easy to get. All you need is his C1 and then so you just need to wish for seat loi and then you can have a great gumming. So, I would say he's reasonably um free-to-play friendly, new player friendly, etc. Not crazy because of the C6 and you know, and if you want him to do really good, then you want him to have a thousand blazing suns or the fruit. Let me know if you built Gaming and how you think he is overall. Personally, I think Genchin should do this more. I think they should release another four-star DPS that's really, really strong. Um, I would like Gaming to be, you know, not as much of an exception as he is, but I'm happy he exists. And once again, subscribe if you want to see more guides like this. And if you don't want to do that, that's totally fine. Just watching the video has been more than enough. Thanks so much. Bye for now.

a PC tutorial guide for 2025 i have to start   out by saying it's actually not the best time 
to build a computer right now because GPUs are   in shortage so the system that I am going 
to be building should cost around $1,200 to   $1,300 but you might need to give it a little 
bit of time for GPU prices to come down the   rest of the parts are currently available 
the core system is around $650 - add 600   bucks for a 9070 XT or even 550 bucks 
for a 9070 will get you a really nice   high-performing system and I really hope the 
prices come down so that becomes a reality soon excellent today's video is brought to you by 
Thermaltake TR100 mini tower case and travel   trunk the TR100 is a diminutive but full featured 
dual chamber chassis with a surprisingly roomy   interior for high-end PC builds available in a 
variety of colors with support for up to 360 mm   GPUs and a 280 mm AIO radiator on top the modular 
design means side panels are all removable for   cable management and upgrades include an optional 
LCD panel or the travel trunk to easily take your   TR100 gaming PC setup on the go for more on the 
TR100 mini tower case from Thermaltake check out   my build or click the sponsor link in the video 
description the first step to building a new   computer is choosing the parts that you'll build 
with and I have lots of videos on that so I highly   recommend checking out my monthly build series 
which is called Build Fix or if you check out   my three-part tutorial from a couple years back I 
have a full guide on all the individual parts and   uh what they are and what they do please note that 
we are building just the core PC today for around   again $1,200 to $1,300 and if you're building a 
whole system you're going to need peripherals a   keyboard and mouse at least as well as a monitor 
i'll include some additional links in the   description for some recommended options for that 
and you want to budget probably a couple hundred   more dollars if you don't have those available 
already when I describe the core components of a   gaming PC for a new builder I like to start with 
a seven-part list you could maybe say it's an   eight-part list if you separate the CPU and the 
CPU's cooler but I'm going to run down each of   those for you now and we're actually going to save 
the GPU for last so number one is the CPU for that   I'm recommending you build on the AM5 platform 
right now which means you're going to get an   AMD processor that platform is where you'll find 
the best chips for gaming as well as some decent   entry-level more budgetoriented options like the 
ones that I have here there are two generations of   CPUs currently available on AM5 the 7000 series 
and the 9000 series and the six cores are going   to be the 7600 and the 7600X which is this one 
right here the X means that it ships in a thin   box which does not have a CPU cooler in it so you 
will need to buy a CPU cooler separately but the X   CPUs also run at a slightly higher frequency if 
you go with a 7600 non X it comes in a slightly   bigger box and it will ship with a cooler for 
the CPU which is known as a stock heat sink fan   so for budget builders right now the 7600 is your 
best bet because it comes with that heatsink fan   if you want to spend a little bit more money for a 
little bit more speed but also get a cooler that's   going to run a bit quieter for you then the 7600X 
is probably going to be your best bet there's also   the 9600 and 9600X which will also be a little bit 
faster than the 7000 series processors but these   still don't have the best prices so it's worth 
checking the 9600 and 9600X but if you really   want to upgrade from the 7600 or 7600X I recommend 
one of the X3D processors like the 9800X3D because   that will be your best bet for gaming also adding 
more cores is going to be good not necessarily for   gaming but if you're going to do production 
workloads video editing or any sort of heavy   lifting with your system if you don't get a CPU 
that includes a cooler you will need to add one   on because your CPU does need a cooler fortunately 
there are some really good air coolers available   for around $ 35 to $40 we're going to be using the 
Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120 Evo today which is   going to give us a nice cool and quiet running 
experience that leads us into item two which is   our motherboard i consider our first three items 
the CPU the motherboard and the memory to all   be kind of tied together the motherboard sits at 
the center of the system and this is really what   everything plugs into so it will have a socket 
we're going with socket AM5 and your socket   needs to match your CPU so if you're building 
on an Intel platform for example which I don't   necessarily recommend right now because I just 
think that AMD has a better solution at the moment   but you'll also want to match up your CPU socket 
with the motherboard that you've chosen for AM5   there are two serieses of chipsets the 600 series 
and the 800 series we're going with the last gen   B650 chipset cuz you don't necessarily get a 
lot of extra performance by going with an 800   series chipset you might get more connectivity by 
going with the X870e or even X670 or X670E but if   you're trying to keep your costs down and you're 
looking for an AM5 motherboard for $150 or less   then you'll probably want to go B650 item number 
three is memory this is system memory also known   as volatile memory because it only stores data 
while the system is on so yes it is temporary but   it is also very fast the standard for the current 
gen platform AM5 motherboards is DDR5 so we have a   DDR5 memory kit here the other specs you want to 
pay attention to are the capacity of course this   is a 2x6 gig kit two sticks means we can run in 
dual channel mode two 16 gig sticks gives us 32 GB   total which is my recommendation for starting off 
with a gaming PC and should be all you need for   now and lastly you want to check the speed this is 
a DDR5 6000 speed kit which is what I recommend so   go for DDR5 6000 and then see that last number CL 
cast latency make that number as low as possible   cl 32 30 or 28 is a good number to shoot for items 
number four five and six are our case power supply   and storage let's start off with item number four 
which is our case a case provides a housing for   your PC hardware it provides some protection for 
it it makes it so you can pick up the whole thing   and move it somewhere else if you want to you 
can actually get by without a case but I don't   necessarily recommend that because the other thing 
a case will often include is some fans to help   direct air across your components and keep them 
cool and that is an important part of a long-term   PC health the cool thing about cases is there's 
lots of really good ones available for around   $60 to $100 some that even include some fans and 
my go-to just recently has been the Fantex XT Pro   because it's a standard size ATX case which means 
it has broad compatibility it has a plexi side   panel so you can take a look at your build after 
it's put together and if you get the slightly   upgraded version which is about $10 or $15 more it 
comes with four fans as well item number five is a   power supply and as the name implies it supplies 
power so this is what's going to have a power   plug that plugs into the wall and then it will 
translate your rough and tumble AC power into much   more streamlined and stable DC power at the right 
voltages to provide power to your motherboard   and your graphics card and anything else that 
you might plug into it in terms of specs for a   power supply other than going with a standard ATX 
power supply if you're going with a standard ATX   size case the most important number is going to 
be the wattage and usually that's listed pretty   prominently this is an 850 W unit to determine 
your wattage I recommend to look at the video   card you're getting or the video card you want 
to get and make sure that your power supply has   enough wattage per the recommendation of that GPU 
for most current GPUs you can get by with 750 W   right now if you're going with something slightly 
higherend like a RTX 5080 you'll want 850 W and if   you're going with an RTX 5090 you want 1,000 watts 
minimum fortunately for our needs 750 watts would   be just fine to get us by with a 9070 XT also 
note that this is listing ATX 3.1 and PCIe 5.1   compatibility that means it has a 12V2X6 connector 
that is a smaller but very high power connector   that's used for the latest generation of RTX 40 
series and 50 series graphics cards from Nvidia   that standard has been rife with complaints and 
has a higher failure rate than you would expect   for something uh that's supposed to power GPUs 
that cost $2,000 or more so if you are building an   AMD system the Radeon 9000 series cards and all of 
the older AMD cards do not have 12v2x6 connectors   with very few exceptions so double check the GPU 
that you're buying so if you're building an AMD   Radeon system you do not need to spend more money 
for power supplies that meet this standard and in   fact that is a good way to find some good deals 
now I have gone with a power supply that does   meet that standard we also have an 80 plus gold 
rating for efficiency which is a nice add-on for   a power supply i went with 850 watts instead of 
750 because it was a $2 price difference when I   ordered this last night but that does mean that 
this system will be upgrade ready which is nice   and one of the last cool features for a power 
supply is modularity which means uh the plugs in   the back of the power supply that route over and 
plug into your motherboard and everything else can   be disconnected from the power supply side that 
means you only plug in the cables that you need   and that can help reduce cable clutter but again 
that is not necessary for your PSU so I'm going to   link this one in the description but I'll also put 
a couple other alternatives if you want to shave   off 10 20 or $30 from your build especially if 
you're going with an AMD Radeon graphics card item   number six is storage sometimes we talk about hard 
drives here but honestly these days it's all about   SSDs and those come in two different varieties 
for most builds right now I recommend starting off   with a single two TB NVME SSD this one is a one 
terabyte unit but it does also have a Windows key   on the back which is why I chose it because this 
build actually has a home uh that we have lined   up for it i'm going to tell you more about that in 
a second the M.2 drives which look kind of like a   stick of gum are cool because they're small they 
can reach much higher speeds than say SSDs but   you're also limited to the number of M.2 slots 
on your motherboard and most motherboards are   going to have two or maybe three of those so if 
you're looking for some additional storage a 2.5   in SSD like this one which uses the SATA standard 
is definitely a great way to add some storage   onto your system especially if you're planning on 
installing lots of games just note that these need   to be plugged in separately they have two plugs 
on the back one is for the data that connects to   the motherboard and then the wider one here is 
for power and that connects to the power supply   now you could actually build this system with 
these six components I just listed for around   $650 or so and it would work because the AM5 CPUs 
actually have integrated graphics so you can plug   your monitor into the video out on the back of 
your motherboard's IO and you can get a functional   system up and running it just wouldn't be that 
great at gaming because integrated graphics   aren't very good for 3D rasterization so 
part number seven is a video card or GPU   and the build you should be able to build right 
now but you can't really for around $1,250 would   feature an RX970 XT i'm going to be using the 
Power Color Reaper version of that again should be   $600 i don't recommend spending more than that do 
not pay the current ridiculous prices which are   $150 $200 plus marked up but the nice thing about 
GPUs is they pretty much all use a PCI Express by6   connector which pretty much any modern motherboard 
is going to have so you don't really need to worry   about compatibility there you just need to make 
sure again that your power supply has enough   wattage to power your graphics card and you need 
to make sure that your graphics card fits in your   case which might have to do with the GPU's length 
or might have to do with the number of slots the   GPU takes up or how thick it is but thankfully 
Power Colors Reaper is a standard two slot card   it's not very large so this should fit in most 
standard ATX cases including the Fantex XD Pro so   those are the parts we're building with today and 
this would also be my recommendation for anyone   who's looking to build a really solid middle- of 
the road bang for the buck PC again as soon as the   GPU prices come down but I also wanted to note 
that this system is going to have a home we're   building it for a specific purpose and that is for 
Joe's good friend Laura who he actually games with   on a weekly basis he records those sessions 
and he uploads those to his YouTube channel   so check that out if you are interested but Laura 
has been gaming on a severely underpowered laptop   so this is going to be a huge upgrade for her 
to begin we're going to familiarize ourselves   with our motherboard a little bit more because 
this is where most stuff is going to plug into   right at the center here we have our AM5 socket 
that's where our CPU installs around that we   have mounting for the heat sink fan the four 
slots over here are for our DDR5 memory most   uh fulls size motherboards are going to have four 
slots some will only have two so we're only going   to be using two of these four slots today but 
it does give us the option to install a four   stick kit in the future the lower part of the 
motherboard here is all about expansion and so   here's where you have your PCI Express slots those 
are the longer ones here the top one is reinforced   with metal and that's where your GPU is typically 
going to go further down we have more PCI Express   expansion slots these little short ones are by 
one this one is a BY4 this one is a full length   slot but it's actually only wired up for BY4 
your motherboard manual or your spec sheet is   absolutely going to be your friend in terms of 
determining how many expansion slots you have   down here as well as how they are wired up for 
connectivity whether it's a BY6 slot with full   bandwidth or whether it's a buy 1x4 or by8 that's 
going to have a little bit less bandwidth but   still allow you to install something like a video 
capture card for example and then in between those   slots on this board we have M.2 slots one two and 
actually a third up here that has a heat sink on   it so this is where we can install M.2 drives 
they're held down by a single screw that goes   down on that end the little screws to secure 
that will be included with your motherboard   accessories that is one of the big differences 
from motherboard to motherboard though is how much   expansion you have the motherboard I have linked 
in the description is about $20 cheaper than this   board but it has two M.2 slots instead of three 
that motherboard does however have built-in Wi-Fi   that's one of the slightly more unique features 
of this board is actually one more M.2 slot right   here but it's a short one this is made so you 
could purchase a separate Wi-Fi card to add it   on here and you can even run the antenna from that 
back here to the motherboard IO so you can install   mounting points for your antenna it is nice to 
have a motherboard with built-in Wi-Fi support   by default but it's also really easy to add a USB 
Wi-Fi adapter to pretty much any motherboard that   just plugs into one of your many USB slots on the 
back of the board so if you get a motherboard that   doesn't have Wi-Fi and you need it don't worry 
that's a quick and easy upgrade and then along   the edge of the motherboard typically the bottom 
edge and the side edge you will have a bunch more   connection points for things like your front panel 
audio connectors for your case these little guys   are three pin RGB headers if you want to add some 
RGB bling to your system you have little four pin   connectors like this to connect fans to you have 
USB headers to connect internal devices or you   can use these to enable USB ports on the front 
of your case these are SATA ports or serial ATA   uh you'll often have four or maybe six of these 
there's actually a couple down here on the bottom   edge and then a couple sidefacing ones right here 
that's to provide a data connection for serial   ATA mechanical hard drives and SSDs down here in 
the corner are front panel connectors that will   connect your front panel power and reset button 
as well as the LED if you're lucky your case will   come with a block connector to plug that in but 
sometimes you have to plug in individual leads a   couple more connectors for the front panel of 
your case this is USB 3.0 so it provides more   bandwidth than the USB 2.0 headers and then 
this one is a USB 3.2 Gen 2 this could lead   over to a type-C port on your case and then we 
have power connections for the power supply a   main 24 pin connector over here and then up here 
along the top edge you'll have some supplemental   power that's just for the CPU these are eight pin 
connectors you usually have at least one of these   and sometimes you'll have two for motherboards 
that have a bit beefier power delivery here's   a closer look at some additional fan headers along 
the top edge of the motherboard these are four pin   and the two stacked right next to each other 
here are specifically labeled for the CPU so   that's where we're going to plug in the fans for 
our CPU heat sink and a lot of motherboards will   give you an error message when you try to boot 
them up if you don't have a fan connected to cool   your CPU finally we have our IO along the back so 
this panel will fit through the back of your case   and will give you connectivity externally this 
motherboard has a fixed IO shield so that's this   metal panel that goes around the outside that 
has labels and everything uh some motherboards   especially less expensive ones do not have that 
prefixed which means you need to find this panel   in your accessories and install it into the back 
of your case before you drop in the motherboard   but here's also where you usually have a bunch of 
USB ports often an Ethernet port for a hardwired   connection to your router as well as audio outs 
and then this button over here which allows you   to update the motherboard's BIOS or basic input 
output system without a CPU installed which is   very handy if you are having problems getting 
your system up and running oh and I mentioned   that most AM5 CPUs have integrated graphics so if 
you're running without a discrete graphics card   there is an HDMI out so you can connect a monitor 
we're going to start off by installing our CPU   our heat sink fan our memory and our SSD to get 
our motherboard all set up before we install the   motherboard into the case so let's begin with 
the CPU we pop open the clam shell we're going   to hold the CPU by the sides and the edges this 
metal piece on top is called a heat spreader and   that's going to make contact with your heatsink 
fan in order to help dissipate heat that builds up   on the CPU on the bottom we have contact pads this 
is an LGA CPU so there are pins on the motherboard   and pads on the CPU and you want to make sure that 
you don't touch those pads because you don't want   to get oils on it or anything like that also note 
that there's a notch on the top of the CPU and the   bottom of the CPU that will align with the socket 
and also note that there is a little gold triangle   on one corner so those are going to be your hints 
to make sure you're aligning and installing this   properly if you look at our cover for our socket 
we also have a corner with a triangle i recommend   leaving the socket cover on while you do this 
we're going to take this lever here push down   to the side and release it up that is pressurized 
so you're going to relieve some tension as that   raises and then we can lift up our socket cover 
like so again there's a bunch of pins on that side   on the motherboard and those are very delicate so 
you want to be careful during this stage of the   build process so you don't damage them again 
holding the CPU by the side making sure that   that arrow is lined up with the arrow that's also 
stamped on the very corner of this tray if you can   see that or just reality check that those notches 
on the bottom and top are lining up and we drop   it straight down into the socket i will often 
give it just just a light jiggle to make sure   it's settled down in there and then we can close 
the cover our latch here should catch the other   side of that and as we close it it should pop the 
cover off like that and again it'll take a bit of   pressure to get that arm back under its hook all 
right our CPU is now installed next we're going to   install our heat sink fan and since we have a few 
different versions of this I'm going to cover both   of them if you have a stock heat sink fan like 
this one it will come with some thermal paste   pre-applied to the bottom this has been used and 
I've cleaned the thermal paste off but I'll show   you a picture of one so you can get an idea of 
that don't touch the thermal paste but note that   it is convenient to have that pre-applied because 
it means you don't have to apply thermal paste to   the CPU itself am5 and AM4 motherboards have 
these plastic retention mechanisms on either   side of the socket but funnily enough a lot of 
heatsink fans actually don't use them but some   do so you should get out the instruction manual 
for your heatsink fan double check whether or   not it uses these for our purposes for both this 
Wraith Stealth cooler and the Thermalite one we're installing neither of them actually use these 
retention brackets but they do use the metal   plate that's on the back of the motherboard which 
will sometimes come loose after you remove those   four screws but this one is secured which is 
actually kind of helpful so if you're installing   a stock heat sink fan with pre-applied thermal 
paste it's pretty simple we're just going to   lower it straight down onto the socket aligning 
the four screws with their four screw mounts   i'm going to give each screw a couple turns just 
to get it threaded and then once each screw is   threaded we would tighten them down a little bit 
on each side at a time you don't want to tighten   down one corner before you started to tighten 
the other corners simply because you don't want   to put too much pressure on one corner of the CPU 
and then once that was secured we would take our   plug for the fan right over here to the CPU fan 
header and plug it in you will note that these   four pin plugs have two ridges and those should 
align with the little notch that's on one side   so you can only plug it in one way of course 
we're not using the stock heat sink fan we're   using this thermal right cooler so you'll want to 
get out the manual for that to double check which   components you will need for the installation 
turns out we need these two retention brackets   they're labeled AM4 but AM4 and AM5 CPU mounting 
is the same so that's good and we got four little   red standoffs here and four little screws they've 
also included a splitter here for the fans so we   can plug both fans into the CPU fan header on the 
motherboard some motherboards have dual CPU fan   headers or you can use this if not then we also 
have a tube of thermal paste because aftermarket   coolers often do not come with pre-applied 
thermal paste but they do often come with   a little sticker over the bottom that you'll 
want to remove to make sure that that surface   doesn't have anything in between it so we just 
got two brackets one for each side with a couple screws and then that gives us two mounting 
points with these screws sticking up and   these are pre-installed onto the heat sink so so 
we're going to add thermal paste in a moment but   then it's just going to drop down on top like 
so the idea for thermal paste application is   you want a very thin layer of paste between the 
CPU's heat spreader and the contact plate for   the heatsink fan there are different schools 
of thought on how to do this one is just to   put a blob on the center of the CPU maybe 
a little bit smaller than the size of a P   and we could just drop our heat sink straight 
onto that and that would spread out enough to   functionally work just fine i have a slightly 
different approach and I use a piece of plastic   for that you could use a plastic bag a plastic 
wrap or something wrap it around my finger get   it nice and tight and then I do a bit of 
manual spreading of the paste depending on   the kind of paste you're working with because 
some paste can be pretty thick this may or may   not be an effective method for you but we're 
just starting from the center and spreading   to the outside and again we don't need complete 
coverage cuz the heat spreader sits above the CPU   die or dyes there's actually two or possibly 
three depending on the CPU that you're using   so as long as you have it spread out reasonably 
well the heat and the pressure of the heat sink   on top of it will do the rest of the spreading 
for you after you get the system up and running   that looks good to me so let's mount our heat 
sink just making sure again that we don't have   any plastic there we'll drop this down onto the 
CPU line up our screws and just like I mentioned   with the stock heatsink fan you don't want to 
tighten down one side before the other so get   both of them threaded and then do a couple 
turns on each side until it's all the way tight one thing I should have mentioned before 
installing the heat sink is that it's a good idea   to double check your RAM and clearance uh before 
you install this because it can be a little bit   easier to install the memory first thankfully 
with this setup we do still have enough space   to install our memory even with this installed but 
once I put another fan on top of this the memory   is definitely going to be blocked so here's how 
to install DDR5 memory look at the bottom of the   memory you'll notice the little notch it's not in 
the middle it's a little bit off center so that's   the main thing you got to worry about most memory 
manufacturers will put the label on the side that   faces inside but that is not universal and then 
most motherboards are going to have you install   the memory to the second and fourth slot for 
dual channel memory support those are the slots   that are a little bit further away from the CPU 
socket but again that's not universal so double   check your motherboard's manual to determine 
which slots it wants you to install to first   we're going to take our memory stick align the two 
sides with the notches so it drops straight down   and rests and then we're going to apply firm 
even pressure until it snaps into place it's   pretty satisfying this does take a little bit 
of pressure to get them to snap but as long as   you're pushing down evenly on both sides and you 
have that slot aligned it should pop in no problem   and now our fans for our CPU heatsink fan we have 
two of these one is going to install in between   the two towers like this and then the other one 
actually can go on this side that's where we're   going to mount ours but you could also mount it 
on this side for a pull configuration if you so   desired because these fans have RGB builtin they 
actually have two leads coming off practically   speaking you only need to plug in this one which 
is a standard 4 pin PWM connector for the fans   power but RGB devices will also have a little plug 
like this coming off of it there's 12vt and 5V RGB   headers 5v has become much more prevalent that is 
the threeprong one just remember that they're not   cross-co compatible so don't try to plug a 12vt 
into a 5volt header but for these addressable   RGB LEDs which can change different colors and 
are not just all the same color they'll often   include this which means you can daisy chain so 
first off for installation to make things easier   to plug in I'm going to take our little splitter 
here and plug it into the header that's labeled   CPU fan 1 that is labeled in small text on the 
motherboard but if you want to double check you   can also reference to the motherboard's manual and 
then we have these small wire retention clips that   actually hold the fan to the heat sink these go 
on the four corners they pop around like that and   then this side is going to clip onto a ridge on 
the heat sink here's where you should also double   check your fan orientation fans pull air from one 
side and push it through the other side typically   the side that the brackets on is where the air 
will exhaust some fans have arrows on the side   indicating the fan's rotation and the direction 
of the air flow but this fan does not so I I   guess you got to trust me and the Thermal Right 
instruction manual that we're doing this in the   right way so I got my two clips on either side i'm 
going to rest this up against the heat sink note   that I can't push it down all the way because it's 
actually conflicting with the memory down there   at the bottom but that's okay it's only proud by 
a millimeter or two clips go on the side and one   fan is installed two more clips on our second fan 
which slides down in between and we clip on the   sides in the same way and our heatsink fan our CPU 
and our memory are now all installed oh oh except   for this part our two four pin plugs into our 
splitter and if you do have RGB now is a good time   to plug it in before things get crowded in the 
case we have a three pin addressable header right   here so we're just going to line that with the 
plug to plug one in it's always so easy there we   go then we can pop the cap off for our daisy chain 
to plug in the second one and if you have another   daisy chain sticking out I recommend keeping the 
cap on that to prevent it from shorting lastly   we're going to install our M.2 to NVME SSD but we 
have three slots on the motherboard are they all   the same does it matter which slot we install 
it to the answer there is yes you'll want to   install it to a slot that matches the speed and 
the bandwidth of the SSD that you're installing   the 990 Pro is a PCI Express Gen 4 drive and it 
needs a BY4 connection so if you remember both   our PCI Express slots and our M.2 slots use PCI 
Express lanes if you remember this top slot here   is a BY6 connection so it has 16 lanes we want an 
M.2 slot with four lanes that is Gen 4 compatible   and we can reference our motherboard manual to 
figure that out i like block diagrams because it   shows how stuff's connected we have the processor 
up here we have the chipset here there are some   expansion slots that run through the chipset we 
can actually see that our third M.2 slot here is   a PCIe Gen 4x2 and it's going through the chipset 
which is going to introduce a little bit of   latency so I would want to keep that slot open for 
a drive that's maybe a little bit slower that's   not going to be as missionritical as our operating 
system drive up here we can see that directly from   the processor we have an M.21 and an M.22 the 
upper one is PCIe Gen 5 compatible and the lower   one is Gen 4 compatible and they're both a BY4 
connection since we only need Gen 4 for this drive   I'm going to install it in the second slot that 
will leave our upper slot open in case we ever   do an upgrade and add a Gen 5 drive which will 
make use of that connection and that bandwidth   also some of the PCI Express Gen 5 drives can 
get a little bit warmer which is why there's a   heat sink on this one up here fortunately M.2 NVME 
SSD installation is dead simple as long as you can   locate that teeny tiny little screw that came in 
the accessories the connector is keyed so there's   a little bit of a notch and there's a notch on the 
slot as well so we just install it like so pop and   then we lower down the other side and install our 
little screw you might need a tiny screwdriver for   this part and there are some motherboards that 
have automatic retention clips uh that don't   use a screw down on this side but that varies 
from motherboard to motherboard at this point   I'm going to set up our power supply by plugging 
in the modular cables that we need the modular   cables that we need are for the motherboard our 
main 24 pin power connector as well as two 8pin   power connectors for our CPU note that the CPU 
8pin power block can sometimes split into two   and there are some motherboards that only have 
a four pin connector for additional CPU power   thankfully our CPU plugs are labeled with CPU on 
the CPU side and they also have PSU labeled on the   other side that's the end that you're supposed 
to plug into the power supply now the reason I   specifically call out the CPU 8 pin is because 
there's another 8pin power that's called PCIe   or PCI Express this is the one that we're going to 
plug into our video card and while it's still an 8   pin block PCI Express is usually 6 + 2 versus 4 
+ 4 and then the shape of the actual connectors   there are also keyed so it's very very difficult 
to accidentally plug a CPU connector into a PCIe   slot or vice versa however it is possible so you 
should note that there are two different kinds   of 8 pin plugs and they should be labeled and 
that's how to tell the difference between them   so we have two of those for our two 8pin CPU power 
connectors on the motherboard and then because   our graphics card wisely uses standard 8pin PCI 
Express graphics power connectors instead of the   less reliable 12v2x6 connector we're also going 
to need two of those for supplemental power for   our graphics card note that these have one plug 
on the power supply side and then two daisy chain   connectors on the other end we could plug both 
of these into the graphics card and it would   work probably just fine but if I have the option 
to have a dedicated plug for each connector on the   graphics card I will definitely go with that so 
I'm going to be using both of these cables and we   just won't use the extra daisy chain one we'll 
hang that off and tie it up so we'll just plug   all these in on the power supply side they have 
little snaps you should plug each plug in all the   way until they snap makes a little clicky sound 
like that then these connectors up here are for   both the PCI Express and the CPU since these are 
really just 12vt wire connections two for the CPU   and two for PCI Express for a lot of builds those 
are the only connectors that we will need but in   our build we have a serial ATA SSD so that longer 
connector on this drive does need to plug into the   power supply to provide power this is an L-shaped 
connector the plug has an L-shaped to it as well   so it'll just plug in like so we probably going 
to unplug this and then plug it back in after we   mount the SSD in the case and while we're here 
I might as well show you a serial ATA data cable   that's the other shorter connector there also 
L-shaped serial ATA data cables like this will   come with your motherboard sometimes they have a 
90° connector on one end which can be convenient   depending on the orientation of your motherboard 
connectors or the SSD in your case but again   just make sure you're lining up that L-shaped to 
connect that and it will also often have a little   clasp that snaps into place the other end of this 
routes over to your motherboard and plugs into   one of the serial ATA data headers on that which 
again we're going to unplug and replplug after we   install everything so one last modular connector 
here on the power supply side for our serial ATA   power and then I also recommend checking your 
cases internals because some cases have a fan   controller or something of that nature that also 
needs supplemental power which might have a serial   ATA power plug like this or a slightly older style 
Molex plug like this one fortunately most power   supplies will still ship with at least one cable 
that has this type of connector if you need it   i'm going to skip this next step for the sake of 
brevity in this video but if you're building a new   system for the first time using all new hardware 
it's highly advisable to do an outside of the box   test boot before you actually install everything 
to the case that way if you do happen to have any   defective components which is not common but can 
rarely happen you'll catch it now versus doing all   the installation first and then having to undo a 
bunch of your work if you want a full walkthrough   on that check the link in the description and you 
can look at my previous tutorial but basically it   involves plugging in all the power connectors 
to the motherboard from the power supply you   could optionally install your GPU and route 
power to that as well and plug in a monitor   to that or you could just use the video out on 
your motherboard to connect up a monitor and   all you're really doing is doing an initial boot 
to make sure you get into the BIOS load screen   reality check that all the hardware is being 
recognized and then you can power down and move   on to the next step installing everything into 
the case here's how I recommend unboxing a case   open up the top flip the whole thing upside down 
pull these little handles out so they don't catch   on the internal styrofoam and then lift the box 
off you're almost always going to get a static   shock on this part oh I said almost voila there's 
a few reasons I chose this case one is the price   because it is very aggressively priced and I like 
the fact that there's a couple different versions   so if you want to go with your own fans that 
don't have a bunch of RGB you can do that it   has a tempered glass side panel which is held 
on by thumb screws i do like thumb screws sure   it's available pulsar.net and it's got a very 
standard layout for an ATX case so as I'm making   a tutorial of this video this should align with a 
lot of cases on the market in terms of where the   motherboard sits at the back of the case the power 
supply goes in the bottom and a little basement   area down here that gives you lots of room up 
here for the air to push back and flow through   it's wide enough to accommodate large tall air 
coolers like we're using today it has dust covers   located throughout the case to help prevent it 
from filling with dust and you can pop these off   and clean them from time to time like we always 
do regularly we also have some nice futurelooking   features that uh maybe could be good for upgrades 
or swapping to a different cooler an all-inone   liquid cooler for example is not something that I 
always recommend because it adds a lot of expense   and potential points of failure to a build but 
they do cool better than air coolers so if you're   going for a high core count CPU like a 9950 X3D 
for example you could still accommodate a 240 or   even a 360 radiator at the top of this case it 
even has cutouts at the back of the motherboard   tray for compatibility with some of the newer 
motherboards that have uh the connectors on the   back side of the motherboard instead of the front 
side so a lot of broad compatibility for this case   and again when you have that along with a pretty 
aggressive price that that those are the kinds   of PC parts that I really like to recommend to 
people first thing you'll want to do is remove   the side panels so we can access the interior 
and down here at the bottom we have a box of accessories our case came with a pack of 
accessories some zip ties are very helpful   for cable management in the future and then we 
have screws note that most DIY PCs actually have   two screw thread standards there's the finer 
thread that's here on the right and there is   the rougher or coarser thread that's here on the 
left the ones on the left which look like they   have more of a coarse thread are UNCC 632 which 
is an imperial standard and the one on the right   is M3 which is a metric standard most of the time 
M3 is used for stuff like mounting SSDs whereas   UNCC 632 is more commonly used for mounting 
your power supply but what we're concerned   about right now is the standoffs that ship with 
the case our case has standoffs pre-installed   there are typically nine for a standard ATX 
motherboard but it varies from case to case   whether the standoffs use 632 or M3 the best way 
to verify this is to just check and I have checked   and I verified that our standoffs in this case 
use M3 so to install our motherboard first we   double check that we have nine standoffs installed 
it's also helpful that these are screwed in pretty   tight because you don't want them to unscrew 
if you ever need to unmount your motherboard   sometimes you'll get a little hex nut in the 
accessories and you can use that to tighten any of   these if they're loose the next step would be to 
install your motherboard's IO shield if it has one   if it's not pre-mounted like ours this pops into 
this little rectangle at the back you should flip   it around so it aligns with your motherboard's IO 
try to be careful cuz these cheaper all metal ones   can have sharp edges and I usually recommend using 
the butt end of a screwdriver to pop it into place   of course our motherboard doesn't need this so 
I'm just going to pop it in by hand we should be   careful with our motherboard assembly but do note 
that since the heat sink fan is mounted pretty   securely as long as we're careful we can use that 
as sort of a gripping point and then I'm just   going to lower the motherboard down very carefully 
very slowly shift it over to align the IO and that   little pop there was the motherboard sitting down 
and resting on a couple of these standoffs that   they have which have little ridges that pop up 
that sort of holds it in place so the motherboard   is now where it should be and I can look and see 
that all my screw holes are aligned and after that   we just install our nine mounting screws and for 
these I recommend installing them snugly but don't overtighten all right all screws are 
installed our motherboard is secure   things are looking pretty good here and we now 
have more parts installed into the case than   are still remaining the GPU the power supply and 
the SSD is all that we still need to install for   right now I'm going to do two passes for cable 
management to plug in what's already installed   here our fans have both power and RGB LED 
connectors our case has a bunch of cables   right here that need to get plugged into the 
motherboard after that we'll install our power   supply and storage SSD and get those plugged in 
and then we'll finally do the GPU so here on the   right side of the case is our cable management 
area and another reason I like this case is some   of the cable management is already done for 
you i've pulled all the wiring through to the   back here so we can take a look at what needs to 
be connected every case fan you have installed   in your system is going to have at least one wire 
coming off of it in order to provide power and if   your fan has RGB LEDs it might have a second wire 
coming off of it to control those fan power plugs   look like this you'll typically see them in the 
four pin variety with PWM control they also have   three pin options which are just voltage control 
but either of those should be able to plug into   a header on your motherboard so make sure each 
one of these has a header to plug into on your   motherboard just like you saw me do with the CPU 
fan our three front fans have their RGB LEDs daisy   chained together and those will lead to a three 
pin plug that I'll plug into a corresponding RGB   LED header on the motherboard with our fans 
plugged in we can move on to the case front   panel headers the one on the right here is USB 
3.0 the one on the left is for a USB type-C port   and that is typically USB 3.2 Gen 2 compatible 
which can go up to 10 Gbits per second then you   might also have an eight pin block labeled USB 
that' be for an older USB 2.0 connection finally   we have a couple more eightpin blocks but note 
that these are keyed a little bit differently   and they're also labeled HD audio on the right 
we'll enable the front panel mic and headphone   port on this case although I typically recommend 
plugging into the back port on the motherboard   just cuz it's a little bit less noisy and then on 
the left we have a front panel header this is for   the power button the reset button and the LED if 
you're lucky it will come in a little block like   this and most motherboards are compatible so 
you can just plug it right in in one go but if   you're unlucky you'll have individual pins that 
break out as shown in the manual those need to   be plugged in individually and you can reference 
the manual to see the chart for which goes where   and note that the LED plugs for this connector 
are the only ones that are sensitive to positive   and negative the power and reset button you can 
plug in either way i took the RGB cable from our   CPU heat sink fan through to the back it has an 
open daisy chain connector at the end so I'm just   going to connect our three front panel fans up to 
that and now we should have RGB LEDs alternatively   if you do not like RGB LEDs and you don't want 
them to light up just don't plug this in note   that there is a notch on one side of these plugs 
as you plug them in next we'll install our 2.5 in   SSD there's a rack right here we could mount it 
to but I'm actually going to use this cage down   at the bottom since we don't have any 3.5 in 
drives it's just got a thumb screw holding it   in place this cage can hold two drives on top by 
mounting them from the bottom one there one there i've already got my data cable connected but 
before I drop this in I'm going to connect up   the power as well just cuz it's a little bit 
easier out here and that's dropped back into   the basement the other end of my serial ATA 
data cable needs to plug into the motherboard   those plugs are actually right here along 
the edge of the board and that makes good   use of this 90° connector our power supply is 
going to fit in the other side of our basement   down here and note that we have a fan intake 
we want to position that facing down because   we have ventilation and a dust filter down 
there at the bottom some cases are different   so reality check and make sure you're not 
putting your fan up against a solid wall   but we're just going to shimmy in the power 
supply and then we have four screws to screw   in here note that a couple are at the corners 
and a couple are inset power supplies usually   use UNCC 632 screws but when in doubt just 
use the screws that came with your power supply and for plugging in cables part two 
power supply edition a reminder that we have   a 24 pin main connector for the motherboard 
two eight pin power connectors for the CPU   that are in blocks of four and then two more 
eight pin blocks that are 6 plus2s that will   plug into the graphics card in just a moment it 
can really help to reality check which side the   clasp is on as you'll be bending the wires so that 
that'll line up as you push the wires through and   bend them around to go into their plugs and yes 
these eight pins up in the corner can be pretty tight i fed my PCI Express power cables 
up through the basement this little hole   right here meant for those and now we can 
install our graphics card which is going to   drop into this slot right here this fulllength 
PCI Express slot which will match up with this   edge connector on the GPU which has a little 
cover on it if this little latch is up push   it down to disengage it and then you just want 
to eyeball where your graphics card is going   to go paying attention to the bracket covers 
at the back of the case cuz we're going to   need to remove two of those in order to make 
room for our video cards video outs that's   where you plug in the monitor for this build 
we'll remove the second and third panel cover and you don't need these anymore but I usually 
keep them with the case accessories and then   we'll drop in our video card i've laid the case 
on its side so I can get a nice look straight down   at the edge connector to make sure it's aligning 
with the slot on the motherboard also making sure   I'm aligned here with the rear panel and then 
we should be able to just put a little bit of   pressure straight down oh I'm also making sure 
this bracket's tucked in at the back that's what   was stopping me there then some pressure straight 
down and it gives a nice satisfying snap and the   catch engages down there and here's a pro tip 
while I've got you here if you ever need to remove   your graphics card you will need to disengage that 
latch and I recommend a chopstick for that you can   just catch the edge of it push down that should 
disengage it so you can lift the graphics card   back out to complete installation though we just 
reattach our thumb screws and finally we plug in   our 8 pin PCI Express graphics power connectors 
with the catch on top it is at this point in   the build process that you may do a bit of cable 
management a time-honored process that involves   grabbing some zip ties finding some loose cables 
grouping them up and cinching them down this is   mainly for aesthetics so in particular if you're a 
new builder I would say don't worry too much about   getting everything pristine and pretty but you do 
want to get everything at least tidy enough that   you can put your side panel back on and here's 
another tip for that especially if you have lots   of cables bulging out lay your case on the side 
to put it on and let gravity assist you and now   we have a completed build and again per tradition 
we haven't put the side panel back on yet because   that would show too much hubris and undoubtedly 
our PC would fail to boot but we do now get to   slightly nervously plug in our AC power make sure 
that power supply is switched on and moment of   truth power button over here and the system should 
do that lights fans it appears to be a functional   working gaming PC that we've built today hooray 
now we can put the side panel back on and do this so guys that is how to build a gaming PC in 
2025 and the only thing really holding us back   is the price of the GPU i have a monthly series 
following GPU pricing that I'll be continuing   this month so subscribe for that if you're not 
already and if you just finished building this   system or a system similar to it your next 
steps will be to get Windows set up do some   BIOS settings and I have another video on that 
that I will link in the description that goes   through all of those things step by step but 
that's going to wrap it up for this tutorial   video thank you guys so much for watching 
hit the thumbs up button if you enjoyed   it and maybe consider sharing if you have 
any friends family or other people you're   associated with who are interested in PC 
building cuz it's really not that tough   especially if you have a guide thanks again for 
watching and we'll see you all in the next one",1,The video is a straightforward instructional guide on building a gaming PC

have the build right behind us in the pink colorway rocking a hella Kitty theme does it come in Black it does come in Black last week's build we tackled the $500 price point with Intel's a580 a great value GPU for that $500 build we did today we cover the $600 budget and next week we're going to cover the $1,300 budget that's going to be A14 40p gaming Powerhouse of a build stay tuned for that one if you're new to the channel welcome you are in good hands if you're in the market for a new gaming PC build and you want to do it yourself full beginner guide is what we're going to be doing here today from the discussion of all the parts and how much they cost us building it together I got you guys covered every step of the way and then at the end the fun part we put the build to the test against 25 games Yes you heard correctly 25 games anyways guys let's jump into it to our graphics card of choice the RX 6650 XT you you can compare the performance of this card to an RTX 4060 by Nvidia except the 4060 is like it's almost $100 more expensive than this one so if you want to get an idea of what you're getting here compare it to the RTX 460 it depends on the game though because some games this card will perform better for example in Call of Duty this performs better in Call of Duty than the 4060 kind of crazy right because this card cost almost $100 less than the 460 and this one here in front of us looks beautiful this one's by by Sapphire and it's rocking a full black colorway and it has a beautiful back plate not going to lie we have ourselves a beautiful looking $210 card that takes eight pins of power but this is a great value guys the card speaks for itself the performance and the price that it goes for classic ryzen 5 5600 I call these Classics because they've sold like a million of these they've been around for a while and they're still selling because they provide a lot of performance for the price guys it comes with the stock heat syn so no need to worry about buying additional cooling as far as the upgrade potential of the build because I do want to discuss that now in future build guides the upgrade potential for this this one ranks good with the b550 chipset you can still bump this up to some pretty good am4 CPUs for example the 3D CPU this one right here that's one of my favorite CPUs on am4 for gaming it's great it's a killer in the future you can definitely upgrade to that one and I would definitely consider that CPU future prooof you would be good so back to the motherboard we have ourselves a Micro ATX form factor board it's by MSI this mother board right here is giving us two m.2 slots for our ssds this motherboard does have built-in Wi-Fi that's good and when it gives us good amount of USB ports a 500 GB Western Digital W BL m.2 SSD if you need more capacity up it guys I know games are huge nowadays but we have to stay within budget for the ram we have the 16 GB kit two sticks of 8 GB at 3200 MHz by Pinnacle in the white colorway beautiful Ram it's going to look awesome and we used it in the past $500 build and it did not dis disappoint us the power supply this is a gold rated 650 W power supply by this brand right here that I struggle to pronounce so I will not pronounce it 650 will support future graphics card upgrades but not super beefy ones so if you plan on upgrading to a super beefy one in the future get a 750 W power supply it'll give you more more wiggle room the final part our case this is a Micro ATX case and it is in the pink color way this case also comes in white and black I've never used this case before I'm already getting the first Impressions it looks awesome beautiful colorway on this guy you guys already know I like to see different colors than the norm this one looks awesome guys this build it's going to look super sick it has three pre-installed fans one in the back and two in the front tempered glass side panel and everything inside is pink the whole thing is pink pretty good case guys not bad not bad at all for the price we paid up here we have a power button this button changes the lighting of your fans and the other stuff and that concludes all the essential parts for a total cost of this right here now we're moving on to our second parts list which is completely optional this is only for looks a Funko PP to give a character Hello Kitty our cables in pink and white colorway and our crater AR argb kit I'm really proud of this one cuz it's now available on Amazon Link in the video description guys you pick this up and you leave a good review you're really supporting me and I really appreciate that thank you anyways quick overview W nice sticker man really nice sticker right here high quality water proof pretty dope crater blasting with his rifle we have two strips in this kit flexible bright and strong magnetic attachments the reason why we get this is because it gives us the big splash of light inside our build fully customizable with tons of effects and then that shows off for components anyways guys that is it let's jump into the build guide here we go first we're going to install our CPU into our CPU motherboard socket so when we take a look at our CPU you're going to find a Golden Arrow on the bottom left hand inside of it and when we take a look at our CPU socket on our motherboard you're also going to find an arrow and it's going to be located on the top left side push this lever to the side and lift it all the way up and then line up the Golden Arrow of our CPU with the Golden Arrow on the CPU socket so just hover it over and let it drop right into place just like that you give it a little wiggle it's in return the lever back to its original position next we're going to unscrew these two brackets now let's get out our heat sink and right behind it is our pre-applied thermal paste be sure not to smudge that and now we're going to line up the Four Points of our heat sink with the four points on our motherboard so I'm going to have the AMD text to the left side of me and I'm going to look down here as I'm laying it down to line up all four points correctly as it makes contact with our CPU so now I'm going to screw in one side a little bit just get it to attach good and we're going to secure this heat sink in the next pattern so now get the screw across and secure this one a little bit and we're securing in the next pattern to maintain even pressure and now get these two attached all right now the final one we're going to secure it all the way down and the screwdriver will stop turning it won't let you overtight in it it has a safety on it so simply keep turning till your screwdriver stops [Music] last connect the heat sink fan to the CPU fan header on our motherboard done CPU installed next the installation of our 16 gigs of RAM if we take a close look at our Ram stick you're going to notice how it's indented in the middle we need to line up the indented part with the part on the ram slot that's not indented we're going to be sticking our sticks into the second slot of ram pull both of the levers back and the fourth slot of ram so the ram could run in dual channnel mode then we go ahead and line up the ram where it's indented with the ram slot where it's not indented so we just get it into there and then push down with both thumbs equal force and the ram will go in all the way and both levers will clip back up same thing for our second stick get our Ram into the fourth slot push it down both thumbs equal force done RAM installed next the insulation of our m.2 SSD this little guy is going to go right here we're going to want a zero screwdriver the smaller one going to unscrew both of these remove the heat sink and now we simply plug our m.2 into this slot just like that and then it's going to rest on the standoff right there before we put the cover back on remove the protective film on the back of it now we have our m.2 SSD rest on the sandoff and we put the cover back on and go ahead and hold it down and secure it with the screw but only attach this screw just get it to attach don't tighten it all the way first to get this lined up and now secure this one all the way down and now finish securing the other side cool and there we go we're moving fast guys now we're ready to put our motherboard inside our case so first let's get the front and back panel [Music] off back here we're going to find the bag that has all the screws for the case and when you have your PC case make sure to undo all these metal ties inside of the case cuz the metal in these ties could touch your components and short them so get rid of all the metal ties another thing I like to do on all the cases is removing the hard drive cage because I don't use hard drives anymore hard drives are dying out for desktop use at least ssds are getting larger and they're so much more speedier I don't know I'm curious do you guys still use hard drives go ahead and comment it down below I mean I use hard drives in a Nas server for example but definitely not on my personal rigs now we have more space inside our case for Cable Management so when we install our motherboard inside our case you want to make sure that all of the standoffs inside the case line up with all the points of the motherboard so we need to add three additional standoffs inside the case before we install our motherboard we're going to be using a 5 mm nut driver I'll link this in the video description and we're only going to be installing two motherboard standoffs one right here so I'm just screwing it in and these extra standoffs came with the case of course that were in the case bag and the second one's going to go right here and that's it guys now we're ready to get our IO shield and this thing is going to clip into our case so we line up the io Shield back here and you want to make sure that the three circles are on the bottom side of the case and then you just clip in all four sides and what the io Shield does is it covers up the openings between our motherboard ports so you can hold the motherboard from the heat sink and I'm going to line up the ports of the motherboard with the io Shield so I'm going to get it in here making sure that this fan cable is on top of the motherboard not under it I'm going to line up all the ports with the io Shield good to go and now I lay down the motherboard onto the standoffs and I line up the middle motherboard standoff with the motherboard and it might fall out of place when you can let it go but it's okay we'll hold it in right now with a screw the screws we're going to be using come with the case and it's this one right here so we're going to secure the motherboard with eight screws starting with the middle one right here and then at the end we'll will review all the points we screwed [Music] in all right motherboard secure so three screws on top one here here here all startled red and in the middle of the motherboard another three here here and here and in the final Row one here and here now it's time to install our power supply now before we get our power supply in the case we're going to be hooking up our custom power power supply extension cables we're only going to be plugging in three of them first extension we're plugging in is our big 24 pin power cable extension so originally this would hook up directly to the power supply so instead we're going to hook up the big 24 pin power cable from the power supply to the extension just like that and now on the front of the build this is going to be on display Instead This is how we make our builds pop so that's the first one we're going to be plugging in next we're going to be plugging in a CPU extension how you find it is is you want to locate an a Pin cable that is split 4 + 4 that's how you know it's a CPU power cable and then we're going to hook up the other end of the extension to a cable from our power supply that's labeled CPU and last cable is the graphics card power cable so we're going to want to find a power supply cable that's labeled PCI Express this is what powers our graphics card it's going to have two plugs but for the graphics card we're using the RX 6650 XT it's only going to be using a single a pin and how do you know know it's a graphics card power cable because these split into 6 + 2 instead of the cpu's a pin power cable that splits into 4 + 4 so when we look through our extensions we want to find an a Pin cable that is split 6 plus two and that is a graphics card power cable and we hook it up to the graphics card power cable from the power supply and that's it we're done guys so when installing our power supply make sure that the fan is facing down and we're going to slide it right in here in the back the case and we're going to line it up so it's going to suck in the cold air from the bottom of the case and blow out the hot air through here and we secure it with four screws that came with the power supply and our build is really starting to come along beautiful guys power supply installed all right guys we're almost done now it's time to connect all our cables no need to get intimidated we break down the cables into three groups and take it one cable at a time very simple process first group of cables all are power supply cables from the power supply which powered things and the second group of cables all the case cables from the case that connect our power button our USB ports to the motherboard and then the third and final group of cables is all our fans of the case and the lighting so our first group of cables are power cables first cable we're plugging in is our big 24 pin cable we're going to Route it from the back of the case to the front through here our big 24 pin cable is going to plug in right here guys so this C clip right here is going to clip back here so first we're going to line up our 24 pin up straight get it into the slot and then we're going to push in until it goes in all the way and it Clips just like that it's in all the way and it has clip back here second power cable is our CPU power cable remember the a pin that's split 4+ 4 and we're going to wire this one through the top of the case right here on the far right so the CPU power input is on the top left of our motherboard we want this clip to clip back here so we're going to line it up straight and once we have it in push it in all the way till it clips and there we go moving on to our second group of cables are case cables first cable HD audio so this one we're going to route from underneath the case right here and it's going to connect right here guys at the far left of our motherboard and this cable is labeled with HD audio text right there on it we're going to plug in this cable with the HD audio text facing up this cable only goes in one way so once we get it in push it in all the way line it up straight and push in all the way next case cable is labeled USB and we're going to wire this one through the bottom of the case as well the USB 2 cable could hook up to any of these two USB ports this cable also only goes in one way so the USB text is located on the bottom guys very simple process though if it doesn't go in that means you just have to flip it on over you have it on the wrong side so need to get the correct side in it now we're going to plug in our jfp1 cables right here and that's these little cables right here guys they hook up the power switch of our case and the lights on top of our case to our motherboard and now we wire them to the front of the case first our htd LED cable positive and negative are labeled we flip over this cable and the arrow is the positive side so the positive side of HD LED hooks up into our five pin so it's the second row of pins five and six there we go next this power LED also labeled so the positive is going to be on the left again with the negative on the right go right on top of hcd LED power LED Plus for positive on the first pin power LED minus for negative on the second pin and last one for this case is our power switch this does not matter as far as positive and negative goes you can hook it up anyway into the third and fourth pins on the first row of pits the top row just like that jf1 is complete and now our last case cable is our USB 3 cable if you take a close look at it it has a hump on one of its sides and we're going to wire our usb3 cable through the side of the case right here and it's going to plug in on the bottom right hand side of our motherboard and if we take a closer look there's an opening right here for the hump and for this cable the way we plug it in is we have to first line it up straight head on so we don't bend any pins cuz there's pins in here there we go it's in all pins are connected and now we push in all the way and that is all our case cables we're almost done guys moving on to our third group of cables our fans and our lighting so first we're going to get our fan controller right here and you can go ahead and paste it somewhere on the case when we remove this but we'll do that at the end when we cable manage so first thing we need to do is we need to provide Power to our fan controller it's going to take SATA power so we want to get a SATA power cable from our power supply which is this right here and then you want to connect the SATA power cable from the power supply to the SATA input of the fan control the fan controller now has power next we're going to hook up the three pin AR argb cable from the fan controller to our motherboard this will then let us control the colors of our fans with software on our motherboard so let's turn our case around and we want to look for a three pin argb input and this motherboard has two of them actually which is perfect because that's what we're going to be using both of them on the bottom right of our motherboard so I'm going to Route it under here and it only hooks up one way so we need to line it up correctly we take a look at it there's an arrow that arrow is going to be on the left side right here and there we go it's in very simple the three pre-installed fans inside this case were already hooked up to the fan controller that we just powered and hooked up to the motherboard so all our fans are good to go next we're going to install our RGB LED strip kit the 5vt 3 pin kit argb cool sticker to argb strips an extension cable and the cable that our fan controller had as well a 3 pin AR argb that's how we're going to be hooking up the strips as well so now we're going to look for and there it is guys top right side of our motherboard another three pin input for our argb devices and if we take a close look this pin down here is where we're going to line up the arrow of our argb strips to so the arrow is going to be facing down as we hook it up into AR argb input which is hooked up to our motherboard hooks up to the extension cable and then the extension cable hooks up to the strip so now one strip is hooked up to the motherboard and then it's a daisy chain system so you simply hook up the second strip to the other end of the other strip and there we go they're hooked up to the motherboard now it's just a matter of placing your strips inside the case however you please with the strong magnetic attachments so I'll go ahead and do that for you guys time lapse style so we have one strip right here and then we have one strip along the top of the case and this is going to provide a lot of light inside our case to be able to see our components and it's dope because it's AR argb so there's tons of different lighting effects you can use with these strips and now we're ready for the end the installation of our graphics card the RX 6650 XT by AMD here we go we have to first make room for it by removing the first and second [Music] brackets okay and now inside of here we want to remove the protective sticker on the PCI slot push the lever of the PCI slot all the way back and now we're going to get our RX 6600 XT and we're going to line up our card with the PCI slot head on just line it up straight push it in and get it in there and once you have it in there then you push in straight till it goes in all the way and that lever is going to clip back up and our card is in now and now we secure it with the [Music] screws and finally we hook up our final power cable to our graphics card I'm going to be wiring it from the bottom right here the middle opening on the bottom of the case where I'm getting our eight pin power PCI power cable from and then we plug it in and boom our graphics card has the juice it needs and I'm just going to clean up the cables and there we go guys that looks beautiful but now it's time for the final touches I'm going to Cable manage the back put the Funko Pop in slap on the panels and then we're going to boot it up for the first time [Music] all right guys first budha make sure you flip your power supply on wow you look so perfect I'll hit the crowd if you keep on looking at me like that and you don't know what you me again guys this case comes in white and black and I will go ahead and Link two additional case options that will also be compatible but for panel looks awesome okay so now time for the fun part guys we're going to put this to the build against 25 games and we're going to find out just how well performs for our money time to frag it up Hey listen up and listen up good you're not ready to go just yet you need to install Windows

our best $600 gaming PC for 2025 with the RX 6650 XT and boy was I not disappointed with its performance at 1080p we played all the esport titles at high frame rates it was awesome and paired with an appropriate CPU real world CPU combination the Risin 5 5600 great combo not disappointed and the Aesthetics of our build beautiful now let's talk about upgrade potential first for our CPU the am4 platform offers the ryzen 7 5800 X 3D a great gaming CPU if you're going to upgrade this PC in the future you can definitely go with that CPU it's a great gaming CPU I've used it in previous builds I love it amd's x3d CPUs are amazing for the graphics card well we have a 650 W power supply in here an RX 6650 the XT is already a pretty good card what would you pair it with time will tell yeah know time will tell there's a lot of graphics cards coming out guys by the time you guys upgrade com W tell catch you guys in next week's build $1,300 price point 1440p Powerhouse of a gaming PC continuing

my hands is the brand new 9950 x3d CPU and today we're going to be pairing this with the latest graphics card launch the 970 XT between these two things we're going to create something that's truly awesome and myself included but I think a lot of you guys have been waiting for this because whilst the 9800x 3D is the fastest gaming CPU you can get it's limited to the fact that it's only C and to be clear that's perfect for gaming but if you're someone like me that wants to do a lot of productivity with your chip as well and you don't want to have to compromise between the best productivity performance and the best gaming performance you want the Best of Both Worlds that is exactly what this chip is all about and that is why we're using this in this gaming PC build so what we're going to do here today is grab some of the latest and greatest components this video is proudly sponsored by both AMD and gigabyte but we're also using my favorite case the fantex mv5 and we're going to create something truly beautiful and then of course at the end of the video we're going to show you those all important gameplay Benchmark numbers so you can see just how good the 9950 x3d is when it comes to gaming with a 970 XT and I think it's fair to say in that we're all agree that this has been a little bit of a weird year so far when it comes to launches there has been quite a lot of exciting stuff but a fair bit as disappointed let's just say that but this was easily the most exciting launch of the Year for me the 1970 XT and I must admit this was almost a little bit of a sleeper because I saw these cards at CES and I kind of underestimated them a little bit and then AMD came out of nowhere and really impressed us with the $599 price point for this now obviously that is the starting MSRP so as we've seen prices can creep up especially if you go for like a high-end card and some etails at the moment uh let's just say not charging what I would expect but there will be more stock coming in and hopefully we can maintain very good pricing on this so This actually is the gigabyte gaming OC so this is supposed to be as close to MSRP as possible editor Carl has actually been using this one for our benchmarks I wouldn't say that this is a particularly Crazy Design it's not the most out there thing in the world but ultimately it's practical it still looks good and it's going to give you all the gaming performance that you need while staying relatively cool and quiet I mean we've got this triple fan setup here I think you've got a little bit of RGB and then you do have three eight pin power connections as well so there are actually going to be some of these cards that will use the 12 or 16 pin power connection but I know a lot of you guys going to prefer the eight pin so this well this well this may well be the way that you want to go so it's an attractive graphics card and the thing for me as well with this generation is not only have they massively improved the rage racing capabilities of these but actually the thing for me that has probably impressed me the most have been FSR 4 technology this is upscaling and it works really really well don't worry we'll be showing you this towards the end of the video but again if you want to see our full independent testing then you can find that in the top round corner of your screen but as I say today we are definitely upping the anti considerably last time we used a ryzen 9700 X which was an 8 core non x3d chip so this 16 cores with x3d is going to be even better by a considerable margin obviously depends on the game and the workload and what's bottlenecking your system but yes if you want the best of the best is almost certainly going to be this when it comes to productivity and gaming on the same machine and if you're unfamiliar x3d essentially works by having some extra cash on the CPU itself which means that it can help in latency bound applications which games quite often are so we'll be putting this through its Paces but obviously the first thing we need to do is actually get our system built and we're pretty much going for very high end it should go without saying if you're just looking to build the best value gaming PC obviously there are going to be far cheaper ways of doing it but if you want all of the performance and you want all of the features then obviously this is what we're doing here today and the exact motherboard that we have here is this one which is the x870 aurus master obviously this is from gigabytes and massive shout out as well but if you do want to go for an all white rig they've got so many ice boards just literally Google ARS ice motherboard and it'll come up with all the results and a lot of those aren't even that expensive as well which is great obviously the board we have here though is black and gray and it's got so many features most notably really the fact that we have P generation 5 on this top slot we also have a total of three m.2 generation 5 slots as well if you want to go for super fast storage this top one as well has this massive heat sink which is definitely going to help with thermal transfer because these especially generation 5 drives can get very very toasty and very warm we got loads of AIO including 5 gig ethernet but then the USB ports as well because this is x870 are very very quick not only do you have a lot of them but they're rapid so if this is going to be of use to you then fantastic should support overclocking on the memory to a higher speed than you got with the previous generation so it's very complete and as things are hotting up in here quite literally I think it is time to actually get our build started sh so we put our motherboard on top of the box and then we will pick up our brand new chip and I must say that I am very very intrigued as to what the actual performance of this is going to be like is the 9800 x3d still going to be even faster is this going to be quicker is it going to be game dependent this actually has a slightly faster boost clock it goes up to 5.7 but then it has a slightly lower base clock than the 9800 x3d but obviously with these new boards as well a lot of them will come with gaming modes so the default way essentially is when you're playing a game it uses the windows game mod game bar Windows game bar functionality to identify what a game is and then it Parks the eight cores on the CCD that don't have that extra cash this means that you don't need to fiddle around with motherboard settings and in theory depending on the application that you're using it should just work but if you want to like overclock your chip to the absolute Max and you don't mind kind of just having a couple of different modes in your bias one for gaming one for work then you could potentially get even better performance if you go down that route and you wouldn't have to rely on provisioning services and things but it's great that you get the flexibility now as far as our memory or our Ram is concerned AMD made the same mistake twice they sent out for our testing this which is a g skill Trident Z5 ddr5 kit c28 6,000 MHz fantastic but it's a uh it's a white Kit so we we can't put that in our rig that would be insulting to the build that we're doing so instead we're trading it slightly for some Corsair Vengeance RGB this is C30 not c28 still 6,000 MHz but fundamentally this is also 48 GB which actually kind of makes more sense in this rig because again this is supposed to be hybrid productivity come gaming and whilst 32 gig is more than you need for a gaming PC unless you're like running mods or you want to do 8K gaming with mods 32 is almost certainly going to be fine but 48 obviously depending on your workload especially if you're doing video editing or working with AI or something like that then obviously it is going to come in handy and then it means you can double it up at a later date and then you can get 96 GB of RAM rather than being limited to 64 without swapping out the sticks but then ladies and gentlemen rather interestingly we're finally using something new and the SSD I think a lot of us were waiting for has arrived I mean you know not waiting by the doorstep for the parcel to arrive but it is still exciting in its own right because finally we have a p generation 5 SSD from Samsung I don't quite understand the name it's called the 9100 Pro I guess they ran out of numbers when it got to 990 995 wouldn't have sounded quite as good but then again this is the 950x oh no so I don't know what Samsung on about there but this is a PCI 5 SSD so even faster read and write speeds again for gaming not really going to make a massive difference apart from very like select scenarios but obviously for productivity and for future proofing you can't really argue with this but you will need a heat sink for it so if you don't have one they do also sell a variant that has a heat sink baked in and to be honest this is potentially going to be better for people cuz your warranty will obviously cover the fact that it's got a heat sink whereas if you didn't have sufficient cooling then you might run into problems buy the right one for you oh and actually this looks tallest look yes huge heat sink take off the peel do the same with the bottom and then yes as if by Magic you can grab your SSD and if you don't have a double-sided heat sink on your motherboard this is definitely one I'd recommend going for the preheat synced one but then you can just drop that down into position but now that our motherboard base station is complete it is of course time to actually move on and get this installed inside our chassis and I love this thing if you haven't already seen it my personal rig is actually using a fantex mv5 it's the first generation version this is actually the slightly revised new one obviously this is in Black my personal is in white but I absolutely love this because the build quality on this is just second to none this genuinely is my favorite casee on the market it won my case of the year last year and it's so solidly built you can often get this for under1 in the UK now the compromise is you will have to add your own fans so that's what we're going to do a little bit later but I don't really think that matters especially at this level because what was happening is they' include cheap fans people would throw them away and was just a bit of ewaste I get it for cheaper builds but if you're going for something a bit higher end bit more premium it kind of is nice to have the choice you can put fans down the bottom side top and here at the back we do have a little bit of RGB vein as well that can turn on when you actually turn your your rigon now being nitpicky the only thing I don't really like about it is it's actually quite difficult to pick up and move because there's not really many good places to grip it and if you hold it here at the back you've kind of got this plastic that has a bit of a edge to it as you can see though there is ample room here for cable management you can put like ssds and things on this and just tuck them out the way neatly which is quite cool let's grab our box of goodies that is actually quite literally a box of goodies and then actually we can point out the main revision that they've done with this Mark I version which is just that it supports reverse connection motherboard so if you wanted to go for like a project stealth board put it in here and then obviously you can connect it around the back and have even better cable management but let's drop our case down on our desk and before I get a massive thank you by the way to overclockers UK who did actually Supply this and then we can grab our board and then we can line this up fit our board down once that's in place let's grab and feed through all of our front panel connections consisting of USBC power switch on the front panel USB 3.2 is down the bottom then we have our addressable RGB and our front panel audio and now that that's in place I want to take this opportunity to actually use our fans and the ones that we're going for here are probably the best all rounders to be honest these are from Le and Lee these are the unian SL wirelesses so Wireless refers to the communication obviously you still need to plug this into the board but it is literally just one cable or in the case of the LCD ones that we're going to be using two cables per block and that's it all we need to do look is literally just line them up and lock them together we do this with all three we're add our little communication bit on and then these should literally just line up in this little hole and then just fit it down into place then just plug in your fan speed and then your USB for control I'm also going to add an extra fan at the back and this is part of the starter pack as well so we will actually get all of the gobbins and bits that we need but these are actually not the LCDs these are just the standard ones let's plop this one here at the back then actually as we have a spare it doesn't look quite as good cuz you should have the reverse plade but it's going to be fine so we can actually add this one down here at the bottom so I have dropped that one into place we just have one cable to run through but I will say that there was a kind of electrical contact here that was really annoying me so I've just put a bit of black electrical tape really good thing to have around the house by the way uh over this just so you can't see that anymore otherwise it looks pretty good this is what the wireless receiver looks like by the way it is just a USB drive or it looks like a USB drive that you put in the back of your system or if you prefer to have it inside then it does also come with an adapter so you can do it that way as well just plugs into your system over USB happy days but now that that fiddly bit is at the way it's time to move on to sometimes another fiddly bit this being our CPU Cooler this one is pretty good actually it's the a waterf force 2360 we've used this a couple of times on the channel and I don't want to say it's no frills cuz it's definitely not a cheap product but it kind of has everything that you need without going over the top it's not got like a massive LCD on it but then you don't have to pay for that if you just want a good caller that is hopefully going to keep our chip under check this is not a bad one for the money so let's take this out of our box and then oh yeah then you can remember why you really like this it's because you also have interconnecting fans just like the ones we're adding third party which does make this so much easier look at that boom less screws and less cables so let's get this fitted down then we can literally just line this up with the top and then use the screws to secure it home at this stage if you haven't already you will need to remove the default am5 Mount and I'm showing you why I usually do this first not because it's the end of the world but because you have these little screws that kind of like pop out and you sometimes they go in the bits of the motherboard and get in the way then you can add your a standoffs to the mix add a decent chunk of thermal compound to the middle then you can pick up your pump head and just lay this over the top and then secure into place with the nuts and then the final piece of the puzzle for the cooler is just to plug in the cables for both the fan and the pump speed and the RGB and now that we have got all of those in place we've done a little bit of cable management you can see it really is starting to come alive you do also have this little GPU sag bracket here if you're wondering what that is by the way and that is a great segue into usually I say the most exciting bit of our rig but today it's equally with of course that brand new CPU on 9070 XT let's remove slots two and three and we just want to line this up look with the slot and then it should just be guided into place naturally little bit of force before screw it into position safe and secure and then once you've done that you can move on to the final piece of the puzzle the power supply and we are over specking this a little bit with a c1200 which of course is a 1200 W unit but realistically again we're going for high-end if you want to overclock this especially G CPU and CPU you're still not really going to get close to the maximum but it's nice to have a little bit of head room in hand especially if you are going to swap out the graphics card in the future for something that uses even more power this one of course is rated gold for efficiency and it is fully modular let's plug in all of our connections and hang on a second whoa whoa whoa I usually I'd you know fast forward this bit and we'd get to the exciting bit but this is interesting I don't like this look this is a 1200 watt unit as say NXT gold but when we actually put any tension on this cable at all you can see these are nice and slack but look at this that gets really tall I don't know if this is just like I don't want to say dodgy unit but this is a potentially flawed unit let's say but I don't like that at all cuz if you put a lot of tension that's not what you want on your power supply so I'm going to link a different one down below regardless of which one you do use though it should just be a case of sloting this down at the bottom and getting it screwed in running the power cables to their respective positions then just plug in the ATX then you've got the really fiddly bit which is the two eight pin CPUs at the top left and then of course last but certainly not least we have our GPU power connections oh and I'll tell you what ladies and gentlemen the big pile of Parts just fell on the floor we are now all set up and hopefully ready to go but I think this looks pretty good I mean there is a little bit of bulk here I think that's fair to say that's not the absolute best custom cables definitely would help but otherwise I'm really liking the look of this I can't wait to get this turned on and all the screens to be illuminated software installed so we can actually get some temps or some gifts or something on this and just to show you around the side you can see cable management is very good on this granted we've not got like a crazy amount of stuff but because we have 38 pins there's a little bit more than usual but it's able to handle it with ease we could use these straps if we wanted to but like that is fine to be honest let's grab ourselves a little monitor shall we oh whoa whoa whoa I've literally just plugged this in and it's turned itself on which is unusual but interesting I was going to say let's grab ourselves a keyboard on Mouse and build up to it but we're here something to note if you are using these lean Le fans if you plug them into the motherboard you do have to usually set them to full speed in the Bios otherwise you can get some flashing it depends on the brand of motherboard and what's being sent by default cuz all you're sending is power not actually the fan speed so bear this in mind and then you'll like calibrate it all in the software but otherwise it's just a case of waiting for it to boot our lights have come on look there's all of our RGB we're missing a little bit at the top actually I think there's probably a SAT I didn't plug in but that's okay the fans are spinning oh yes there we are bias baby let's start by turning on our Expo or XMP profile for our memory then we go to smart fan and then we'll make our L Le run at full speed and then this is that mode that I talked about earlier if you're just going to use this for gaming for a while no productivity you can turn on x3d turbo mode that turns off the CCD that doesn't have the cash in it or at least the extra cash in it and then you can get even better performance in certain games but personally speaking I would probably just leave it in the default mode and let all of the provision vising service and all of the AMD chipset drivers do their job and so then ladies and gentlemen through the power of a SATA connection cuz that was actually the problem we are now all set up and ready to go and I will say that the system looks absolutely stunning I've synced everything together to be nice and blue I think you can actually plug the addressable RGB into one of the like that controller that goes around the back as well so if you did want to syn everything together through the LLY software you can do that which is nice I forgot that when we were doing that but as you can see everything's blue so it doesn't really matter the software still a bit buggy which is annoying some of the LCDs didn't actually show up they weren't controllable but after restarting it it seems to have miraculously fixed itself which is good but not as good as it potentially could be but I want to start by jumping into some games and the first thing really that I wanted to test is again FSR 4 because I think this is possibly the best thing about this launch bar maybe the extra performance and better price performance and things that you get because evsr was definitely worth using before but the difference in IM quality between FSR 3.1 and 4 is pretty astounding and a lot of this is just down to the fact that this AI upscaler actually runs using new hardware that's baked onto the GPU itself and it just gives you much better image quality so what you're seeing here is actually 4K but we are upscaling this with FSR 4 I think we're running this at performance and indeed we are and the way that you actually get this if it's not native to the game if you're running uh FSR 3.1 title you go into the driver you enable the FSR 4 override and then you can get get it working in older games but I'm sure a lot of them will eventually be updated to FSR 4 like Call of Duty war zone for instance is but yes that's how we have it running and as you can see in terms of frame rate we're currently getting around about 120 FPS but if we kind of slow the camera down a little bit just so you can see it is a really really detailed image this is a 4K OLED monitor that we've got here and it is absolutely ridiculous just how good this looks I'm sure a lot of you will wonder what happens if we turn the settings up a little bit so if we go and change this to Quality is that going to make that much difference to our frame rate not actually as much as I would have expected we're looking at around about 103 106 FPS now and obviously you are getting even better image quality but to be honest whil it is going to be noticeable if you're pixel peeping I think for most people that are just going to like enjoy the game personally speaking I would optimize it for frame rate between these three settings because they're not as I say night and day whereas before you definitely could notice between performance balanc and quality whereas now it's a lot more nuanced than differences which is pretty cool but yes in Horizon a game that looks absolutely stunning you're looking anywhere really between about 90 and 130 FPS at 4K depending on the FSR settings you're using and this also running at the very high preset I should add so this is no mean feet to be able to do this it's very very impressive as I say though this is not just a system that is all about gaming this is also about productivity so let us know actually in the comments what sort of tests you want us to do when it comes to productivity because we will be giving all of these C ever to editor Carl to actually do a lot of like in-depth testing to see how it performs at both games and productivity but to give you a taste of the performance just while saying that you can see cinebench has completed or at least has done the first run I was really confused there for a second but it's because we had our 10-minute thermal throttling test enabled but we've run it again and we've got a score of 41599 I'm sure we could actually get a little bit better than that we do have a few other services and things running on this for the RGB and yeah on a 9800 x3d you're looking about 23,000 that is a massive difference so if you're doing any sort of productivity work anything that can properly utilize those cuse and as I say in games where you're going to be doing Shader caching and things before the game starts that is going to speed up pretty considerably oh but ladies and gentlemen I can actually go full nerd for you here which even for me is quite something because what you're seeing now is Spider-Man Mars Morales and this is a game that has FSR 4 it's running ridiculously well actually we have this set to 4K FSR is performance rate tracing is set to high everything else very high preset we're getting bloody 200 FPS 200 FPS in a rate Trace title how about that on a 240 HZ display but that's not the demo what I wanted to show you we will actually obviously have a look at the gameplay in just a second about essentially how this core parking works it's not going to be like this in every single game it kind of depends on the workload essentially but if if you want to know that it's working properly just open up your task manager and here you can see we have our 16 in core processor and we've got a couple of cores that are doing background task but then you can clearly see the game itself is using the eight cores that actually have that extra cash on it and this just essentially makes sure you're getting the best possible performance and it does it without you having to do anything just make sure you do have the windows game bar up todate enabled and that it knows what you're playing as a game and the chipset Drive is installed that bits key but whilst toss manager is editor Carl's favorite game personally I prefer to actually play something like this which is still Miles Morales and as you can see once we start swinging around our frame rate does drop a little bit we're looking around about 140 to 160 FPS but again that is still pretty remarkable bear in mind we're outputting at 4K with the help of FSR 4 and we do have our rate tracing enabled so if we actually find a window you'll see that these Reflections are actually now coming through on the Windows obviously it does depend on the exact settings and things that you're going for but it definitely can be quite effective especially if you're going to play a game like cyber Punk or something it kind of varies depending on the game that you're playing but personally I think Spider-Man's not a bad one especially uh when you do have this much extra resource if you like in the tank I mean bear in mind this is not a 2,000 graphics card and you can get 180 FPS in Mars Morales at 4K with FSR and rate racing disabled disabled rate racing enabled like come on what more do you need but ladies and gentlemen as you know there is more to life than single player games because where it's really at is multiplayer and the one you guys know I love to play at the moment is fortnite last week ranked no build I actually got my first CR round Victory Royale which I was very very proud about and I celebrated by buying a skin cuz I'm cool but despite my questionable life decisions what you see here is fortnite outputting at 4K we're using TSR to get there uh we've got a combination of quality and high for that settings there's two I know it's slightly confusing but then in terms of the actual settings itself obviously as I say we're outputting at 4K uh but textures are at very high view distance is at very high everything else is at high this I think is the way I choose to play and if you had a capable system like this it's probably the way I don't want to say you should play but this is going to be a great balance between getting all of that visual goodness and still getting a very high frame rate and as you can clearly see we're getting around about 180 to 190 FPS and the game looks absolutely fantastic also looks great on OLED monitor as well definitely if you are going to like go for the full battle station it is worth the investment trust me especially bear in mind that when you move the camera around as well when you have this level of frame rate you don't get much motion blur and you really can see what's going on but as you can clearly see we are definitely in have your cake and eat it territory with a frame rate this high and obviously not having to choose between well a high frame rate and also high resolution gaming you can do both so very very pleased with this and 97% or so on the GPU utilization we're not running into any CPU bottlenecking so fortnite is running great and wow okay I wasn't actually expecting that but I thought we'd test this at 4 and 40p as well we've got the exact same setting so the same upscaling you can notice that the image isn't quite as sharp but to be honest it still looks very very good unreal 5 definitely does a good job with the inbuilt upscaling as well but you can see the frame rate has quite literally gone through the roof we're now looking at 260 FPS and we are now just just starting to hit the limits I think of the CPU our GPU utilization is around about 94% you can see there uh but it depends where you go on the game we are getting this weird bug as well this has nothing to do with the PC just in fortnite where Godzilla does slide around I've also bought this emote as well cuz I'm super cool don't judge me okay okay it's money well spent and actually because this is a pretty high load on both the GPU and the CPU this is probably quite a good time to do our noise test shame I died didn't it but very very impressive it does make more noise than if you were to use like a lesser CPU I mean I think that's obvious at the moment we're pulling around about 100 Watts or so on the processor so not like a crazy amount not the full 170 uh that you're going to be using if you're well rendering anything or pretty much H hammering that CPU hard but of course we should show you those temperatures as well so the one at the top left hand corner is our GPU temp of 61° Hotpot is 80 so both very very good very low but we do have great ventilation in this system and then as far as the CPU is concerned in our gaming load we're looking around about 65° or so but again when you start hammering this depending on how much your fans are designed or been tuned I should say to ramp up you are probably looking around about 90° or so if you're like hitting it sustained 100% for a long period of time so bear this in mind but obviously you can tune your fans accordingly and do you see what I mean I mean probably not cuz you're only just seeing this but usually it takes ages and ages to do all of the Shader pre-compiling in war zone that happened so much faster than all the other systems I've used recently that is the benefit of having 16 cores but sure we get into the game so indeed then ladies and Gentlemen let's jump into a game and actually show you exactly what this machine is made of so once again we're outputting at 4K and we're actually using FSR to get there once again uh We've set this to Quality at the moment but obviously you can turn this down to Performance if you want to get the best possible performance and it's actually using a surprising amount of ram this is why we say 16 gig is just not enough these days uh cuz we're allocating 23 and a half which is interesting interestingly as well look we are actually allocating over 15 GB of vram very very interesting that's why obviously having 16 gig is very useful because if you are going to be playing at high resolutions especially at high settings as well it is going to eat into vram especially if you're going to turn things like R tracing and stuff on unfortunately I've let the side down actually and uh and died but we're going to the goolag but I want to try this at 1440p as well just to show the difference quick quick we don't have time for this it's going to be game over and as you can clearly see oh the frame rate has increase quite dramatically actually we're hitting 200 FPS there in certain areas but generally speaking you're now looking about 180 190 and in terms of the settings as where we were using for this it was the ultra preset which annoys me cuz there's an extreme which is even better than this uh but we did turn the textures up which is probably why uh we're using a fair bit more vram so yes I don't know about you but I find that pretty impressive as I saying quite a CPU bound game to be able to get near 200 FPS is not a mean feet whatsoever but I'd love to hear your thoughts on this what do you make of our system would you go for the 9800 x3d the 8 core or would you step up to the full fat 16 and then obviously have the best of both worlds really it is going to cost you make no mistake it's not a cheap product compared to the 8 core that is definitely going to give you uh the best bang for the buck when it comes to like proper hind gaming but as you can see if you just want a complete system that can quite literally do pretty much anything then I don't know about you but I think we found it and it looks absolutely stunning and beautiful as well I kind of like this blue color that we've got going on here but as I say I'd love to hear your thoughts on this so what do you make of the rig what do you make of the GPU the CPU and which x3d would you go for or do you just stick with a normal chip we' love to hear your thoughts on this smash the like button though if you've enjoyed this get yourself subscribed and as always if you do want to check out current pricing on anything that was

And hey, look what finally bloody showed up. The Google Pixel 9a. Took its sweet time, but better late than never. And you can actually snuffle your own right now for just $499 British quids. $559 or $499 if you're living over in Trumpland. You poor bugger. Let's get some of that delicious co light down here. That'll make everything better. But what's the deal with the Pixel 9a? What's actually changed versus the old Pixel 8 and is it worth your cash? Well, my full Pixel 9a review is coming soon. But for now, here's an early squint at the camera tech, the gaming chops, all that good stuff. And for more on the latest and greatest tech, please do poke subscribe and ding that notifications bell. Cheers. Okay, so first things first, what do you get stuffed inside that lovely box? Well, naturally, you've got yourself one Pixel 9a. You've got a smashing safety warranty and regulatory guide. You've got a pokey SIM pin. And you've got yourself the usual type-C to type-C USB charging cable. That's absolutely everything you'll find packed in the box. Okay, so here it is, ladies and gents. The fresh new Google Pixel 9A, which has now grown to a 6.3 in smartphone compared with the old Pixel 8, which was just 6.1 in. But the actual dimensions haven't increased that much. Thankfully, and that's because the bezels have slightly slimmed down, at least for this generation. As you can see, there were proper chungsters on the old Pixel 8. As you can see, certainly down below, it's noticeably dinkier now. Although, hey, let's be real here. Calling these bezels slender would be overly generous cuz yeah, they're still about as thick as Kanye West. And the Pixel 9 itself is still quite chunky as you can see there. Although also reasonably lightweight compared with a lot of modern smartphones. According to Google, it's 185.9 g precisely. Didn't want to just round up to 186. Then certainly one of the more compact smartphones of 2025, although that finish is less rounded compared with the old Pixel 8. You've now got a completely flat front and back as well as flat edges. whereas the old Pixel 8 certainly had a more curvy design. Now, mercifully, Google hasn't sharpened up the corners at all. The overall handfield, not quite as good as the 8A. A bit more porky, has to be said, but reasonably comfortable to clutch. But, of course, one of the biggest changes for the Pixel 9a is the all new camera bump, or pretty much complete lack of it. I got to say, I was a big fan of that Pixel camera strip. So, it looks kind of weird on the Pixel 9 having that amputated. It's possibly one of those designs that'll just take a wee bit of time to warm up to, but for now, nah, not great in it. Although, on the plus side, still no wobble when this phone is flat on its back, just like the old 80. That's because the new camera bump literally sticks out of that back end about a millimeter, if that. As for what it's made of, well, that display is once again Gorilla Glass 3, the same as the Pixel 8. Was kind of hoping they would finally upgrade to some fresher version of Gorilla Glass, but a 7i or something like that. And then running around the edge, it's a 100% recycled aluminum frame. And then you got yourself a plucky back as usual. 81% recycled plastics apparently as Google with it. Very precise figures again. And even though it's plastic, it still feels good. Nice and smooth to the touch. And you got this matte finish of course. So hopefully won't get smudgy, greasy, and grimy. Now, Google is offering the Pixel 9a in a couple of poppy punchy colors, including this here sort of purpley blue effort, which is known as iris. Otherwise, you can also grab it in a pinky hue, which is known as p peony. The bloody word I can never say properly. Hang on, I might as well get bloody Google to say it. Pe otherwise, if you're not a fan of brighter colors, you can snuffle the Pixel 9 in black or white. otherwise known as obsidian and porcelain. And the Pixel 9a are IP68 rated versus the old IP67 rating of the Pixel 8a. So they can be submerged in water for slightly longer and at slightly greater depth. Now I don't think anyone will be particularly shocked to hear that it is of course the latest freshest Android 15 running on the Pixel 9a complete with the reassurance of 7 years of OS updates and security patching shenanigans. The phone is protected as usual with an indisplay optical fingerprint sensor. Quite nicely and comfortably positioned. It's not like right down here at the bottom of the display like it is on some smartphones. And so far, Touch One absolutely fine just like the Pixel 8. Pleasingly responsive as long as your mitts aren't too grubby or moist. You've also got a bit of face unlock support in backup as well, which can unlock straight to your desktops. And this can be used with your banking apps and other secure bits. And as usual, Pixel 9a absolutely packed to the tits with all kinds of great privacy and security features. You got that Titan M2 security chip packed in there, same as the Pixel 8 to securely and confidentially store away your biometrics and other sensitive bits. Got the usual refined selection of customization tools for tweaking the lock screen and your home screen, getting them looking just the way you like them. And an excellent bunch of safety features as well, including the likes of car crash detection. and you got those crisis alerts. As for the storage, well, it's 128 gigs of this stuff, unless you want to hoy even more cash Google's way for the 256 gig model. Kind of a shame that 256 gigs isn't standard as that is certainly becoming more the thing in mid-range mobiles. And of course, as usual, absolutely bugger all micro SD memory card support. Fact, you've only got space in that SIM tray for a single SIM card. Although the good news is, as usual, you've got a good bit of eim action on the Pixel 9a, just like the 8a before it. Great news if you're buggering off abroad to somewhere that's not covered by your mobile contract. Just grab yourself a cheapy eim before you saw off and then that'll do you the whole time. And now kitties, it's time for the part of the video that'll have approximately 90% of viewers frantically stabbing the skip button. We're going to bang on about AI. So, naturally, you've got all the usual Google's smarty pants bollocks, including a good bit of Gemini action. Although, Google isn't merily gifting you a full free year of Gemini advanced action when you purchase a Pixel 9. You'll have to upgrade to the Pixel 9 flagship for that. And quite a few of the other standard Google AI features are packed on here, including good old circle to search, of course. But unfortunately, one of my absolute favorites from the Pixel 9 series, the screenshots app, has not migrated down to the Pixel 9a. And that is a massive shame because I genuinely found it very helpful indeed. It was perfect for remembering stuff if you've got a piss poor memory, possibly thanks to alcohol related reasons. But some of the other cracking new features like theft protection have thankfully made it to the Pixel 9a. And of course, you got stuff like Pixel Studio, which I mostly find completely pointless, unless you got a serious thing for dragons because it seems to be particularly good at drawn dragons. As usual, one of the most impressive and genuinely useful AI tools is the photo editing shenanigans. So, you can, for instance, erase other human beings out of existence. If only it was this easy in real life. Anyway, more on that side of things in a bit. And Android 15 can be a little bit buggy here on the Pixel 9. So far, it's been mostly well behaved, but see if you can spot what's wrong with the notifications panel. Rebooting the smartphone twice did absolutely nothing to correct it. But thankfully, when I started mcking around with the UI colors, that brought it back to life. Now, the Pixel 9 rocks that slightly larger, but still reasonably dinky 6.3 in actual display. It's PLE tech. You got full 24bit color reproduction and HD your 10 streaming support in the likes of Netflix. So yeah, as usual, stunning contrast. You got deep blacks, crispy whites. You can clearly see what's going on even in quite murky scenes in your favorite teley show. There's a 2424x 1080 pixel resolution delivering 422.2 pixels per inch. And seriously, Google, you need to calm it with these stats, mate. Just round up. It's fine. And that peak brightness has been boosted as well compared with the older Pixel 8 to A. So it now hits around 2700 nits at its peak. Went outside and tested them while wearing shades in bright sunlight and had no problems with the visibility, seeing what I was doing, replying to messages, etc. And as usual, refresh rate maxes out at 120 Hz. What did you expect? It's not a bloody iPhone. It's also not LTPO tech, however. So, it doesn't scale all the way down to one hertz when just using the always on display, etc. And there was no mention of PWM dimming, so if you are sensitive to OLED flicker in lower light conditions, you might want to try before you buy. Now, you got a decent beefy pair of stereo speakers slapped on the Pixel 9 as well, which is perfect for enjoying a bit of Netflix or whatever without to slap on the old headphones. Let's just max out that volume and test it out. Happy Friday, kiddies. Your uncle spurt is back to give you a proper dose of the clap. Consumer launches and products. That is, as well as a proper full-on face full of herpes. That one's not an acronym, by the way. That's just herpes. Could certainly use a bit more bass, but the top volume certainly impressive, especially for a smartphone on the smaller side. And touch word, no issues with the Bluetooth shenanigans so far either. Now, the Pixel 9a is powered by Google's latest Tensor G4 chipset, which also is stuffed inside of the rest of the Pixel 9 family, except here you've just got the 8 gigs of RAM. And as you'd hope, the everyday running here on the Pixel 9, nice and silky smooth. Flipping between apps is an instant process. Those animations nice and creamy as well. However, when it comes to gaming, the tensor chipset certainly not as strong as some rivals in that department. With more intensive fair like Genchin Impact and Withering Waves, you will see frequent performance drops. And so far, spend a good couple of hours gaming on Withering Waves. And that frame rate did drop quite frequently from 60 frames per second down to more sort of 20 to 30 frames pers range, especially when things got a little bit heated. I had various big gribbly things trying to munch my face off. And wing is still perfectly playable, just not as smooth and enjoyable experience as you will get on some more capable rivals. And of course, if all you want to do is blast through a good bit of Call of Duty or PUBG or something like that, well, no worries. Those titles are heavily optimized for all kinds of different smartphones, so you should get a beautifully smooth experience on those. And the good news is that even after well over an hour of non-stop weather and weird action, this smartphone was only getting slightly warm. There were no issues there in terms of performance throttling or anything. In other words, not much of an improvement for the Pixel 9 when it comes to raw power versus the old Pixel 8. And apparently Google has stuffed the older 5300 modem into the Pixel 9 rather than the fresher 5400 which it's got in the rest of the Pixel 9 series. But will this have an impact on the connectivity? Well, sadly, you'll have to wait for my full in-depth Pixel 9 review for more on that side of things. I'll stick my SIM in here, spend a good week or so with it, and see if the connections a little bit patchy when I'm roaming out and about. Of course, you got full 5G support naturally, but it's just sub6 5G certainly here in the UK. And it's Wi-Fi 6E on here as well, not the latest Wi-Fi 7. Now, one area where the Pixel 9a really has been improved over the Pixel 8 is the battery capacity. It's been boosted to 5,100 mAh for the Pixel 9a. It's not far off big buggers like the Xiaomi 15 and a big jump over the 4,500ish miamp of the Pixel 8. And so far, in my limited time with the Pixel 9, that battery life has been sublime. Certainly a mere trickle whenever I've just been playing around with the messenger apps, streaming video, streaming audio, yada yada. The only thing that's been sapping it faster is of course a bit of camera action and when I was playing weather and waves that cause it a drop. But again, stay tuned for that full final frank review for more on the battery side of things. And when you do need to recharge the Pixel 9, slightly faster charging than the Pixel 8. It's been boosted from 18 watts up to, I believe it's 23 watt on here. Now, Google claims that is fast wired charging. I would disagree, frankly, considering a lot of mid-range phones support 60, 70, 80 watt wired charging. It's going to take a wee while to juice it back up. We do have wireless charging support as well. It's chi1 sadly, not chi 2, so it's stuck at like 7.5 watt, slower than a one-legged sloth where that one leg has been nailed to the bloody floor. Oh, and there's no battery share feature here on the Pixel 9 either. So, if you do have wireless charging accessories like a smartwatch or earbuds or whatever, you can't just bung them on the back of this thing and juice them up on the move. So, let's conclude this lovely Pixel 9 unboxing and hands-on review with a squint at the old camera tech. And what you've got on here is a 48meg quad PD shooter with optical image stabilization which appears to be the same tech as was packed into the Pixel 9 Pro Fold that's backed by a 13 megapixel ultra wideangle shooter. Now of course there's no telephoto shooter on here just as with the regular Pixel 9 but you do get up to eight times super res zoom as Google calls it. And fair play Google's image processing produces some reasonably crispy pics when you are maxed out at eight time zoom. Well, for the first time on an A series Google smartphone, you've also got a bit of macro action. Still don't really see the point, but if you're into your macro shots, there you go. And apparently the Pixel 9 is rather good at the astrophotography shenanigans. You want to shoot pictures of the stars in the sky. So, here in London, all three of them. And does anyone actually still care about astrophotography? I get the feeling it kind of hit its peak around COVID time when that was all we could shoot pictures of, the bloody moon. that and of course the three or four people that we were stuck in the same bloody house with every single day sharing a living hell. And besides that macro shenanigans, you've also got the ad me feature here on the Pixel 9a, which you didn't have on the Pixel 8. Just allows you to swap places with whoever you're shooting a photo with and get yourself in that photo artificially. So, it looks like you're all having a lovely little family moment. and it's early days, but it's just a small selection of some of the pics sped out by the Pixel 9a. Certainly impressive stuff so far. As usual, that image processing is working hard, but produces quite natural looking photos overall. Not overly bright or saturated like with some rivals. And again, more than capable in low light scenarios, too, producing quite finely detailed pics with rich colors. But I am looking forward to fully testing out the Pixel 9a for my in-depth review. And then for your video type shenanigans, you can shoot up to 4K resolution footage. There's no 8K upscaling option or anything like that here. Can boost the frame rate up to 60 frames per second if you like. And again, the 9A certainly seems up to the job, but stay tuned for that full review for my thoughts on how good it is at capturing home movies. And then up front on the Pixel 9, you've got yourself a 13 megapixel selfie shooter, which again can capture 4K resolution home movies. is the stabilization seems pretty good. You've got a dual mic setup which does a respectable job of picking up your voice. So again, certainly seems absolutely fine for your simple vlogging efforts, bit of skyping, not skyping for much longer actually, Zooms and Teams and whatever. A lot of video chat type stuff. And there you have it, my lovelies. That in a tasty wee nutshell is the fresh new Google Pixel 9A. Just a quick squint at some of the best bits ahead of my in-depth review, which hopefully should be dropping in about a week or two. As you can see, a few we upgrades over the Pixel 8. One of the biggest being the battery capacity boost. The fact you've got that Tensson G4 chipset stuffed in there as well. Not much of a boost for the old gaming shenanigans, but it does mean hooray, you've got more AI goodness squeezed into the Pixel 9 versus the 8. A few other we tweaks here and there as well. And of course, the usual reassurance of seven full years of Android OS updates and Pixel drops. But what do you reckon? Are you tempted by the Pixel 9? Perhaps you've already had yours delivered. It' be great to hear your thoughts down in the comments below. Please do poke subscribe and ding that notifications bell for more on the latest and greatest tech and have yourselves a ruddy wonderful rest of the week. Cheers everybody. Love you.

OVC5fVd_IybrowUpWq1SrqT0gPg,The Best Wireless Gaming Headsets in 2025,This is the ultimate guide to the best wireless gaming headsets available in 2025. We'll look at long term ownership for the Arctis ...,BadSeed Tech,2025-03-05T15:15:03Z,"{'default': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uv2EsVct-8I/default.jpg', 'width': 120, 'height': 90}, 'medium':

360}}",,Uv2EsVct-8I,1559,175495,en,Uv2EsVct-8I,we had some pretty noteworthy wireless gaming headset releases last year and thinking about how I wanted to package this video today going into 2025 I think I'm going to take a king of the hill approach the product review so we're going to revisit a couple headsets that I think currently hold the crown for different reasons we'll talk about the long-term ownership experience and any updated Impressions and we'll look at some more recent competition from Asus Rog Alienware Razer and by surprisingly popular demand the Astro A50 to see if any of these new releases unseat my current picks we'll talk about FPS gaming performance and single player gaming because I've seen a lot of comments that single player is a market that feels underserved than YouTube reviews in general if an audio product is good for FPS it's also going to be good for single player but there's one major difference between sound profiles aimed at competitive stuff versus a more immersive gaming experience and that's bass assuming the product has a good level of detail as long as you can add that bass back in without making the overall presentation sound poor it's going to do great for single player as well but not every gaming headset can pull that off I have to point out too that these Wireless Flagship systems are expensive and wireless is primarily geared for convenience and features not necessarily audio quality and definitely not mic quality if Wireless isn't a big deal to you you can get a fk1 d amp and a 50ish pair of iems you'll be in for a little over $200 it'll sound great and it'll serve you well for years with modern wireless tech latency isn't really a concern these days but wired is still winning for Pure sound quality for those of you that enjoy Wireless Freedom like to always have a mic at the ready game on multiple systems and enjoy having some audio mixing features built in let's get into it so coming into this video with the top of 20 2 my two main picks for like the past year have been the odsy Maxwell and the Arcus Nova Pro Wireless from steel series The Maxwell for Pure sound quality and the Arcus Nova Pro Wireless because even now this still leads the league in feature set and thanks to a recent Pat upgrade from Joe over gadgetry Tech this is primarily what I've been using for gaming over the past few months my personal copy is actually a first gen that I've had in rotation since my original review of this unit way back in July of 2022 so I've had this exact set for almost 2 and 1/2 years now and nothing feels loose or worn out or anything still really light at 355 G and very comfortable for a variety of head sizes even my very large head I've done some embarrassingly long camo grind sessions in these on the newer versions of these the active noise cancelling Nubs inside the ear cups are a lot smaller now and the ear pads themselves are thicker and a lot more plush than the first versions I'm not a big fan of the steel series GG software I find it can be pretty buggy and it does crash on me sometimes but the sonar software is amazing for eqing it's got a full parametric EQ and they have a ton of presets for popular games or you can just click to load custom eqs like the one Joe uses for his patch this uses a base station with a nice big volume knob on the front and you can access just about everything you need in Hardware including the volume limiter if you find these don't get loud enough for you this also uses sonar to handle game to chat mix so you can assign your chat driver to like Discord or your music app and control the mix between that and your main audio you can do that either on the Bass Station itself or by clicking the volume wheel on the actual headset this also has simultaneous Bluetooth which means you can hear the game signal and the Bluetooth audio mixed at the same time the base station also has 3.5 mm Au in and out meaning you can use this system wirelessly with with like a go XLR I believe this is still the only system on the market you can do that with there's an additional 3.5 mm auxin on the headset itself so you can still use this wired with any device that uses Ox out we've also got the infinite dual battery system here where One battery is in the headset itself and the other one is in the base station charging so you can just swap these out whenever you need to and you don't need to even power down the headset to do that the low Point here is definitely the mic it's still better than the Maxwell in my opinion it is a really small capsule luckily you do have some EQ options in sonar if you want to shape how this sounds and I do like the idea that it's retract able not removable so I never have to go hunt it down it's just really mid for the price and do be aware that there are no secondary beam form mics here so if you are going to take a call with these you are going to need to have this mic out while these are great for gaming these are not what I reach for if I'm going to listen to music these are passable if you're a music casual but if you're into audio at all chances are pretty high that these aren't going to cut it for you these have okay Channel magic these are measurements of the left and right Channel and the closer these lines are to each other the easier it is to pick out the direction that sounds are coming from this factor is hugely important for FPS gaming and obviously if these didn't work well in that regard I would just use something else for my collection so solid detail and solid directional cues make these a beast for FPS you can't EQ the Bas up with these too and you don't have to worry about loss of detail so these do provide a solid single player gaming experience too the game World feels very spacious in these so these come out to be a very complete package for gaming and they include active noise cancellation the downside is that the mic is obviously pretty mid these originally retailed for $3.49 but they've been in market for so long now that you can occasionally find these as low as like 260 and that is a steal for what you're getting here there are two vers versions of this and like most gaming audio products the Xbox version fully supports the PlayStation but the PlayStation version does not support chat on the Xbox so Choose Wisely thanks to an update on these back in September of 23 you can use the preset eqs and one custom sonar EQ on the console side too if even the sale price is a little too steep on these the arctis 5 and 7 also exist both without a base station the five specifically uses a mobile app that allows for an insane amount of EQ presets on the console side and sounds better than what you'd expect for the price if you don't really like the headset for Mad Steel Series has also released some game buds recently that we'll talk about toward the end of the video the Maxwell at 299 or 329 is what you get when you have an audio company designed gaming product Maxwell is an audio quality first everything else second type of experience it's definitely not without its quirks and some pretty weird feature implementation and when I say audio quality first I mean this is one of the very few headsets to gain the respect of both gaming peripheral reviewers and audio file reviewers but to be a great gaming headset you really have to have the right intersection of sound quality comfort and feature set these came a really long way from odsy previous offerings but they've been in market for just a little over 2 years now and we've learned some things these are planar magnetic headphones that means they use a completely different driver technology than the dynamic drivers that we see in most headphones it's like a very thin diaphragm sandwiched in between magnets and it seems like you have to be more careful with these than you do Dynamic driver headphones so no slamming these down on the desk and no pushing these in towards your head when you're wearing them or you risk damaging that driver like the arctis I'm still on my original set of Maxwells these have seen countless hours by now and I haven't had any issues with these at all the first weird thing about these is the way they handle Bluetooth it's not simultaneous and you can't manually switch between sources it's all automatic if you're connected via Bluetooth to your phone it prioritizes Bluetooth so it stops your game audio switches over to do whatever your phone was going to do and then switches back to your game audio which can be really annoying if you're just trying to game they have rolled out numerous firmware since this came out but each one is an adventure in fixing something that needed fixing but introducing new issues at the same time like I don't even have the latest firmware on these because I hear it messes with the tun and they removed the ability to roll back firmwares a couple firmwares ago so I don't want to risk it the good thing is the desktop software on PC works really well for me these days and this headset has physical controls on here to access literally anything you need to the only reason you need to go into the software is to design a custom EQ using the software app on the phone over Bluetooth still feels really buggy to me even today so again we've got a situation where the mic is the low point on the Maxwell possibly the lowest on the list today this does have some background AI noise cancellation baked in which unfortunately degrades the overall quality of the vocal but you have to have this on running at least low because if you don't it cuts the levels of the actual vocal down really bad so you're kind of locked into using this for whatever reason this mic is really susceptible to breath noises both from your mouth and your nose and it's really finicky with positioning it's crazy to me that with all the options on the market we have a tendency to either get a good mic or good sound and not very often do we get both at the same time there is side tone here so you can hear yourself back in your own headset sounds really good with the boom mic there's no lag here at all but the big thing with the Maxwell is that if you're not running the boom mic you have to turn side tone off otherwise it's going to pull audio in from those onboard mics it's going to make the entire audio sound terrible so for the times that you're not running a mic just make sure side tone is off outside of that this is easily one of the heaviest gaming headsets on the market at just under 500 G with the mic but it's designed in such a way that it doesn't really feel heavy on the head and I've used these for hours at a time I also really like the stock cushions here I know a lot of people like to upgrade these I find these to be really high quality and really comfortable so I guess the best way to think about the Maxwell is if you want something that will work for all of your wirel listening needs even for those of you with a more Discerning ear for audio the Maxwell is still the king for me in that regard you are giving up some features though there is game to chat mix here but there's no active noise cancellation there's no simultaneous Bluetooth and the mic is mid for sure if you already have a wired solution at your desk that you primarily use for music listening you might be better served with a more gaming focused Wireless set that has all the important features for you and these have been in market for a while so unless that price point just doesn't phase you if you haven't picked these up already it might be worth waiting and out to see if there's a V2 coming soon so we're now on Gen 5 of the Astro A50 I've owned a few of these over the years and I've never done a proper review on them because honestly I've just never been that impressed by these I had a gen 3 that had terrible connection issues with my PS4 and I just kind of stopped paying attention after that the sound quality wasn't really that impressive to me I thought they were really overpriced for what they were I thought they definitely coasted on their brand name and I felt like they appealed mainly to console Gamers so that makes these gen fivs the most surprising entry on the list today because these are just very good it's a really complete package and it executes almost everything you'd want out of a gaming headset to a very high degree the X version I have here today is 349 the standard version is $299 the big difference on the X version is the HDMI 2.1 pass through this does both 24-bit audio and video so your consoles plug into the base station and then out to your TV and there are no HDMI cables included here that and the X version adds chat mix support on the PlayStation side both versions function identically on the PC so if you don't need the HDMI pass through you can save yourself 50 bucks and still get everything that's great about these the base station has connections for both consoles and a PC so you can have all three sources hooked up and then toggle between them with a dedicated button on the headset every other system I've seen out there tops out at two simultaneous connections and this doubles as a charger for the headset when it's not in use like everything on the list today you get Dolby Atmos support here you also have G customization for when you're on Console you get game chat mix and simultaneous Bluetooth not a big fan of glossy plastic but the onhe head controls here are really good it's not too heavy at 366 G it's really comfortable for long sessions and these rotates you can wear this around your neck the only features it lacks are a 3 5 mm auxin it's not on the headset and it's not on the base station so this is 100% Wireless and there's no active noise cancelling and these ear pads don't do a great job of passive noise cancellation they are really plush and really comfortable they've been the same design for a really long time they just pop on and off real easy with magnets the only thing to be aware of is that the internal opening is real small so your ears don't go inside here they sit more on your ears that is something to be aware of if you're sensitive to that so the mic on the Astro is one of these flip up to mute flip down to go live designs I do wish this hinge was a little more substantial because when you have this flipped in the up position this can flop all over the place like Johnny sends after a tough shift and you really have to be careful that you have this thing all the way up to make sure you're muted that said this is one of the best sounding most natural mics I've heard on a wireless headset there's a couple presets for the mic EQ that are really straightforward too and they're presented graphically so you immediately know what they're doing you have the default which is the strongest performer for me then you have broadcast which emphasizes the lowend and competition which emphasizes the high end I don't have any complaints here about the quality of this mic I'm really impressed by this there's three basic EQ settings the default one I find to be a little too base heavy for competitive but that's literally just one EQ click away you can also bring in eqs from other users or pros and there's custom EQ in here if you want to tweak your own and that holds true on the mobile app side too for console use overall I'm really impressed with this if active noise cancellation is not a big deal for you it is really tight between this and the Arcus Nova Pro Wireless active noise cancellation is the major difference but the mic quality is also much better than the Arcus doesn't have hot SWAT batteries but it does have 24 hours of battery life and is always charging on the dock when you're not using it so battery life should really never be an issue especially if console or home theater is a big part of your gaming equation I think this is the way to go coming in at the offensive price point of $399.99 is the Razer Kraken V4 Pro and it really begs the question why is this a $400 headset when we look at the standard Kraken V4 at 17990 which sounds and feels identical we really need to understand what justifies the pro version costing over twice as much the first thing is simultaneous Bluetooth which you don't get on the standard version I was really concerned that this was like a firmware lock so they just put that feature behind a pay wall I did confirm with the engineers that there is a separate chip in here that allows for that that's not present on the standard version next is that we have a base station here it has USBC connections for your PC and one console and there's a 3.5 mm input here that's an interesting choice this lacks a 3.5 mm out so you're not going to be using this with a go XLR or anything similar and there is no 3.5 mm aux on the headset itself which means if you're running a wired Source you're going to be wiring to the base station not the headset which is kind of odd and there's no battery charging system here like we see on the arctis so this is basically just a fancy breakout box for controlling features that has an OLED screen the main feature though of the pro is the Sensa HD haptics which basically means you're going to get vibrations in your ear cups to highlight certain events on screen now if you really want to do this up this pairs with their freay of chair cushion and distributes that haptic feedback all the way from your head down to your Kula Freya cost another $300 so that's $700 total if you want the full haptic experience now to be fair when this is done well it really is quite an experience but that's rare what I mean is there's currently only 10 games that really make full use of the haptics and five of those have only been added in the past few weeks there's loads of games coming soon but those have been coming soon since I initially checked out this setup last August and it's almost March now for everything else you rely on a more generic interpretation and razor provided suggested settings for a pretty big list of games sometimes it adds real depth to the experience like survival horror games are great other times like Black Ops 6 it's just pure chaos something or other is vibrating nearly the entire time it just gets exhausting the htic system is deep there's tons of controls here if you want to try to tweak a title that you play a lot if this is something that appeals to you as is great but this feels like a pretty big buyin at this time based on the amount of titles that currently have full integration of Sensi HD the mic here is small and retractable like we saw on the arctis but I do think this sounds better than the arctis you will need synaps installed to make the most of this you're hearing this on all default settings with the broadcast preset which is how it ships this also has side tone which sounds really good and there's no lag here either I don't generally think too much of the mic enhancements that we see in synaps but the one that really stuck out to me here was the volume leveling where you can get really loud on this thing and it preserves that level at a listenable volume but you can also get really quiet and it still keeps that at a pretty consistent level I should point out too that this is using the latest firmware that just came out on the 26th of February the one that came out earlier in the month was supposed to improve the mic quality so you're hearing this at its best right now Razer says they're using the same mic technology in the Kraken V4 Pro that they used in the black shark V2 Pro 2023 Edition this is one of if not the best sounding mics in all of wireless headsets the issue is that the capsule itself on the kraken's mic has to be smaller in order to fit that retractable design so you're hearing the black shark V2 Pro also on that broadcast preset and not only is there a huge difference in the size of the mic capsules there's a huge difference in the sound quality that I'm sure you can hear for yourself I think especially at this price point users would have wanted this quality of mic in a detachable version versus sacrificing that quality to fit that retractable Design This does feel heavy on the head at 393 G and you have to be careful to get it situated just right otherwise you get some clamping Force right behind the ears this is not one of the more comfortable headsets for me I'm good for about an hour in this thing these pads really seal in the heat too normally we see this style of pad when a headphone has active noise cancellation but at a price point of essentially $400 there is no A&C on this unit and that's pretty rough as for the sound it's decent you really need to EQ these to get the most out of them and sadly the three included eqs for movies music and gaming are really holding this unit back not just for music but for gaming too the gaming EQ especially designed to be an FPS EQ is really fatiguing for me I think the sound here would be ible at $180 but it just doesn't fly at 400 bucks so look this is probably the best built razor audio product I've ever seen and the design here is gorgeous the lighting looks insane but I can't believe that the person who's spending $400 on a headset is really going to prioritize elaborate RGB for me this is wildly overpriced and still manages to miss in a couple key areas so unless you're super into haptic feedback there are plenty of better ways to spend your money on wireless Auto coming in at 229 we've got the Asus Rog Delta 2 Wireless the first thing that got my attention with these is how light they are at 317 G with the mic attach this is top five one of the most comfortable headsets I've ever worn this actually gets way too large for my head which is not something I'm used to seeing so you might want to be careful if you've got a pretty small head personally I can wear this thing infinitely I'm talking hours and hours no issue so You' got 2.4 wireless Bluetooth 5.2 and 3.5 mm AUX input on the headset itself it is simultaneous Bluetooth and the controls here are super smart the volume for 2.4 is on the back of the the left Cup and the volume for Bluetooth is on the right makes it really easy to mix sources and you've got separate track controls on each side call controls on one side mic mute and RGB on and off on the other really great layout this can use their Armory crate gear for a lightweight peripheral specific install or the full fat version of Armory crate if you're running other Asus stuff in your system like I am the only reason to run it is to access the EQ presets which are pretty deep and there's a base boost function here that's actually kind of nuts outside of Maxwell I don't think I've heard a headset put up this much base and not distorted that's not say you have to use it all the time but it's there when you want it and these just sound really good overall the only thing I found about the EQ and the Basse boost modes is that they are tied to the PC side of only so you're not going to have those available if you're running these on Console or using them just for Bluetooth the other thing you may run into if you're using the EQ presets and Armory crate is that most of these have simulated surround sound enabled by default turn this off it can negatively affect your perception of both distance and Direction and I found the flat gaming preset to be better than the FPS preset the mic on the Delta 2 sounds really natural to me too this was really surprising it easily outclass is both the Maxwell and the arst this does have side tone but it only pops up in a game that supports chat or an app that supports recording otherwise it's just not on at all unlike some of R's earlier offerings this sounds really good and it is presented completely LaGree the only thing I wish for with this and hopefully it's not something I overlooked but I would like a hardware control on the headset to toggle side tone on and off because even when you mute the mic side tone is still active there are some mic EQ options inside Armory crate but I honestly think default sounds best you still get good top-end Clarity and you get some warmth in the tone tone that really helps to capture the base in your voice without sounding too stuffy you're actually hearing this now on a system that doesn't have Armory crate installed at all these include two sets of ear pads in the box so you get the fake leather which is going to give you a deeper bass response and slightly better passive noise isolation but they run a little hotter and you get a pair of breathable mesh pads that have slightly less bass and they run a little cooler these swap pretty easy and I really like the shape of these at 229 you wouldn't expect these to have all the features of a flagship and they don't they don't have a dedicated chat driver on the PC for game chat mix even though you can just Bluetooth your phone for both Discord or music music and these don't have active noise cancellation with the software being tied to the PC you won't have any EQ options on the console side but that said these do work great on the PS5 on the Xbox side you'll need to run these wired right into the controller I got a lot of static and just overall was not a good experience so there's a lot to like here provided you're primarily on the PC the mic is solid sound is solid it's insanely comfortable the battery life's pretty nuts with 24 hours on 2.4 with the lighting on or 110 hours with it off the only thing for me is that at 229 it does feel like you're paying the Asus tax with missing some of the more notable features like game to chat mix and active noise cancellation these would be a lot more competitive at 179 189 if the Delta 2 is one of the most comfortable headsets I've ever used the alien wear Pro Wireless is the most comfortable headset I've ever used it's only 314 G with the mic similar headband style but the pad and the CBS are this absolutely buttery fake leather with like a really low density foam it's like putting little pillows on your face the MSRP on these is $229.99 but I see these down a lot to $199.99 there's no RGB here so so battery life is 35 hours with active noise cancellation or 75 hours with it off that's pretty nuts the hardware controls are pretty sparse on these there's just volume a mic mute an active noise cancellation toggle and then a toggle for Bluetooth or 2.4 so strike one there's no simultaneous Bluetooth on these another weird thing I noticed is that we do have both a game and a chat driver in Windows the issue is that there's no Hardware control for it anywhere on the headset and there's no control Fort in the software either so you can assign a different app like Discord or your music app to that secondary driver but you'd have to use a third part software like sonar to leverage that so effectively I have to call that no game to chat mix the mic here is unfortunately very mid this sounds a lot closer to the Arcus than it does to some of the other nicer mics we've heard today there actually is a decent tone here it's just the fact that this thing is so cluttered with transmission and compression artifacts it really takes away in the Alienware control center which is probably my least favorite Control software due to bugs and overall sluggish Behavior we do have the option to turn on or off their dual mic AI noise cancellation sadly whether this is on or off doesn't seem to make any major improvements to the vocal quality itself we have S tone here which like the Delta 2 is active only when you're in a game or an app but unlike the Delta 2 it's very subpar here it's not particularly clear and it doesn't get very loud so I'm just not a big fan of this mic and unfortunately there's not a lot else here for me in terms of a total package proposition that would make me overlook this the sound itself is actually really enjoyable on these right out of the box which is good because there are no EQ presets not even in the software literally no way to EQ these without using a third party software most gaming headsets particularly from from steel series have so many EQ presets it's almost pointless to measure these but I had to know what made these sound so good not surprisingly it's a more exaggerated Harmon curve with higher base response this is that classic v-shape big lows big highs low meds if you've watched my Channel at all you know that's pretty much my favorite tuning and also very close to how chical Tunes most of his collab items the only thing you can do in the software is adjust the active noise cancellation which I did want to talk about because it does affect the tuning on these you get a little more base punch and an even deeper scoop in the upper mids these both sound good so just pick which one sounds best to you in game so unfortunately there's not really a lot to dig into because the cons outweigh the pros here for me Pros are battery life active noise cancellation overall sound and these are insanely comfortable unfortunately the mic is pretty mid the feature set is lacking physical controls are pretty poor software support is very poor and there's no Bluetooth mixing here these again work great with PS5 not with Xbox there's not even an AUX to take advantage of for the controller I know these were developed in conjunction with Team Liquid to be more of an Esports focused product but outside of a andc the feature set here is really limited for the price all right so of the units that we've looked at so far today here's the breakdown for me razor a skip unless you really enjoy haptics the alien wear feels like a skip period it's got great bones good potential for a V2 but it doesn't feel fully fleshed out yet the r Delta 2 is a touch overpriced in my opinion but it's a really strong Contender without going up to that $300 Mark I do think Maxwell still sets the bar for people with a really Discerning ear that don't need active noise cancellation and aren't concerned with simultaneous Bluetooth the mic though is still pretty mid for those of you with a more casual ear who put a little more emphasis on the mic I think the Rog Delta 2 will serve you fine for a lot less money the arctus versus the Astro is where things get interesting the Astro wins in mic for sure a battery Situation off all the time the Arcus Nova Pro is still the only setup that works completely integrated with the go XLR setup the Astro X has best-in-class home theater routing the Arcus still works well with wired sources the Astro is 100% Wireless only it's a tough call but I think the answer is that if you need to go XLR support Andor active noise cancellation go Arcus otherwise go Astro all right honorable mentions today starting with the Turtle Beach Stealth Pro I liked this headset a lot because it did one thing exceptionally well and that was directional Imaging in FPS games specifically Call of Duty but after a while I just found myself going back to the arc this Nova Pro Wireless both for comfort and for feature set and once Joe dropped the custom pads for the Arcus Nova Pro Wireless it was just kind of game over for the Stealth Pro this also was the only Turtle Beach product I'd ever used that didn't have that like endcap it Target like Turtle Beach feel to it I got their Atlas Air in shortly after and that definitely felt like a return to that lower tier build quality and their initial firmware made stuff like the volume wheel on the side feel really janky for some reason luckily they've got that smoothed out now thanks to some firmware updates I was really excited for these because they're open back and you just don't usually see that in a wireless gaming headset Unfortunately they don't really give me the same spacious feel that I get out of my higher-end open back audio file headphones and I still got a lot of the negatives like they leak sound like crazy so that's definitely something to be aware of with these Pros are they're really dialed in for FPS the mic sounds great they're really comfortable and they have dual driver game and chat mix the downside is that there's obviously no active noise cancellation because that really wouldn't make a lot of sense in an open back there is no simultaneous Bluetooth mixing and the overall build quality here it just doesn't really Inspire confidence even after the firware updates I would probably skip these at their full asking price of 180 but if you could find these closer to like 140 these would be a good pickup if they meet your needs as for the Corsair virtuoso Max I have reviewed that thoroughly already I will link that right up here but at their price of $329.99 Flagship money they fell pretty short for me and lastly today one that was pretty surprising for me these are the arctis game buds from steel series these are essentially like a true Wireless earbud that also happen to have 2.4 Wireless for gaming regardless of what they look like I've never been the type to wear a gaming headset out and about in public but I actually would with these they've got a solid amount of onhe head controls and the outsides are actually tactile buttons not a touch sensor so you don't get any missed inputs you just have to go a little light so you don't Jam these into your ear canals I know these aren't the first product of their kind in Market but they are the first ones I've heard and I was actually surprised at how good these sound they're somewhat comparable to the Sony XM 5e buds that I wear to the gym the detail is there but the bass response isn't quite there on these and the active noise cancellation isn't quite as good I wasn't able to try any alternate tips on these because the nozzles here are the smallest I've ever seen on any product which is good to know if you've been burned before by IMS that have really thick nozzles these do sound a little warm in they stock tune but you get the benefit of all the different EQ presets that steel Series has here you can use these either on the desktop or the mobile app and they save to the buds themselves I do find if you're at the desk these work best if you have a dedicated media control on your keyboard or elsewhere on your desktop because adjusting the volume on these can be a little tricky and the mics are understandably poor versus a solution with an actual boom mic but there is side tone here so you do get active noise cancellation there is no Bluetooth mixing and as long as you're not super dependent on a mic these don't feel like a bad pickup to me at 160 especially if you're able to leverage them both as a lifestyle product and a gaming product damn that was a big video today let me know in the comments if there's a specific headset that you want me to take a look at otherwise I'll probably come back in a couple months and do another one of these but more geared towards the budget end that's it for today thank you so much for watching and until next time stay up,1,The video transcript provided is a detailed review of various wireless gaming headsets available in 2025

It's ETA Prime back here again. Today we're going to be putting together a lowerc cost small form factor gaming PC that's capable of playing AAA games at 1440p. And with something like this, you're not going to break the bank. We're not going to be using an RTX 5000 series GPU or anything like that. What we've got here are some relatively inexpensive parts and a small form factor case that I personally really like using. And of course, you can always come up with your own combo if you like, but this is what I'm going to be using. And throughout the video, I'll go over all the parts used. But before we get into it, I do want to mention that this video is sponsored by URCD keys. I've been using this site for quite some time now. They offer Steam keys, upplay, Ubisoft, but the main thing I pick up over here are Windows 11 Pro keys. And right now, if you use code ETA, you can get 25% off. So, at checkout, we'll just enter the code ETA. That's going to bring the price down to 22.88. They're going to email you that key and then you can activate Windows. Speaking of that, let's head over to a new PC that I recently built. As you can see, we're running Windows 11. And from settings, we're going to go to activation settings. It's going to tell us that we're not active. We don't have a key installed. So, we're just going to paste it right in here. Choose next. It's going to activate Windows for us, and we're ready to go. If you're in need of cheap Windows keys, I'll leave a link in the description. And remember, you can use code ETA for 25% off. Starting out with the base of the system, we're going back to AM4 here to save some money. And there's a lot of combos to be had online right now. If you check Newegg and Micro Center, you can actually get something very similar to this for 189 over on Newegg. Comes with an MSI motherboard. We've got a MicroATX. And of course, the CPU. And for this, we're going to be using the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X. Six cores, 12 threads. it still offers some great performance, especially at the price point you can pick these up right now at. The motherboard I've got here is an ASUS Prime B550M. And the 5600X does come with its own cooler, but I've got an upgraded cooler here. This is just a bit taller with that copper slug. And we've got a little LED around it. This is the Wraith Spire, but the one that comes with the 5600X is the Wraith Stealth. It's still going to keep it nice and chilly. I just had this and I figured I'd go ahead and use it with this build. As for RAM, I'm going with 16 gigabytes of Team Force DDR4. Since we're using an AM4 platform, I'm at 3200 MHz here in dual channel. For storage, I opted for a 1 TBTE Crucial P3. 1 TB is kind of the minimum that I want to go with. And you could run your operating system from a smaller drive and then store stuff on 3.5 or 2.5 in drives. And if you've already got some drives laying around, then you could save a little bit of cash putting something like this together. So, I've got the motherboard fully assembled. CPU, cooler, RAM, storage. Now, it's time to move over to the case that I'm going to be using with this setup. These are super cheap over on Amazon. It's kind of a no-name case. Only $38. It is a bit larger than some of the other small form factors on the market, but with this, we don't need to use a lowprofile GPU. We can get something much larger in here. It supports miniITX or microATX. Not a lot of bells and whistles here. Does have USB 3 up front. It's kind of a plain jane case, but it does work out really well. Now, keep in mind with this case, it'll only support an SFX power supply. And I'm going to be using this 500 watt AIVA. I do believe that they make a 650 watt just like this. The only difference between the two would be the 500 watt has a single 8 pin PCIe connector for your GPU, and I think the 650 does have dual. I've already installed my motherboard's IO plate in the case, so we can go ahead and slot this down in there. And yeah, I mean it does fit quite well. You can also go miniITX if you can find a cheap enough board. So all that's left to do here is install the power supply, plug in all of my cables, get everything cleaned up, and then we can move over to the GPU. And for this, I really thought about an all AMD build or even go in with that AMD CPU and an Nvidia card, but instead I'm going to be using the Intel ARC B570. So we've got 10 gigs of VRAM here. This is the ASRock version. Originally, these were supposed to launch at $219, but these are around $259 for a brand new one. You might be able to find one used over on eBay, but yeah, if you keep your eye out, you can get something like this. Another option would be the B580 if you can get your hands on one. This ASRock version does have a little bit of a lip on it, so I was worried about the case closing, but it actually does fit. I was quite surprised after just kind of eyeballing it. This does kind of slot right down on it and I shouldn't have any trouble closing this thing up. Okay, so I've got everything together here and it actually came out pretty nice. Now, I wasn't looking to build the best looking gaming PC in the world and we're going to have that side panel on while we're gaming, but yeah, it did go together much nicer than I thought it would. And we'll go ahead and boot this up for the first time. I'm going to be running Windows 11 on this machine. And as you can see, that Intel ARC GPU does have a little bit of RGB. And that rate spire cooler has that AMD logo with the red ring around it. I think it looks really good. One really important thing I want to mention here when running any Intel ARC card is resizable bar. And you need to make sure that it's enabled in the BIOS. With this board, for some reason, it was off out of the box. There is an auto option from advanced, but I want to make sure that this is on. and it might be in a different spot depending on your board's manufacturer, but with these ASUS boards, even in the easy menu here, it's usually located right up top. But if not, you may have to search the advanced section and look for something like PCIe subsystem settings. Okay, so here we are with Windows 11. As you can see, we've got that Ryzen 5 5600X. Uh, six cores, 12 threads, 16 gigs of DDR4 at 3200. Trying to save money here. and of course the Intel Arc B570 with 10 gigs of VRAM. So far, the system's been really stable and I haven't had any kind of thermal throttling on the GPU or CPU, but I am at the stock clocks on everything right now. So, if we take a look here with the Intel graphics software, we did make sure from the BIOS that resizable bar was enabled. This will be red. If not, uh from performance, we do have some tuning that we can do here, but I'm going to leave it stock for all of the testing. from advanced voltage limit, power limit, we can go up to 112% here. And uh we also have voltage curve, VRAM tuning, and fan tuning. With this ASRock card, uh it seems to boost up just fine the way it is and stay nice and cool. In my opinion, ASRock always kind of overdoes it on the cooling system. I mean, it's definitely a good thing, but even if we were to take this power limit up to 112%, we wouldn't have to worry about thermal throttling on that B570. And to give you an idea about the TGP on this card, uh, from Firmark about 96 watts, I've seen it jump up to around 114 when I first initially start running this clock here, 2400 MHz. And if we wanted to, we could increase that power limit, get a little more out of it. But we're going to leave it right where it is. And now I want to jump into some 1440p gaming on this thing. And the first one we have here is Cyberpunk 2077 1440p ultra with XCSS set to balanced. I'm seeing an average of around 65 FPS. So maybe taking it down to high here. And I think what's really kind of holding the uh B570 back with this game is just that 5600X CPU. Next game we have here is Marvel Rivals. We're at 1440p Ultra. And this is one of those games that does have XESS Brain Gen and XESS low latency built in. So I did turn it on. Without it, we were seeing an average of around 71 FPS with it. But with it enabled, we're over 120 FPS on average. And to tell you the truth, if I went into this game blind, I wouldn't know that we had frame gen on right now, especially with that low latency mode enable. I had to throw in one of my favorite games. We've got Fallout 4 here at 1440p ultra, so we're maxed out. And I did try this at 120. Unfortunately, at 120 with this game, we're only seeing around 90 FPS on average. So, I figured I'd just go ahead and lock it down at 60. And with this, I mean, you can have a really good time with it. Forsa Horizon 5 1440p ultra. Going in, I knew we were going to have a good time with this game. We're over 100 FPS on average. And in fact, this B570 paired up with the 5600X can run this at 4K at 68 FPS on average. So you can lock it at 60 4K ultra and play it all day long. [Music] Doom Eternal. I'm just kind of gearing up for Dark Ages 1440p. Ultra Nightmare. I've got the in-game statistics up in the top right hand corner. After Burner in the top lefthand corner, we're not using any scaling here. By the end of this run, I had an average of 138 FPS out of this game. And I mean, it does look really good. Again, kind of wanted to throw this in cuz I'm gearing up for Dark Ages. That's something I'm really excited about. And the final game I wanted to test was God of War Ragnarok 1440p Ultra. And initially I went into this with XESS set to quality, but we had some dips under 60, so I had to take it to balance. Now XESS does scale up really nicely, especially on this card here. And using the settings that I have here, we're getting an average of 68 FPS. [Applause] The last thing I wanted to talk about here were CPU and GPU temps in this small case. When it comes to CPU temps, side panel on, stock fan curve from the BIOS, average 1440p gaming 66° C, and we had a max recorded of 87. So, it did get a bit hotter than I'd like, but again, we've got that stock fan curve. We could definitely take it up a bit from the BIOS. And as for the GPU, average 1440p gaming, 63° C, and the maximum it hit was 68° C. GPU temps looking good. Would like to kind of increase that fan curve just a bit so we don't hit that max 87° there with this 5600X. And remember, we're not even using the Raid Stealth cooler. We've got that larger cooler here. Just really comes down to air flow inside of this case. Overall, love the form factor. I think it turned out really nicely and performance here is really great, especially if you can pick up one of these 5600X motherboard combos. And they're all over the place. Again, I'll leave links in the description to everything that I used, but keep an eye out on Newegg, MicroEnter, and even Amazon for those motherboard, RAM, and CPU combos. But that's going to wrap it up for this video. If you're interested in putting something like this together, all links will be in the description. And keep an eye out on the channel because I think I can get Steam OS up and running on this thing also. But like always, thanks for watching.",1,The video is a straightforward tutorial on building a budget gaming PC

Plus, this phone has the longest software support in the segment with 6 years of OS updates and a ton of AI features. Now, coming to what's bad, there are a lot of ads and bloatware in it. The processor is underpowered compared to all the other phones, so it's only good for day-to-day usage. No high FPS gaming on this phone. The front looks outdated with a teardrop notch and a massive chin. And even though it's an OLED panel, the fingerprint scanner is still on the sides. There's 5,000 mAh battery, but the charger is not included in the box. And even though Netflix comes pre-installed, you still don't get HDR support on it. And there are no stereo speakers as well.

You got that same smashing slender design as always, plus a handful of upgrades to improve the overall experience. And best of all, it's just 300 quid, which is an absolute bargain. I've had my SIM secret accreted inside of here for the best part of a week. So here's my Motorola Edge60 Fusion review. And for more on the latest and greatest tech, please do poke subscribe and ding that notifications bell. Cheers. Now, first up, as always, the Edge60 Fusion comes packed in a box which is heavily perfumed, which seems to have become Motorola's thing these past couple of years. And certainly for the first day or so, that scent heavily lingers on this phone. Busy smells like the inside of an Essex brothel. Thankfully, does feed after that, but some people will like it. My daughter couldn't stop sniffing this thing. And of course, the for itself is the usual delightfully skinny wee bugger. Actually appears to be even more slender than it actually is, courtesy of the curvy finish, which you've got here on the screen just slopes away at those edges and also around back to the point where that middle frame is pretty much non-existent. The Fusion phones are always absolute stunners. At this sort of budget price point, you'll struggle to find a better looking blower. As always, that display pretty much fill in the front end of the Fusion. Bugger all bezels surrounding it. And the frame of the phone, what little of it there actually is, is unfortunately just made of plastic. And while it looks shiny, it does a pretty good job of masking fingerprints and grimy grubbiness. And around back, you've got yourself a bit of vegan leather action. So, because if you lick it, it tastes about as good as vegan food. And again, got to love the design work here. Not only does that vegan leather feel fantastic, it adds a nice bit of grip. So, perfect if you are trying to fumble about using this phone one-handed. Also great if you're sticking this phone down on a table on a train or something that's moving about all over the place cuz it doesn't slip and slide. And I also adore the way that the camera bump blends almost seamlessly in with the back end of the phone. Just a slight ridge there. As you can see, it doesn't stick too far out the back end. And I do love the color that Motorola has gone with here as well. This is the Panon Amazonite version. Probably absolutely mulled that pronunciation. Otherwise, you can also grab the Motorola Edge60 Fusion in Panon Slipstream here in the UK. And I'll be honest, I looked that up a couple of days ago, but my whiskey adult brain has already completely forgotten what kind of color that is. Now, there's no pre-installed screen protector slapped onto the Edge 60 Fusion, but you do get a Gorilla Glass 7i display and touch word. That panel seems to be pretty hardy. This phone has taken a couple of tumbles this past week and so far no scuffs, no scratches on there. Apparently, this phone has passed a whole bunch of military standard 810H tests to prove that it's a proper hard case. It can survive tumbles of just over a meter. It can withstand extreme temperatures, crazy climates, ridiculous altitudes. I can't really personally vouch for most of this though because the craziest place I've taken this thing is my local Gregs. And as usual, of course, full IP68 water and dust resistant, so it can be fully submerged in the drink. And it's also apparently now IP69 rated, so it can survive a severe spurtin. Anyway, if you actually want to use the Motorola Edge 60 Fusion, while you've got an indis optical fingerprint sensor, this has been doing its job absolutely fine these past few days. Like most optical sensors, it does struggle if your hands are a bit grubby, bit sticky, whatever. But otherwise, as you can see there, reasonably responsive, fast to act. And of course, Motorola usually goes with a fairly stock vibe for the Android experience. But it is slowly turning into a more motorized version these days. So, for instance, here in the apps tree, you'll notice very different from the standard stock Android effort. You've now got a news feed in there. So, you can read about all the happy jolly things happening in the world, mostly involving a man who looks like he's been excessively tangled. You've got your current and trending news and also any other bits that you say that you're interested in. I do wonder if Motorola is setting this up as a sort of replacement to the Google discover feed. You've also got your journal section stuffed in here as well which I'll come on to later. Thankfully very little crapware stuffed on the Edge 60 Fusion. So basically Facebook which you can get right and LinkedIn of course and that's pretty much your lot. And then of course you got that Moto app which acts as a hub to some of the best features that Motorola has chucked on here. Plenty of personalization which is always good to see. Very easy to switch up the fonts, the icon shapes, even the fingerprint animation, although it would be good to have a few more options. Got to be said, it is slightly annoying how the Motorola Edge60 Fusion doesn't have an always on display. What you've got instead is the sleep display which you can wake up with a tap or by picking up the phone. There's no option to have that always on. And got to say, personally not a fan of the live lock screen as well, which again ties directly into the latest headlines on whatever you're interested in cuz it's pretty much guaranteed if I'm in a mad rush to unlock my smartphone to, you know, get a ticket out or check something, I'll accidentally end up tapping into this bloody discover thing and then spend ages trying to get the hell out of it again. No worries, though. You can completely disable that quickly and easily. Of course, Mortal has chucked the usual excellent selection of gestures on here. And yes, that does include the karate torch chop. And of course, Android 15 already pretty hot when it comes to privacy and security features, but Mod Roll has chucked a few extra bonus bits on here. The likes of the pin pad scramble definitely worth jumping on board with if you do find yourself using your PIN out and about in public. And there's some other good stuff like the gaming mode, which I'll mention later. And unless you've been dead these last couple of years, you may have noticed that smartphone manufacturers are going pretty heavy on the AI stuff. And Motorola, no exception, of course. The Edge60 Fusion has a suite of AI shenanigans. Now, of course, yes, you do have all the standard Android AI stuff slapped on here. Give it a circle to search, for instance. And you do have Gemini on here, but on top of this, you've also got Motorola's AI assistant, which you can rouse from its slumber by long pressing the power button, or you can also double press the power button. It's fully customizable, and you can also access it via the apps tray. Now, you can ask or search for absolutely anything you like. Why is Sunderland Football Club suddenly pants? Don't expect the answers to be quite as good as what you'd get on something like Gemini, unfortunately. you're best off sticking to, you know, what's the weather going to be like later. I was hoping that the Moto AI would be able to summarize a web page for me, but unfortunately, you can't do this directly. You've got to copy and paste the article text into the chat box, which then does work, but it's a bit clunky. One of the better options is remember this, which is kind of similar to the essentials space, which uh nothing introduced with the phone 3A series. And so what happens is you stumble across a web page or some information that you want to save for later. Just say remember this, take a screenshot, and then it does ask you to just add a little bit of information. So tickets for 2,000 trees, and then it'll generally just take a few seconds for that to be processed. And it can extract a bit of information from the actual screen grab or whatever itself. And then everything you save appears in the journal section of the feed. It's quite handy if you got any QR codes you need to save, anything like that. Search the journal for the price of those 2,000 trees tickets. It'll take a wee while, but eventually, boom, there we go. You've also got the update me feature, which can briefly summarize any unread group chats and other messages you've got sat there waiting for you, which is quite handy if you are on a lot of group chats. You don't have time to quickly flick through all of them, see if you've missed anything urgent. It can also provide summaries of any missed calls or other bits, but it can't summarize any emails that you've got sat there waiting for you, which is kind of a shame. So, sort of limited use that one. And of course, all these features, they're all fairly fresh, so they are still a little bit bulky. They definitely need some tweaking, some refining, but give them a bit of time. They could be well worth using. And certainly shown a lot more encouraging signs early on compared with Apple Intelligence. Although admittedly, that's kind of like saying a dog is better at algebra than a house brick. Oh yeah, and Motorola is offering three years of OS updates and four years of security patching with the Edge60 Fusion. Of course, I wouldn't expect the most timely updates here. And some rivals like Samsung do offer bonus years of support on top of that, but still respectable. It's great to see the Motorola has shoved 256 gigs of storage into the Edge 60 Fusion, which is double what you get with the standard iPhone 16, for instance, which costs considerably more. And on top of that, you've also got a bit of micro SD memory card support, so you can expand it. And in further good news, the Edge 60 Fusion also supports eSIM, which is great news if you do a lot of traveling or whatever. Just get one of those set up for your destination. And the good times just keep on rolling. When it comes to the display tech, you've got a 6.67 inch PLED panel here. And it's an absolute cracker at this price point. It certainly seems to be even bigger, even more spacious than it actually is, courtesy of the supremely skinny bezels. You got a 2712x 1220 pixel resolution, so slightly sharper than the previous generation. Slap it into the vivid mode in the display settings and those colors are proper poppy and certainly my favorite of the options. Currently no HDR streaming support in apps like Netflix, but I had absolutely no quibbles when it came to the contrast. While this screen is also comfortably bright enough to clearly see outdoors, even if you're wearing shades, you can see what is going on. You can read messages, etc. If you jump on into the display settings, you will see there is a flicker prevention option. Although this is turned off by default, you will have to switch that on if you want to use it. Got a bit of nightlight shenanigans. Make things a bit easier on the old peepers in low light. And the refresh rate maxes out at 120 Hz. As you can see there, just manually stick it on either 60 or 120. And of course, one of the concerns when you've got a smartphone with a curved display like this is the screen responsiveness. Sometimes if you're clutching it tight, it can bulk up the responsiveness. So, you can be tapping on the display and it just won't register or whatever. Touchwood doesn't seem to happen very often at all here on the Edge60 Fusion. A couple of times it's gone a bit wonky, but generally very well behaved. And the Edge 60 Fusion also sports a stereo speaker setup, which is pretty loud, although not quite properly balanced. That earpiece speaker is noticeably tittier and weaker than the bottom mounted speaker, but absolutely fine if you just slap on a bit of YouTube in the kitchen or something like that. You got full Dolby Atmos support on here as well. No headphone jack sadly, which is something that you used to get on a lot of Motorola budgety smartphones, but hey, the Bluetooth streaming absolutely fine. No glitch in there or anything. Now, performance is provided by MediaTek's Dimensity 7300 chipset, and that's backed here on the Edge60 Fusion by just 8 gigs of RAM. And I have seen a fair few glitches and quirks, shall we say, in my week with the Edge60 Fusion, although quite a lot of these I do put down to the software rather than the hardware. One of the most common quirks I've experienced on here is if I'm streaming something in Netflix, I just quickly yank down the notifications panel. When I go back, the picture will have completely frozen while the audio continues to play in the background. Quite often have to skip back 10 seconds in order to unbol it and get it all playing normally again. You know, we bits of bulkiness aside, actually skimming through the UI and everything is reasonably smooth. No real troubles there. Apps load up pretty quickly. You can multitask quite happily. And when it comes to gaming, well, you've got Mod Rollers's usual gaming modes slapped on here, which is pretty simple compared with some rivals that you get from the likes of OnePlus and Xiaomi smartphones. It's got a couple of useful tools slapped in there. And I did find that when I was playing more intensive titles like Weather and Waves, for instance, this ran absolutely fine on the lower graphics settings until things got proper mental. I'm talking like a dozen, two dozen rather angry beasties all trying to murder me simultaneously. It's only marginally worse than that time that I went on holiday in Middlesborough. But during quieter moments, you certainly experienced a much more stable frame rate. Generally held up fine. The game was perfectly playable. But I would say if you are a hardcore gamer, you might want to up your budget a bit and try and find something a bit more capable. One thing's for sure, that Dimensity chipset, nice and energy efficient, and Motorola has stuffed a 5,200 mAh capacity battery inside of that slender frame. That's a slight upgrade over the previous generation. And I found that the battery life was absolutely sublime on the Edge 60 Fusion. Most days I found with even around sort 6 to 7 hours of screen on time, plenty of video streaming, good bit of audio streaming in the background, plenty of camera action, all that good stuff, I typically ended a long day with around 30% battery life still in the tank. The only way I ever managed to get this thing in battery saver mode in a single day was if I did a lot of video chatting or a lot of video recording or of course played something like Wither and Waves for well over an hour. And on the flip side, if you're a bit more chill with it, it will happily last you a full weekend. Now, same as the previous generation, if you do need to top it up in a jiffy, well, no worries. You got 68 watt wired charging support here. So, bung a cable in it, you'll see that battery meter fly up. Though, there is sodle support for wireless charging, which is a bit of a shame, although not entirely unexpected given the £300 asking price. So, last up for this lovely bit of Motorola Edge 60 Fusion review action, let's have a squint at the old optics. You can quickload the camera with a double push of that power button. And certainly from the specs, it appears like Motorola hasn't tinkered with the camera tech at all from the previous generation, but you do actually have different sensors in there. So, it's a 50 megapixel primary shooter using Sony's IMX 896 and then the only alternative lens is a 13 megapixel ultra wideangle shooter using a Galaxy core sensor. I have found that the camera app can be tediously slow at times. Not right now, of course. Now, it's going to be absolutely perfectly behaved. But of course, you can guarantee the very second your kid or your cat does something really cute and you just quickly swap in between the different camera modes or camera sensors, it'll suddenly decide to take its sweet time. You got the usual variety of modes and everything stuck on here. So, you got the obligatory portrait mode. You do have a pro mode where you can mess around with the likes of the white balance, the ISO levels, etc. And you can shoot in raw format and the likes of ultra as well. If you want to shoot in the full 50 megapixels as in the regular photo mode, you are shooting 12 megapixel images by default. You've also got the choice of snapping natural looking images, otherwise turning on auto enhance, which is particularly handy for those high contrast situations. Enhanced mode does brighten up a pick similar to what you'll get with iPhones and Samsung's. It can work pretty well for scenery shots and the like. In natural mode, the Edge 60 Fusion captures quite realistic tones. And even when the lighting is a bit CAC, you shouldn't see too much noise infiltrating your photos. In fact, some of my HDR snaps came out much better than expected. While night shots again look pretty decent for a budget blower. And some of the portrait shots sped out by the Fusion are especially gorgeous. natural skin tones and no overly enthusiastic edge smoothing. Cracking stuff. Of course, there's no optical zoom on offer here, but you can still digitally zoom a respectable amount before the detail levels become a bit murky. And that ultrawide shooter is pretty good compared with many budget rivals. Again, dealing quite well with dodgy contrast and not mucking up those colors too bad. Now, no real surprises when it comes to the video action. You can record up to 4K resolution footage at 30 frames pers. If you want 60 frames per second, you'll have to knock the resolution down to full HD. Now, video output isn't quite as impressive as the photos cuffed up by the Edge 60 Fusion. You can expect more noisy results and duller tones in lower light and with strong contrast. But still, stabilization is perfectly decent, so you can move around while you shoot. And the focus is reliable enough to stay trained on your subject. while audio capture is pretty clean as long as there's no unexpected gusts or anything. And then finally for the camera shenanigans, you've got a 32 megapixel selfie shooter up front. And using that front-facing selfie cam, you can shoot up to 4K ultra HD resolution video at 30 frames per second or 60 frames pers option. But stabilization is pretty good. You can wander about and talk and shoot at the same time. No worries. And those mics do a pretty good job of picking up your voice. Not the loudest, not the cleanest, but not bad at all. And there you have it, my lovelies. That in a moist and delicious nutshell is what I reckon of Motorola's Edge60 Fusion. Frankly, bit of a bargain at 300 quid. I absolutely adore that gorgeous bright poppy PLED display. The battery life has been fantastic. The camera tech pretty reliable. And then you got the added bonus of the fact you got 256 gigs of storage, which is expandable. You got the eSIM support. all these little features which Motorola didn't have to chuck in there, but I'm really glad that they did. Of course, it isn't quite perfect. You will find phones out there with better performance and has been a little bit quirky, a little bit buggy here and there. Motorola AI shows a lot of promise, but it is still very much early days there, too. In fact, one of the rivals that I would recommend to the Edge 60 Fusion is the Nothing Phone 3A, which of course has all that sexy glyph lighting shenanigans. Another great set of specs and the likes of the essential space on there does a better job frankly right now than remember this on the Motorola. But hey, that's what this bold northern knobber reckons. It'll be great to hear your thoughts down in the comments below. Please do poke subscribe and ding that notifications bell for more on the latest and greatest tech and have yourselves a ruddy wonderful rest of the week. Cheers everyone. Love you.

this will undoubtedly be not just Samsung's bestselling phone for 2025 but the best selling Android phone overall worldwide and it could potentially be the bestselling smartphone period out selling even the iPhone we'll come back to that point momentarily the second thing you need to know is that for about 9 0% of the general population this is all the smartphone they really need now let me expand upon my premature Proclamation touting this phone as 2025 is best seller already looking past the outrageous interest this phone already has had on social media when you see the sales numbers for the previous generations of this tier of a series the a11 the a12 the a13 14 and 15 they were all near the top of the bestseller list quarter after quarter year after year and I think it's only fair to assume that that will continue I suppose in 6 to 12 months you can come back to this video and tell me if I was completely wrong but I don't think I will be because and this is me expanding on my second point from a moment ago this is a really familiar really affordable smartphone from everyone's favorite brand that's for all intents and purposes just as good for scrolling through Instagram and texting your friends as something four times the price or it's at least not four times s worse than the $800 S Series phone Samsung would probably prefer you bu instead what you miss out on not getting that S Series phone probably isn't worth hundreds and hundreds of extra dollars of course this a16 isn't the cheapest phone you can buy it isn't even the cheapest Samsung phone actually it's also not the best budget phone when you consider its specs and capabilities along with its limitations and omissions this year it's not all that attractive or unique and arguably it isn't even that different from all its predecessors but it's one of the very few affordable options we have here in the US the Samsung name still sustains immense popularity everywhere else in the world it's what people prefer to have there's that convenience being within Samsung's ecosystem and the benefits of their software and when you put all this together and also remember just how many previous a somethings are already out there being used by people who are considering an upgrade I I don't think there's any reason this won't be the number one smartphone for 2025 now I want to talk more about this phone so you have a better understanding of what's new and different from the previous phones what you can expect performance-wise the limitations with this kind of device and I want this to be sort of group exercise so if you have this phone or one of the previous Aeries devices let me know your experience in the comments below before that though and I can't stress this enough please protect yourself and your data on online expressvpn this video is sponsor is a great way to do just that with expressvpn you can hide your IP address encrypt your network traffic and be sure that Dockers advertisers or anyone else with bad intentions isn't tracking your activity or stealing your info you already know you should definitely use a VPN on public Wi-Fi networks like airports or coffee shops but even at home you should retain as much online privacy as possible I use expressvpn 24/7 because I'm tired of the countless ads I see that seem like they're reading my mind they're

aren't available in your region or just bypass any other internet censorship or restrictions with one click you can change your IP address to a different country and then voila you get to see what

secure servers 24/7 customer support and a host of other features all baked into one app click the link in the video description below scan the QR code on screen now or go to expressvpn.com td25 to find out how you can get 4 months of expressvpn for free so one of the most enticing things about this tier of a series and it's once again true with the a16 is that this phone at its full retail price $199 is a fraction of the S Series phones but more than than likely you'll get this a16 from a carrier or prepaid Network for even cheaper like $99 and by the summertime it's usually a free phone with a new line and I know there are plenty of deals and discounts for the flagships too but at a glance when you see the prices side by side I think it's easy to understand why someone might pick up this phone first when you do grab this a16 there's a few things you'll notice immediately the first is its size it's 6.7 in this year at least its visible screen area is and that's a little bigger than the a15 which is great but every other year these a series phones just sort of flip-flop back and forth between 6.5 6.6 and 6.7 in so you may not even be able to tell a difference it's not like you gain much in the end with what you're actually looking at but I suppose it's nice that this phone is technically as big as the s24 plus unfortunately Samsung still refuses to give up this dated budgeted look with the old school camera Notch and the thick noticeable bottom chin thanks in part to the older screen technology it's not a phone that looks good by 2025 standards but you'd be surprised by how many people are perfectly fine with this setup especially if you've been using all the other a series phones from the previous years it's probably all you've ever known around back Samsung basically decided a couple of years ago to make all their phones look exactly the same so face down if you have this a116 in a pile with an s24 or an Fe or a higher tier a series like the a55 you're not going to tell any of them apart which is cool it's not like this phone looks cheap in the lineup but it feels cheap since it's all plastic no premium materials here whatsoever the back is a simple glossy plastic cover the sides and frame are a thicker plastic that mimics metal but it isn't and the front display glass actually doesn't seem to be anything special either that's why there's so much glare and so many fingerprints and it's one of the main reasons why this phone is so affordable but for the first time on this tier of a series The a16 is now IP 54 dust and splash resistant so no you shouldn't take it swimming but if you accidentally get it a little wet it'll be perfectly fine now there's two things that people always want to see on these a series phones the first fortunately is still here a Micro SD card slot within the physical SIM card tray this phone can be configured with either 128 or 256 GB of storage which isn't terrible but the option and flexibility to add more storage via an inexpensive SD card is always nice the other thing well you can see that big empty space the headphone jack has been removed this year I guess this was inevitable it's been slowly taken away on each of the higher tier phones every other year but I know it's still going to bug a bunch of people not everyone wants to deal with wireless earbuds even though Samsung has a bunch to sell you I get that but you can still get USBC see wired earbuds that'll do the trick if it's any consolation so last year with the a15 Samsung made a big leap with the display and bringing a Super AMOLED panel to that phone this year unfortunately the screen seems to be unchanged aside from its slight increase in size but that's not the worst news in the world your 6.7 in viewing experience here consists of a 2340 x 1080 resolution Super AMOLED 90 HZ panel with a peak brightness of around 88 100 nits that you'll see only with auto brightness enabled and in action mainly in outdoor use otherwise the 400ish knits of Max user controlled brightness will probably be the biggest complaint if you can tolerate the glare the colors and resolution are both great and the 90 HZ refresh rate while it is an Adaptive still makes the phone look and feel kind of fast I think for me this is like the bare minimum standard of displays nowadays no matter the price to the phone it's a big screen it's a colorful screen you're not going to get any higher resolution than this and it's still a better refresh rate than the iPhone that's a bunch of wins in my book and it's more than enough to make most everyone happy but I always like to say that it really does depend on your perspective and your previous smartphone experience like of course this screen looks dull dim and extra smudgy compared to the s24 ultra but for under 200 bucks there's nothing about this viewing experience to me that's an outright issue and I also don't know what else Samsung could have added that wouldn't have just overlapped the higher tier phones arguably all Samsung phones should probably have a 120 HZ 1080p Super AMOLED display that doesn't look like it's from 2018 but I'm sure the compromises here continue to just keep the costs down which is probably the most important thing and fortunately Samsung didn't outright cheap out on what's probably the most important aspects of the smartphone what I don't understand is why Samsung can't install what's probably a 1 cent part into this phone you get just one bottom speaker no dual stereo speaker setup like most other phones have and the speaker here it's fine but come on a decent set of dual speakers when so many people listen to stuff out loud nowadays and when you already took away the headphone jack should have been the consolation prize [Music] as far as performance well I'm sure most of you were waiting to or have already left some sort of comment saying that this phone is underpowered laggy or a hunk of junk because of a certain processor that was used on some of them but here's the thing if you have those thoughts about this phone I don't think you were ever seriously considering it anyway the a16 just like all its predecessors is a device that's meant to do a little more than the bare minimum but otherwise not blow you away or come out ahead in any speed tests inside the a16 this year will have either the mediatech dimensity 6300 or Samsung's own exos 1330 how can you tell which one you're buying well aside from checking the product info online and hoping it's correct there's not really a definitive way on top of that there's four six and 8 gab configuration options for Ram for this phone so spec for spec it's kind of hard to make a straightforward comparison with last year's a15 because there's just a lot of factors in play here by the way there's also a 4G only version of the a16 with a different mediatech processor entirely I don't know why Samsung has to make this so confusing I mean do all the different countries and regions around around the world really need these subtle differences in components it seems unlikely but in my experience with my a16 well this phone is a little slower to do most things compared to what I'm used to it's a perfectly fine phone to get you through the day it can scroll through your videos for hours on end it'll be perfectly fine for Google Maps you can jump from web page to text messages without losing your place most of the time and as long as you're not coming from like ms24 Ultra which I don't think you are I can't imag imagine you're going to be too grumpy about how this phone feels again it's all about perspective and your expectations can you game with the a16 sure I don't have a ton of issues playing some of the games I like the launch and load screens take a little while and you're not going to be enabling the high graphic settings more than likely but you can pass the time at the doctor's office with your favorite titles it's a perfectly fine functioning smartphone for the vast majority of people who do basic stuff day in and day out my saying is always if you need to stay connect Ed to the world and maybe do a little more that's what this phone is for with that being said there is also one more new advantage and opting for this phone not only is it currently running the full featured Android 14 update with one UI 6.1 but Samsung says they'll push six major Android and oneui updates to this phone which is a new record for this tier of a series so if you like getting the latest version of Android and you don't want to buy a new phone next year the year after that or basically until 203 well this a16 is still going to be running the latest software features by then for a lot of years it always felt that these cheap Samsung phones were one-year devices like Samsung just assumed you'd get a new free or cheap device every single year because they were free or cheap and they kind of stopped working but now Samsung seems totally fine with you keeping this phone for a long time and I think that's awesome you may as well and if you spend full price for this thing you're getting every dollar's worth and then some over the long run one other way you can actually get your money's worth with this phone is by buying a 25 wat fast charger to pair it with Samsung hasn't included a charger in the Box for years now we know this but even this cheaper a16 supports the fast charging speeds you paid for them when you bought this phone in a way so you may as well enjoy it you can go from 0 to 100% in under 2 hours and the 5,000 milliamp battery should probably last you through the day anyway this size battery is literally in every Samsung phone nowadays at least the a series and I know there's a lot of other factors at play but I don't know anyone who can't get like 10 to 12 hours of screen on time with this phone which is more than enough for most people I've actually even seen comments saying these cheap a series devices are 2day phones since a lot of folks just don't use these phones that much anyway so that's great too finally I've consistently said that the biggest compromise overall with a budget a series phone like this one is the camera setup and I think there's two explanations for this one Flagship smartphone cameras have just been the main focus for Samsung for Apple for Google and for all the other brands for years now it's like the only thing they say they change on these phones and the other thing is that Samsung really hasn't added or changed anything on these budget phones camera wise and that's a little odd I mean this is the exact same camera setup as last year's a15 the same 50 megapixel main lens 5 megapixel Ultra wide and 2 megapixel macro and the same 13 megapixel selfie lens there's also the same set of shooting modes and features we've seen I feel like for 3 or 4 years probably and it's all fine like you're not going to get a horrendous looking picture out of this phone at least not in broad daylight I think in low light whether you use the dedicated night mode or not this phone struggles there's a ton of noise the Shadows are lost dim pictures and nighttime shots probably don't look good if we're being honest but generally speaking you're not going to regret getting a picture of something important with this phone it'll be just fine but it's not a good camera setup by today's standards the gap between this phone and a flagship is just so much wider and it's missing a lot of critical things like better Zoom better video stability 4K recording consistent Focus obviously low light nighttime shots are a bit of a Miss there's tons of ways in which the camera setup could be improved and just like with the display I feel like there could be a universal bare minimum standard that Samsung brings to all their smartphones for the cameras this isn't it and I'm surprised Samsung hasn't really changed anything here for the past few years so all in all I feel like I was pretty fair with this a16 when you consider both its limitations and its advantages this is once again a budget phone through and through and for those of us used to the top tier ultas and other Flagship devices I mean this just isn't a phone we'd ever be considering but for most of the non- Tey people the general population the average everyday consumer this is a super affordable familiar phone that accomplishes the tasks and asks that they would want whether you choose to believe it or not the numbers say that this tier of smartphone millions and millions of people will buy year after year and regardless of the exos processor and the lack of a headphone jack this a16 is probably going to be Samsung's best seller and maybe even the best seller overall for all smartphones for 2025 but what do you guys think about the a16 am I crazy am I wrong let me know in the comments down below I'd love to hear your thoughts of course hopefully you guys did enjoy this video though be sure to follow Tech daily on Twitter and subscribe to the tech daily YouTube channel if you haven't already and I'll see you guys later",1,The

360}}",,ik_3EG77nsw,749,214405,en,ik_3EG77nsw,"okay this probably might be the most popular OnePlus launch OnePlus 13r and if you look at OnePlus currently OnePlus used to be the smartphone every Android ands bought but from that to now IU is selling more phones than OnePlus OnePlus sales are at an all-time low the phone suffered a lot of display slm motherboard issues OnePlus is trying hard to make a comeback so so in these scenarios we wanted to test this phone and use it daily for a month and like we said this is one of the many long-term 30-day reviews that we want to do this year now if you draw a line and mention the OnePlus 12 are on the left and OnePlus 13 are on the right there are a lot of upgrades the battery is now 6,000 MH you finally get a 2X telephoto camera and the usual processor and storage upgrades those are there but while using the phone testing it there are a lot of downgrades as well like this phone doesn't carry silicon carbon battery charging has been downgraded since it is a single cell battery charging takes more time than last year so all of this wrapped into one proper video this 1 was 1R cost around 4,000 should you get it there's also this Samsung s23 at a discount now and IU Neo 10 Pro is also around the corner what about that well this is ptik you're already watching teisa and let's divide this video into the good the bad the ugly now again OnePlus 13r doesn't come with a charger in Europe and UK but luckily in India you get everything inside but the days are counting I believe eventually every manufacturer will remove charger from the box so you'll have to pay for this later and what you can pay for right now is VPN and here's a word from our sponsor s shock VPN fair thing we have been personally using S shock VPN before they even approached us for this video and reasons why you should get a paid VPN like obviously you are being tracked anywhere that you browse or watch on the internet so getting a paid VPN makes sense and important for two reasons number one sof shock VPN works on all websites seamlessly with good privacy and you can even unlock content from other parts of the world which are not available in India number two ssha cost as less as $2.09 per month or12 rupes per month you'll get unlimited device access so you can share it with your friends and family and you get 4 months extra free if you get it from surf shark.com teiser also there is a 30-day money back guarantee so there's no harm in trying this is a super limited time de now the first thing to like about the phone is the moment you hold the phone it's that boxy Square design the phone feels big in the hands like the frame is all metallic build now let's talk about the elephant in the room design this is the OnePlus 12r and this is the OnePlus 13r they look way different now a lot of people on Twitter were unhappy with the design and I also had a similar thought the OnePlus 12 and 12r looked glossy where the camera Island was kind of attached to the side frames but from the 13 series the camera island is independent floating and if you til the phone a bit you can see these concentric circles or trails that shine fancy words personally still not a fan of this design but what I liked is the displays are now flat so getting a tempered glass or screen protector is easy also if you keep it like this on the table it can stand without any support and if you really hate the design put in the cover it's done you don't need to see it and moving on to the front I am a fan of flat displays you get this 6.78 in 120 HZ ltpo flat display like flat so I decided to rewatch The Interstellar on Netflix and the color sharpness and all were very good even the display here was pretty bright and no matter how many times you see the movie some things are never clear now the display does support HDR and Dolby Vision on Netflix hdr on YouTube and one claims this can go up to 4500 nits Peak brightness well we tested it so we opened a bright white color HDR video and use this camera flash to make it look like you're watching an HDR video in bright sunlight and after all of this we could only make it hit 22 2300 nits so 4500 nits is a huge number in real life it goes about 16 to 2,000 nits Max to Max 2700 nits recently I was using the display beside s25 Ultra and this is not a fair comparison but it doesn't seem 4500 nits type bright Outdoors now here's a small trick we discovered this while you set up your phone sign up with your OnePlus ID you'll get this option to claim 6 months replacement do it once you get the phone so if any hardware failure happens to the OnePlus 13r this device will get replaced and you will get a new OnePlus 13r of course this does not include breaking your phone after a fight in a phone call none of that now we didn't get the chance to test this this claim I mean thank God but OnePlus also made claims that they have made the display Tough Enough for Indian conditions so the green line issue should stop now and to ensure that they are also offering a lifetime warranty for the green line now the second thing which has been an instant like is the software so the 1 30r comes with the latest oxygen os5 based on Android 15 out of the box software is very smooth if you see side by side with the iPhone 16 Galaxy s24 and even the oxygen os4 on 1plus 12 R I'll open and close multiple apps and boy oh boy oxygen os5 flies now the this is not something that you'll do in real life cuz most of us and you we use the phone in normal way so day-to-day life the animation has been smooth a and a weird thing happened to me while I was using the phone initially I got Chinese text a couple of places in gallery and camera app I took screenshot but now it's fixed seems like someone didn't do their homework well now in terms of features there has been some wallpaper changes you get these flux themes you can choose a wallpaper of your liking and this transition from aod to lock screen looks super smooth you can't have custom text though these are predefined and we had covered the features of oxygen os5 in depth in this video so apart from all those features some new features are OnePlus AI yes OnePlus AI I'm not even making up the name now apart from article summary AI writer here are some cool OnePlus AI tricks like when you open WhatsApp in the sidebar you get this AI reply so what it does is the AI goes through the last four to five text tries to understand the context and based on that it tries to generate replies and surprisingly even if you have your chat in English the AI reply can understand it and generate English replies so next time you are clueless in the middle of a conversation of that special someone OnePlus AI got you they should have called it oxygen AI come on man rest there's the usual AI features in gallery AI eraser reflection eraser Etc I believe now every brand has started giving these or else you get all of that in Google photos also you now get Circle to search so the AI here sits as your friend in your phone who helps to get things done another thing OnePlus has said that the AI call translate will come to the 13 Series where software update so that's there and talking about software updates the update support has been upgraded by a year so the 13r will get four years of software update and 6 years of security update now apart from all of this another thing that was good has been battery life like on a single charge on my heavy usage of playing games watching content reading articles and all of that it easily lasted me 1 and A2 days on some days it was even 2 days and talking about battery let's talk about the downgrades what's bad see this year the battery type has been downgraded OnePlus is using a single cell 6,000 M battery now the problem with that is see if it's a dual cell battery imagine this as a two-way Road more cars can go so in terms of battery you can charge both the batteries at 50/50 W and overall charging time is less and you get 100 wat charging but with single cell the road is only one so less cars can go so in terms of battery you can charge it only at 80 wat rather than 100 wat last year so to charge 100% this phone takes about 1 hour which is 2 times more than last year's OnePlus 12 R now if you're coming from Samsung or Google none of this matter this is not that bad but this this is what has changed this year another silent downgrade is glass protection it comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 7i and this glass protection usually comes with budget and mine smartphones last year it was coring G glass victus 2 now victus 2 offers better production when you drop it on concrete roads here it's nothing like that now all of these things are fine phones have some compromises some downgrades these are fine but what's not good is the ugly see this is the most awaited part performance so oneus 13r comes with the last year's Flagship chip Snapdragon 8 gen 3 and there is a bump in Ram and storage in the base variant and this time there is no mistake this is ufs 4.0 now we have the 16 plus 512gb variant here so we ran the n22 Benchmark which gives an overall score to the phone CPU GPU Ram Etc and we got around 17.8 lakh now all OnePlus phones come with a performance mode so when we turned on the high performance mode and again ran n22 it scored around 21.0 to L on 922 this is the highest I have ever seen a 8 gen 3 phone score now all of this is good but these are Benchmark how does it perform in real life heavy task and we went in all testing the max performance first of all I opened bgmi bgmi natively supports 120 FPS but no matter what we do it won't run on 120 FPS on this phone it's stuck at 60 HZ and 60 FPS maybe it's a bug with bgmi because on the Elder 1plus 13 bgmi runs at 120 FPS now there's a small jard in this you can go and turn on this Frame boost option now it will go to 120 FPS but this is generated frames this is not true 120 FPS in b bgmi so all this episode got me interested and I wanted to test this phone more so we played four games here bgmi Cod mobile Cod war zone and genin impact for 45 minutes each on genin impact we played at high graphics 60 FPS and after playing it for continuously 45 minutes the temperature was somewhere around 34° and the battery consumed was 18% this slightly high considering delhi's cold next we allowed it to cool down and then we played Cod at 120 FPS and at the end we checked the temperature was good this was around 27° next we started off with Cod war zone in COD war zone we kept all the settings to high and the gameplay here was good for most of the time we were getting like 58 to 60 FPS but while playing this game I got this out of memory error and a few minutes later the game crashed and this happened again when I was testing it after 10 days it's very odd first phone that I have seen this error now again the battery consumed was about 18% which is slightly high considering that this is 6,000 MH now this high temperature performance issues they can be fixed with a software update but what further spoiled the experience is the cameras and the pictures from the camera are confusing like if you go through the main camera pictures it might seem what is wrong with it the skin tone or because of the sunlight it makes skin look flat now see this picture again we clicked using a telephoto the colors of the sky and even the skin tone looks very natural and even if you zoom in the details are good so rather than the main camera I was using the telephoto camera more because that's better and I took this phone to a marriage event through and through telephoto camera has better colors there's a huge difference in colors Plus in all the three lenses like ultra white Main and telephoto even in portrait mode sometimes it acts crazy like in this photo it has that yellowish tint going on whereas in this photo it looks so good and I took multiple photos through my 30-day experience results were the same that we saw on day one and how can we not talk about the zooms like it can go up to 20x the photo clicking experience in 20x Zoom is smooth so it t stable but the picture that you get at 20x is man also there's an ultra wideangle camera I almost forgot the pictures here are not that good great cuz it's an 8 map sensor on the front you get a 16 map selfie camera and selfies also lack that punchiness at times it's just hazy sometimes it's just flat on the front camera you can only shoot at 1080p 30 FPS like come on isn't this 2025 see the camera was something I wasn't expecting 13r to be that great but this is not even 40,000 camera performance also OnePlus now comes installed with the Oppo or color o App Store as of now there's not much notifications or pop-ups from it but I believe down the line OnePlus phones will have a bit of suggestions and popups here and there now coming to the most important question at 40,000 or with offers at 35,000 should you get the OnePlus 13r see if you want to game especially bgmi and gaming it's not that good here get IUN Neo 9 Pro or just wait for IUN Neo 10 Pro if you want good camera I think s23 or even iu2 in this price range is good but huh if you need an overall phone with really good o good day-to-day performance and good 3 to 4 years of updates OnePlus has good history for updates so so in those cases I believe this is the smartphone to get I still believe they purposely make the camera better on Flagship and not the r series because of course but I shared whatever we could and if you like more s 30-day long-term reviews let us do the smartphones we are trying to do more reviews and useful videos this year on that not this play signing off teiser PE see you pretty soon [Music]",2,The video primarily focuses on a detailed review of the OnePlus 13R smartphone

actually get in the Box alongside of course the nothing phone 3 a that's pretty threadbear stuff you get a little bit of chat from nothing you get the phone itself you get a USB cable although sans's transparent tips you do get we transparent pory SIM PIN jobby and that is basically your whack all right kitties let's begin as always with design got the regular nothing phone 3A here on the left the pro model on the right and the design is very different between the two although you wouldn't know it just by squinting at them from the front end the screen is nearly 6.8 in on both of these blowers while those bezels surrounding it aren't exactly super Slinky so you could certainly never accuse these smartphones of being compact frankly they're big enough to be used as King Kong's butt plug the nothing for 3A comes in a selection of white black or blue while the pro is only offered in Gray or black so if you'd like a bit of color in your life I'd go with the regular 3 a in this lovely deep blue hue get that stashed right in your pants and like the pro model you've got yourself in glass back on the regular 3A now rather than plastic in the previous generation and the regular 3A Sports once again that sort of dead eyed minion camera bump except now it's been extended a bit with a third eye added and that's compared with the pro model which hasn't so much got a camera bump as a camera tumor does come in quite handy as a bit of finger shelf action but it is rather ugly definitely prefer the overall Aesthetics and just general Vibe here on the regular nothing phone 3 a and while you don't have a bit of finger shelf action the edges of the phone are quite grippy so I haven't had any troubles fumbling this thing even after several pints of scotch my only real complaint is it's bloody massive and both three a blow is protected by a bit of panda glass up front which apparently is rather shatter resistant haven't personally tested that despite my best efforts to get absolutely obliterated these past few days you do have a pre-installed screen protector slapped on both these phones as well although as you can see on the 3A and the 3A Pro this is already starting to get scuffed up after just a couple of weeks and these phones are both ip64 rated as well so slightly more dust resistant than the previous generation although still not fully water resistant which in the case of the regular nothing phone 3A there's not many phones around that sort of price point that are but the good news is it can still tolerate a pretty severe springing so nor if you do live somewhere like blighty where you're constantly getting pissed on in a rain sense and also possibly in a piss sense welcome to the UK now the software set up on the nothing fun 3A and the 3A Pro is basically identical get yourself a tasty bit of nothing OS 3.1 slap there on top of Android 15 and nothing has pledged 3 years of OS updates for the nothing phone 3A so you covered up until Android 18 if my Superior math skills or anything to go by that's not one of the best efforts around but it's pretty decent and even better you get six full years of security patching how timely these security patches will be rolling in is another matter but at least you've got that guaranteed support and I have banged on about nothing os3 quite extensively in its own separate video so I won't Yammer on too much in this one but it's certainly one of my favorite launches out there I do really dig the fact that it's a mostly stock Android setup but with a bit more style sometimes it is a bit style heavy but I really like the dot matrix Shenanigans which carries through to nothing's own custom apps and nothing has slapped on a fresh shiny new feature in the essential space which is apply still a work in progress although it's really bloody good basically you can instantly capture any interest in content on the phone 3 a by porking the shiny new essential key or hold it down to record a voice memo at the same time then double tap that essential key to open the essential space which organizes all of that content in a rather smarty pant way I've already wanged on at Great length about essential space in my nothing phone 3A Pro review and because I'm a lazy git what can't be bother to repeat myself here I'm just going to basically just cut and paste that entire segment and slap it in here right now you're welcome the idea behind the essential space is it basically acts as a hub to gather together all the interesting and important content that you've gathered using that essential key so for instance I've spied a brewery that I want to check out when I'm over in Barcelona for mwc I can either tap that essential key just to take a quick screenshot of it you can also add a note down at the bottom here otherwise you can actually hold down that essential key to record a brief voice memo as well so visit this Brewery in Barcelona on Sunday evening then that's all immediately whisk off to the essential space you'll often have to wait anywhere between a few seconds and a minute for it to actually pop up as you can see right now it's busy processing the content just creating a summary and everything but here we are less than half a minute later we've got our entry enjoy your Excursion at garage beore give a little tap you've got the original screenshot in there which you can expand there's our head and visit Garage bayot in Barcelona Sunday evening it's got the location which we can tap in order to bring up in Google Maps we also got the original voice recording here visit this Brewery and Barcelona on Sunday evening but one of my favorite essential space features is it will automatically create tasks based on any captured content so as you can see there head to garage ble 700 p.m. 2nd of March the only problem is there doesn't seem to be any way of editing these tasks manually in order to change up the time for instance here I wanted to go at more like 400 p.m. rather than 7:00 p.m. which I almost certainly will you can sa book and reservations all kinds of stuff to this thing you can also summarize any text that you've CED Ed as well just some brief bullet points with the occasional bits of jun as normal and yes you can also capture content using the camera like so this is the nothing phone 3A Pro launching on Tuesday morning don't forget to edit and upload the video and you got a selection of three new widgets for essential space as well highlighting your recent capture an upcoming task that you've got on there otherwise you can have a list of your upcoming tasks which is the one that I've slapped on my desktop it's slightly annoying I can't re size the width of it but here I did have quite a few people asking me in the comments section of my 3E Pro review can you actually remap that button if you don't give a flying toss about essential space sadly the answer to that right now is no you can't hopefully that's something that nothing will add as a small Mercy in a future update my only real complaint is that occasionally I do accidentally knock that button by mistake when I'm pulling the phone out of my pocket although thankfully it's just enough of a separation from the power button I don't ever get those two mixed up and nothing hasn't tinkered with its glyph light and setup for the nothing phone 3A once again a triple light setup or Twilight I guess that sounds a bit too much like Twilight and now all I can picture is vampires rim and werewolves and as usual this can be used as a jazzy disco notifications light you've also got flipped to glyph support So lovingly layer the phone 3A on its face it'll go into Do Not Disturb mode and you'll only be notified of any messages it says the flash of the glyphs you can also use the glyphs as a timer and you've got the likes of the music visualization if you want a proper full-on disc or party and I that composer is back in Action as well so you can compose your own flashy ringtone type Shenanigans a couple of final points before we move off the software side of things sadly there is bugal eim support here on the nothing phone 3 a unlike the pro model and I am personally quite gutted about that because I do do quite a lot of traveling with work and everything and having the ability to slap on an eim when you go to America Canada places like that where you don't get the EU Raman is really really handy you can get some great deals make sure you're connected from the second you land if you don't do much traveling you probably won't really give a and also on the storage front you've got a choice of 128 or 256 gigs here if you do want 256 gigs that'll cost you an extra 50 Quid whereas the pro model at least comes with 256 gigs as standard and of course yes this bugger all micro SD support as if you even had to ask now movie fans should certainly appreciate the nothing fun 38 and it's whooping great 6.77 in flexible AMOLED display it's a full HD Plus resolution so not absolutely supremely crisp but still as sharp as you'll need certainly if you're just kicking back with some Telly shows or doing a little bit of photo editing or whatever it's mostly the same specs as before you got up to 120 HZ refresh rate support you do get the usual upgrade for this generation a slightly brighter panel still not the most powerfully bright screen out there but certainly strong enough so you don't immediately have to seek out shade when the sun does pop out and it's also great that nothing has taken on board feedback about the pwm demmon it's got 2160 HZ Dion this bad boy so better than some flagships out there which is great news if you are a bit more sensitive to OLED flicker in low light and you've also got yourself a respectable pair of stereo speakers here on the nothing phone 3A as well as usual wouldn't use it to actually listen to music or anything does the job absolutely fine for a bit of YouTube or whatever could use a bit more base bit more of a kick or whatever but you know it's fine just don't expect any Dolby Atmos support or any fancy pan Shenanigans like that now what's running the show well it's Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 s gen 3 exactly the same as the nothing phone 3A Pro although if you buy the base 28 gig model of the 3E you only get 8 gigs of ram my review model is the 256 gig version with 12 gigs of RAM and you know nothing OS nice and light so I've certainly found that zipping around in the UI pretty smooth smoother certainly than some more expensive Rivals like the Galaxy a56 occasionally the camera app can be a little bit lethargic when you're zipping between the different modes or swaping between the different lenses but honestly it's pretty good overall and if you're a gear well good news because the lacks of wether and waves gench and impact Etc do play quite nicely I smash my way through quite a lot of wether and waves on the nothing phone 3A it did get a little bit juddery every now and then especially if you D to boost the graphic settings above those medium E levels but it did run better overall than I expected and nothing has also increased the vapor chamber size over the previous generation and between that and that energy efficient qualcom Snapdragon chipset there's B basically sod all heat buildup here even after well over an hour of action the nothing fun 3A stayed cooler than a polar bears called bits and yes you do have a dedicated gaming mode which you can swipe out at any point like so this allows you to block all calls and notifications you could also record the action you got a performance mode which doesn't really seem to do too much but just helped to clear the memory a bit might come in more useful on that 8 gig model so yeah quite basic compared with the gaming modes that you'll find on some Rivals like from xiaomi or Poco for instance but you know better to have it than not basically and then on the battery front where you got a 5,000 Mah cell crammed into that rather chunky chassis and between that and again that energy efficient Snapdragon chipset that means you'll get all day play on this thing no worries whatsoever even with hours and hours of screen on time plenty of Spotify streaming in the background and plenty of camera play too certainly had absolutely zero battery anxiety when I was running around getting dozens and dozens of camera samples even doing a bit of gaming as well as long as you don't go fraking nuts and hey yeah it's exact same Battery tech as the pro model so not only the decent 5,000 milliamp capacity but also the 50 W wired charging so it doesn't take absolutely Rudy forever to power back up again although sadly like the pro sld all wireless charging support So as you'll hopefully have been able to tell if you've actually been paying attention and you not just skip straight TR to this bit is the nothing phone 3A and the nothing phone 3A Pro remarkably similar in most departments apart from when it comes to the camera Tech now you do once again have a 50 megapixel main shooter but it's using Samsung's gn9 DL sensor versus the pros larger Samsung g&j sensor and I have found in my time with these phones that the pro model tends to produce brighter more saturated shots versus the cheaper 3A most often when there's quite strong cont contrast you got more of an iphony kind of vibe overall which no doubt a lot of people will prefer that said a few of my 3E snaps fli the script just to be awkward while colors are Bal and pack a proper punch on both of these and both nothing blowers are solid enough for portrait shots as well although the pro seems to nail skin tones slightly more accurately the good news is despite the difference in sensor size the regular phone 3A is just as respectable for ambient snaps as the pro although when things get proper dim the pro model is slightly Superior especially when you're zooming in so what you've got here on the regular nothing phone 3A is a 50 megapixel Samsung gn5 telephoto shooter 50 mil equivalent with two times optical zoom and sadly bugger all Optical image stabilization and that's compared with the pros 50 meg Sony litier 900 sensor a 70 mil equivalent with three times optical zoom and this appears to to upgrade to ois as well now if you zoom in beyond the sort of four to five times level the difference is quite clear between this pair you'll get pleasingly crispy shots from the pro while things get a bit more hazy quite quickly on the regular 3A with a lack of finer detail and at night times you'll have to be extremely still with the 3A as that lack of optical image stabilization means you'll get blur with even the slightest hand Tremor and the 3A just like the pro packs the same 8m IMX 3 55 Ultra wide shooter with identical results no matter the time of day both are absolutely fine for a mid-ranger though TS do tend to get much warmer while low light results are a bit more murky and the nothing phone 3A boss the same overall enjoyable camera experience as the 3A Pro you can drag down a whole bunch of toggles the ability to bump up to a high res mode on demand you've also got a bunch of filters you can play around with otherwise you can add your own use an alert file and I bonus modes you'd expect to find on a modern mobile including bit of expert action if you want to Tinker around with likes of the iso levels the shutter speed Etc you can capture in raw if you like and for your whole movie type Shenanigans exactly the same again as the nothing phone 3 a pro you can shoot up to 4K resolution footage at 30 frames per second otherwise 1080p full HD footage at 30 or 60fps no major issues just like the pro stabilization is pretty respectable the audio pickup still quite clear even when things get a bit Gusty although in low light the 3A does once again stumble with some focal issues and rather murky visuals as for the selfie cams well it's a case of 32 Meg here on the nothing phone 3A versus 50 meg on the nothing phone 3A Pro the 3A you can still record up to full HD resolution footage at 30 or 60 frames per second there's no 4K option but the stabilization is pretty good the audio pickups absolutely fine so certainly find for all your video chat Shenanigans so there you have it my lovies that's why reckon of the nothing fun 3 a now should you buy this blower well I reckon it's pretty stunning value for money if you're looking for a mid-range mobile this offers the kinds of specs and features you'd get from phones 10000 more expensive than it I'd honestly bag this thing over an iPhone 16 e any fraking day of the week it is a chunky Moro no doubt about it absolutely Ruddy enormous but it's pretty much standard these days it's got some unique features in there like essential space and the glyph lighting of course that you won't find on other blows which I actually genuinely enjoy pretty bloody good battery life some decent performance even if you want to get gaming on this thing more than possible and some perfectly respectable camera Tech as well now should you upgrade to the pro model well it is quite a bit more expensive and for that you get design which frankly is a bit more poo and sure you got the Boost to the telephoto camera which is very nice in indeed but honestly I think the camera Tech here on the regular nothing phone 3 here will suit most people absolutely fine for me personally it's the lack of eim support on the nothing fun 3 here which would have me slightly hesitant and maybe thinking about upgrading to the pro but that's only because I have to bugger off abroad quite a bit for random TCH Shenanigans anyway now I'm just jabbering on that's what this Bal Northern twonk reckons but it' be great to hear your thoughts down in the comments below are you tempted by the 3A or do you reckon you might upgrade to the pro or can they both just get in the bin and then set the bin on fire and then catapult it into the North Sea let us know what you reckon down below please do pug subscribe ding that notifications Bell for more on the latest and greatest Tech and have yourselves an absolutely effing marvelous

360}}",,RvCwMskRZHc,1612,248497,en,RvCwMskRZHc,"RTX 590 laptop GPU thinner than ever finally using an AMD processor and great for your wallet wait this is Razer Blade 16 we're reviewing well three out of four ain't bad as always razer's blade 16 features their signature CNC aluminum chassis with anodized matte black finish this just makes the blade feel more premium compared to all other gaming laptops out there it's the closest to Windows gaming laptop comes to the solid build of Apple's Macbook so overall build quality feels great keyboard Flex is minor compared to most other laptops but there was a little more lid Flex compared to last year's blade I suspect they're using less metal as it's lighter but it doesn't really matter as the screen hardily moves when typing the hinges feel smooth and sturdy even when ripping the lid open way too hard there's a small indent on the front for getting your finger in to make opening easier and the screen goes back 135° standard stuff Razer says this blade is 30% smaller compared to last J coming in at just 14.9 mm at its thinnest point for comparison last year's blade 16 was almost 47% thicker When comparing the thinnest points the difference feels noticeable when holding both laptops the laptop itself weighs in at 4.6 lb or 2.1 kilos increasing to 6.4 lb or 2.9 kilos with a 280 W charger included this makes it one of the lightest 16 in gaming laptops we've ever tested it's beaten by the Asus sephus g16 which has also been refreshed with up to RTX 590 Graphics this year get subscribed for our review meanwhile last year's blade was 15% heavier than the 2025 model things are similar with the charger included there's a nice weight reduction compared to the last gen blade design but asus's g16 is certainly looking a fair bit more portable the new 280 W charger is actually slightly bigger physically compared to last year's 330 W charger they also stopped braiding the cable this year so it doesn't feel as fancy my configuration has amd's 12 cor Zen 5 processor nvidia's RTX 590 Graphics 32 gigs of RAM and a 16in QHD plus 240 HZ OLED screen but this is one of the top spec versions it's available with lower specs for less money when you customize it with the link below the video the keyboard gets a nice upgrade this year it's got 1.5 mm of key travel which Razer says is 50% more than before so basically the keys just feel nicer and deeper to press when typing it's still not my favorite laptop to type on but it is better now it's still got some of the nicest looking perky RGB lighting all keys and secondary functions get lit up but it's got jewal lighting now so if you hold the shift or function keys a second light shows you which keys can be interacted with the keyboard still has way too many brightness levels with the F10 and f11 shortcuts we measured 17 at 6% brightness increments which is just too many for a keyboard shortcut you can control it down to 1% increments in software which is great if still excessive but for keyboard shortcuts less is more so you don't have to spam the buttons to change it otherwise there are 11 different lighting effects available through Razor synup software with more customization available in the chroma software you can also control how keyboard and lid lighting behaves depending on whether the charger is connected or not there are five extra programmable macro keys on the far right side now they didn't get in my way but my partner said they made her miss the ENT key a few times because she expects it to be on the edge but then it's M3 instead so it might take some getting used to the power button is still close to delete and backspace but a short accidental press doesn't do anything you have to hold it for a little longer for it to put the laptop to sleep in action you can also change or stop in Windows anyway the glass touchpad isn't quite as large as last gen but it still feels massive it's super smooth clicks anywhere and generally works well but I had a problem with palm rejection sometimes when trying to click my palm might be barely touching the bottom corner of the touchpad causing undesirable results but at the same time I couldn't force it to happen on camera it just kind of happens sometimes end was annoying the blade 16 has six speakers now up from four last gen this includes two front-facing ones with the rest underneath there's a bit more bass and they sound a little clearer compared to last [Music] J the latencymon results weren't ideal but not completely terrible either the port layout is very similar to last J from the back the left side has the power input 2 USB 3.2 Gen 2 type A ports a USB 4 type c port and a 3.5 mm audio combo Jack the right side has a uh S2 SD card radar a little further to the back of this generation there's a USB 4 type-c and USB 3.2 Gen 2 type a port on this side too followed by HDMI 2.1 output and Kensington lock I like that there's type A and type c ports on both sides of the laptop and either type c Port can be used to charge the laptop with up to 100 wats as long long as you use a 20 volt charger both type-c ports also have display port 1.4 support for connecting a monitor but by default they both connect fire the AMD integrated Graphics before getting to the Nvidia Graphics so there'll be a slight performance hit when running games over type-c unless you force both type c ports to instead connect directly to the Nvidia discret Graphics through the BIOS HDMI always connects directly to the Nvidia graphics and we confirmed it could run out LG B9 TV at 4K 120 20 HZ 12bit width g-sync getting inside requires taking out 10 small tr5 screws all the same length I didn't need any tools to pry the bottom panel off but my kit does have the tr5 screw bit so I'll leave a link below if you're off good laptop opening tools inside we've got the battery down the front installed pcie Gen 4 m.2 SSD above on the right a secondary spare m.2 slot to the left of that and the Wi-Fi 7 card on the far right I confirmed both m.2 stage slots could fit my 4 TB drive with chips on both sides no problem this is an upgrade over last gen which had the two m.2 slots stacked on top of each other only allowing thinner drives the speeds from the installed 2 TB PCI Gen 4 m.2 Drive are great and that goes for the SD card slot too some good stuff here the card sticks out a little so be careful not to bump it Wi-Fi speed was decent basically matching ausa's smaller flow z13 with the same Media Tech card last year's blade performed better here with its Intel Wi-Fi card but at the end of the day this is still like 2 gbit probably plenty for most of you all right we need to talk about the ram situation unfortunately memory cannot be upgraded as it's on board with the CPU but that just seems to be the case for most laptops with amd's ryzen ai9 HX 370 processor it's not just some evil Ploy by a razor on the one hand yeah it kind of sucks that you can't upgrade the memory but on the other hand this allows for faster l P ddr5x 88000 speeds While most other gaming laptops max out at ddr5 6,400 or 5600 plus the blade is available with up to 64 gigs of memory which will likely be plenty for a lot of you in the US even the base model comes with a minimum of 32 gigs of RAM see you later 16 gigs of course it's not cheap but that's really good to have as the entry level given you can't upgrade later the lack of upgradeable memory is the reason why the upgrade score isn't as good as previous versions even razer's smaller blade 14 is better in that regard but it's worth pointing out that thinner laptops i' considered to be competition like ausa's zephrus g16 use the same processor and are also limited to no Ram upgrades this year's new 2025 blade 16 is powered by a 90w battery which is a little smaller compared to the 95w battery found in the bigger L gen version the battery refresh rate option is enabled by default which automatically lowers the screen's refresh rate to 60 HZ when you unplug the charger to save power and it goes back to 240 HZ when you plug back in you can also use the function plus r shortcut to manually swap between these refresh rates at any time you can enable the battery health Optimizer through the signup software to limit the maximum charge level of the battery between 50 and 80% which helps improve the longevity of the battery battery life is an area where Nvidia claims to have made some big improvements this generation and there's a 22% runtime Improvement compared to gaming on last year's blade despite last gen having a bigger battery though it's hard to say how much of this difference is purely due to the GPU the YouTube video playback test lasted a bit longer too but that one runs on the integrated Graphics instead and generally AMD processors are more power efficient than Intel in that test I'll also note that I didn't notice any major battery drain during testing despite the charger being 50 WS lower compared to last gen maybe a 1 to 2% loss after testing cyberpunk for an hour these new RTX 50 gaming laptops have an updated battery boost feature to improve the gaming experience when running on battery power basically instead of the FPS being locked at say 30 it'll run higher at 60 FPS while you're actively there playing a game but then if you stop for a bit and take a drink or have a snack or open something less demanding like a mini map or Quest menu the FPS will dip back down to 30 to help save battery we haven't tested that here as we're still trying to work out the best way to test that in a reproducible and fairly comparable manner but that is something new this generation let's check out thermals next we've still got two fans with the CPU and GPU covered by a vapor chamber cooler there's this thermal Hood area towards the back of the bottom panel which is a bit thicker to allow for more cooling space there are holes in the bottom panel above the fans for intake and air only gets exhausted down and out the b back so no hot air blowing on your mouse sound Razer synup software allows us to change between different performance modes which from lowest to highest are silent balanced performance and custom the new M4 shortcut key next to the right shift key can also be used to swap between them you can swap between Auto fan speed fixed fan speed or manual fan Curves in silent balanced and performance modes for some reason you can't customize the fans in custom mode despite it being called well custom custom mode also lets us set different CPU and GPU power levels but if you set the GPU to high the CPU maxes out at medium and vice versa we can also manually control the CPU power limit between 45 and 95 wats and there's also an option for CPU undervolting which can be used in any of the four performance modes but enabling it grze out the CPU power control the internal temperatures were cool at idle the rest of the results are from combined CPU and GPU stress tests which aim to represent a worst case full load scenario even in the worst case none of these temperatures are what I would classify as hot all internal temperatures were comfortably below 80° C with this workload there wasn't a noticeable Difference by closing the lid so no problem if you want to dock the laptop setting the fans to maximum lowered the temps a bit compared to Auto fans but as you'll hear soon they're louder to I'm swapping to the iets gt600 cooling pad in 2025 on onwards to better represent modern coolers compared to my older thermal take higher fan RPM results in low attempts but the fan noise also gets fairly loud at400 RPM and above undervolting the CPU resulted in slightly lower temperatures without negatively affecting the performance as seen in the clock speeds for the same tests the CPU is pretty much locked in at 2.6 GHz across all 12 C no matter what it only increases to just below 3 GHz if we use custom mode to set the CPU to high of course the compromise is the GPU gets limited to medium which is why its clock speed is now lower than most of the other results we can see this limits the GPU to around 129 Watts down from the 145 wats or so that performance and custom modes are otherwise able to sustain if whatever you're doing needs more CPU power than GPU power custom mode can help you out the Nvidia control panel says the RTX 509 in the blade 16 can run up to 175 Wat with Dynamic boost but with the CPU also loaded up at the same time we saw around 145 wats best case so not full power but also not bad considering the thinnest size of the laptop here's how the blade 16 performs in an actual game with a different performance modes I've got the native results without upscaling shown in purple and a demonstration of the performance Improvement that's possible by setting dlss 4 to balanced in red like we saw in the thermal tests in this workload it doesn't seem like it's worth messing around with custom mode as there's not a whole lot of difference to frame rates so it's no surprise that the CPU under volt didn't make a performance difference in this particular game where GPU bound at the native 2560 x600 resolution the CPU can use more power in a CPU only workload likes at a bench where the GPU is Idle there's basically no difference in single core performance in any of the modes we tested and multicore scores start seeing less gains with more power applied once we're already in performance mode undervolting the CPU by the maximum amount allowed in signups gave us almost the same performance but the CPU was running with 6 wat less power which should mean it's running a bit cooler too this is the best result we've had from amd's ryzen ai9 HX 370 processor so far both in single and multi-core performance granted it is also the heaviest of these laptops too so probably more cool in capacity too it's only clearly beaten by laptops with more cores and threads whether those be Intel or AMD based and this includes last year's blade which had more raw CPU power performance lowers if we unplug the charger and instead run off of battery power as it's limited to balanced mode there's quite a big dip in single core performance which isn't something we usually see from laptops with this or most other AMD processors but multicore performance is still higher most laptops I test are in the low 30° C range on the keyboard out idle and the blade was higher in the mid-30s in the center so just a little warm to the touch it gets warmer with the stress test running with the middle now in the mid-40s so still warm but not hot Balan mode was pretty similar the left and right sides are very cool as air comes in through the keyboard performance mode was similar with the middle of the keyboard in the mid4 40s it's warm but not uncomfortable and the WD area is very cool the keyboard temps are notably cooler in the center with the fans maxed out the back is still hot where air exhausts but you don't need to touch there the hottest point of the keyboard was definitely warmer compared to the last gen blade But Not only was the last gen blade a bigger laptop its fans were louder when running this test too so that's the compromise here's how the fan sound the fans was silent when doing nothing at idle they get louder with the stress test running with volume increasing in the higher modes as expected maxing them out is fairly loud but it's nowhere near as crazy as running the cooling powder at higher RPM it's definitely possible to get the temps even lower as we've seen it just depends on your tolerance to louder fanss but if you do prefer lower fan noise lower setting presets can still get decent frame rates in games all right let's talk about the OLED display on paper it's got the same specs as the last gen blade 16 but the panel model is slightly different and Delta e out of the box was great as it comes calibrated from the factory brightness is decent getting to around 400 nits at full brightness with a little brighter possible with HDR enabled this puts it in line with most other OLED panels that we've measured and within the margin of error range to the panel in last year's blade 16 in most cases you've got to go for mini LED if you want significantly brighter which was available last gen back lightly does not exist as black results in pixels being turned off the glossy panel looks nice but Reflections will get annoying if you're using the laptop in a bright environment and like other OLED panels pwm is used to adjust brightness which may be annoying for some plus there's always the possibility of OLED bur in over time though I haven't really heard of that happening in laptop considering they've been available for years now average greater gray screen response time was excellent at less than half a millisecond so it's super quick just like other OLED panels that we've tested they're all significantly faster compared to any other panel technology out there and ideal for competitive players the total system latency is the amount of time between a mouse click and when a gunshot fire appears on the screen in Counter-Strike 2 it's one of the fastest results compared to many other laptops and only beaten by liquid cooling of 490 so that's promising for these new RTX 50 laptops the blade 16 has advanced Optimus so you can swap between Optimus on or off without rebooting having Advanced Optimus means it must have a mck switch but the traditional Muk switch option isn't available through software so if you need that for some reason like changing the GPU the type-c port to connect to you'll have to go to the BIOS gsync is only available when Optimus is off but freesync is available from the integrated Graphics when Optimus is on there's a 1080p camera above the screen just like last gen and it still has a for Windows hello Face Unlock here's how the camera and microphones look and sound on the new Razer Blade 16 and this is what it sounds like while typing on the keyboard now for what you've all been waiting for let's see how the RTX 90 graphics and razor blade 16 Compares in games cyberpunk 2077 was tested with our own custom testron and I've got the blades 16 shown by the red highlight it's looking good for the RTX 590 if we start out with the highest resolution we test 4K sure it's only 4 FPS ahead of the best 490 result from last gen but if we actually compare it to razer's last gen blade 16 which was a bigger laptop we're seeing a 133% FPS Improvement the 590 in the blade wasn't able to maintain its chart topping result at 1440p it's still 10% faster compared to the last gen Blade with 490 and to be fair all the 49s beating it are in bigger and thicker laptops but still I was kind of hoping for more CPU performance matters more at low resolutions like 1080p with the 590 only using about 94 wats of power in this test as it's CPU limited down from 129 wats at 1440p and 150 wats at 4K this puts it at about the same performance as the blade 16 from 2 years ago so not much progress if your goal is low resolutions like this control is a GPU heavy game yet we didn't see it top the charts at 4K like we did in cyberp Punk yeah the dips in performance as measured by the 1% lows are better compared to last J but the average FPS from the 590 isn't really any different to those 490 results it's a very similar deal at 1440p which isn't surprising as 4K should be more GPU bound if the 590 was going to give us better performance we have already seen it and yet again same deal at 1080p the average FPS is much the same as last gen though it may be the newer Zen 5 processor significantly assisting with less dips and performance honestly the performance in our usual review games wasn't that impressive so I've also tested some newer games with rate racing and upscaling on the blade 16 with RTX 590 laptop graphics and the one from a couple of years ago with 490 laptop Graphics that's less than a 9% increase to average FPS at 1440p and 4K resolutions in Allan Wake too but the 1% lows are 40% higher with the 590 laptop which translates to a more stable smoother gaming experience hard to say how much of that is CPU change GPU change or faster memory but on the other hand cyberpunk 2077 with the rate racing Ultra preset was basically the same at 1440p and then only 3 FPS or 6% faster at 4K the 90 laptop was actually worse at 1080p presumably as the low resolution takes advantage of their extra CPU power in the older intel-based blade of course we could juice up those FPS numbers on the RTX 59 by using nvidia's New dlss multiframe Generation feature which does work all right as long as you've got a high enough base frame rate but I don't think that's a fair comparison unless also comparing visual quality which could be its own massive video I also need to note that I couldn't test our usual Red Dead Redemption 2 on this laptop because it kept crashing in the same part of the test every single time and this was a problem that Nvidia was able to replicate so presumably it will be fixed at some point we also had a few crashes in control but it was nowhere nearest consistent and that game did recently get its first major update in almost 4 years so the instability may not be specific to the 50 Series we'll need more time on that one anyway the 590 was only really able to beat the 490 at higher resolutions but ultimately the differences weren't really that big now this is a thinner laptop last year's thicker blade 16 with 490 Graphics was one of the lowest performing 490 laptops we tested all year and that was a bigger design than this one so I'm very interested to see how well the 590 can do in bigger laptops basically I'm trying to reserve judgment on the laptop 590 GPU until we get it in a few more machines and I've got plenty of big 20 plus game comparisons between the 590 580 570 TI and 570 against each other 40 series and desktop graphics cards so make sure that you're subscrib for all that upcoming content these are the highest 3D Mark results I've ever measured from any gaming laptop in the still Nomad Port Royal time spy graphics and fire strike Graphics tests so it definitely looks like the 590 laptop GPU can do better in GPU heavy synthetic workloads like these even when it's in a thinner laptop like the blade as for Content creation performance is okay but also we can't really properly test the 50 Series yet until newer versions of premere and resolve out of beta to take advantage of the new 422 10bit Hardware acceleration and extra encoders and decoders the BIOS still looks like it's old enough to drink but it's functional though there's not a whole lot of extra things to do in here that aren't also available in software Linux support was tested with an a bunto 24.10 live CD by default the keyboard touchpad Wi-Fi speakers and Camera all work keyboard shortcuts for adjusting volume keyboard lighting brightness and screen brightness all worked too a great result for new hardware pricing and availability will change over time so check the link below the video for updates and current sales and if the blade 16 does have a good sale we'll add it to the gaminglaptop dodeals website we update that every day to include all of the latest sales so make sure that you check it out regularly to save money on your next gaming laptop with that link below at the time of recording in late March the blade 16 starts at $3,000 for RTX 5070 TI graphics and it's a $500 extra to upgrade to the RTX 580 Graphics I haven't had chance to compare the 570 TI and 580 laptop gpus just yet but I will compare them in 20 plus games as soon as I can so again make sure you're subscribed the RTX 590 version of the blade 16 that we've looked at in this video costs ,000 more than the 580 version but it also bumps up the processor and doubles the SSD space we're talking about 4500 us for the configuration we're looking at here of course Razer gaming laptops have always been expensive when I reviewed last year's 490 Model A year ago it was $300 less for the RTX 490 and that had the same amount of RAM and SSD capacity so ultimately the question becomes is this year's newer model worth $300 more for the thinner design AMD processor faster but solded Ram better speakers better keyboard better battery life and RTX 590 Graphics I mean not that I'm looking to spend such a crazy amount of money on a gaming laptop but if I was that sort of customer already looking to spend 4 grand then yeah I think it makes sense to spend the extra $300 to get all those improvements of course that doesn't factor in sales that are likely to happen on the last gen blade 16 which are more likely to happen now that this is out I do think that the blade 16 itself is a much better gaming laptop this year except at the end of the day I didn't find a whole lot of major performance improvements with the new RTX 590 Graphics over the older 490 I'm a bit disappointed in the performance uplift in games if I'm being honest at least when not factoring in frame generation of course I suppose that's to be expected as this year's blade 16 is thinner too I guess we can't have everything but still the crazy high prices make it very difficult to justify unless you have a ton of money to spend and you want one of the best feeling gaming laptops razor laptops have always been expensive that's nothing new and the prices I'm showing in this video are early pre-order prices before any sales so you'll have to check for updates with those links below again this is the first RTX 50 gaming laptop we've reviewed we're going to cover plenty more this

tested all aspects of the phone impartially with controlling our excitement as well considering the price is fantastic and we tested it thoroughly in real world scenario and at the same time we've also compared the OnePlus 13r to the OnePlus 12 primarily because both of these phones have the same system on chip but most importantly to find out what kind of corner cuttings has OnePlus done to achieve this price on on the OnePlus 13r so let's get down to a detailed review of the OnePlus 13r and comparison against the OnePlus 12 of course we'll also talk about the OnePlus 12r along the way all right if you're here for the first time I'm Asad you're watching track and Tech English your destination for detailed incisive C reviews now first things first the OnePlus 13r has an upgraded RAM and storage variant for the base variant which is nice because now what you get is 12 256 GB by default it's lpddr 5x Ram type and ufs 4.0 storage which is also good because this year there's going to be no controversy around the fact that the base variant has ufs 3.1 storage so good job OnePlus now since the agent 3 has been there in the market for a while I expected the OnePlus 13 RS performance to be you know incredibly Superior compared to the OnePlus 12 but that's not really the case c92 we got the best score compared to OnePlus 12 so that's good but when you take a look at the gek Ben scores the OnePlus 12 scores slightly higher now when you look at the CPU stability score it's nearly identical on both which is evident from our test we ran it in performance mode one once and balanced mode once to just double check GPU stability score is also nearly identical that you can see from a 3D Mark while test test in fact the average FPS in our Solar Bay rate racing test was also nearly identical it doesn't really end there we also play gent impact for 30 minutes at highest graphics and 60 frames per second and the average FPS out there is nearly identical too except for the fact that the OnePlus 13r did get hotter than the OnePlus 12 but it's still within the limits of 42 43° which is not too bad so from our testing what it seems like is the performance tuning is Lar l l similar on both but what I actually expected is for the 13 art to be slightly better tweaked compared to the OnePlus 12 but that's not really the case uh and that seems like a bit of a let down to me maybe the engineers could have worked slightly harder to get more out of this setup by the way talking about being let down I'm also let down by the fact that many new viewers come and watch our videos of course I'm hoping that they're helpful for you but you know what will be even more helpful if you do like our videos don't forget to hit that subscribe button give us your support now the six MH silicon carbide battery inside the 13r is definitely impressive primarily because it's a very very compact phone but there's a catch here and it's some form of corner cutting as well because what OnePlus has done is that it has used a single cell battery instead of a split cell one and therefore the charging speeds was slower than what we expected it to be the 80 W Superbook charger took about 5 to 53 minutes for a full charge of the OnePlus 13r this is definitely a downgrade from the charging speeds of the OnePlus 12 which definitely has a smaller battery but but it's not too small it's a 5,400 M battery and the 100 wat charger can charge from 0 to 100 in 26 27 minutes the same is true for the OnePlus 12r as well so the charging speeds are down by half and of course the OnePlus 12 also has one ace up its sleeve and that is wireless charging but that I can live without on the OnePlus 13r but what I can't live without is faster charging speeds now the battery life itself has been you know fine I'd say because we're getting about 7 and 1 half hours to 8 hours of screen on time depending on you know heavy usage to moderate usage basically but it's still definitely slightly lower than what we achieved with the OnePlus 12 which could go up to like 8 and 1 half 9 hours depending on your usage in fact the oneus 12r is even better now talking about network connectivity both these phones have all the 5G bands that you would need to connect to a GE and even internationally so that's nice you also do get support for Wi-Fi 7 Bluetooth 5.4 and NFC all available by the way the beacon link feature which I talked about in the OnePlus 13 is also available with the OnePlus 13r so if you are somebody who likes using your phone like a walkie-talkie you can go ahead have fun with it another the 13r Chinese variant which was launched as the A5 in China actually had a macro camera but the 13r has a 2X telephoto instead which is definitely a good move by OnePlus now the primary camera of the 13r is a 50mp Sony lyt 700 sensor which is basically a rebranded version of the IMX 890 used in the 12r the secondary is the same 8mp Ultra wide angle camera that was there on the 12r as well whereas the telephoto camera the 2x telephoto is actually a Samsung gn5 50mp sensor which is not a bad sensor especially for a telephoto in this price class selfie camera is of course the same 69p camera that we had on the 12r now when you compare the specs of the 12 against the 13r obviously on paper the specs of the 12 are better now while the camera Hardware itself is one aspect of the equation the other part of the hardware is the S so which is of course Snap Dragon agent 3 and therefore the ISP is the same on both and therefore let's jump to the pictures to find out how the 13r cameras perform against the 1plus 12 so since the OnePlus 12 has a larger sensor it definitely captures sharper textures and more details compared to the OnePlus 13 R also when you look at the HDR tuning it's completely off on the 13r it is overprocessed and kills the contrast completely as well it's a very flat look OnePlus 12 in comparison has a more natural realistic look which doesn't seem overprocessed which is very nice talking about colors the 1 R color tuning in non HDR scenarios is kind of inconsistent sometimes you can get a shot that looks very good like this one here where the potato is not as warm as it is on the OnePlus 12 but in the very next shot the colors are slightly boosted on the OnePlus 13r to make the image look more attractive compared to the OnePlus 12 although it's not as offensive as the colors that were captured when we shot the HDR samples which is downright horrendous if you ask me sorry I just can't get over it it's very bad now skin tone rendition with the primary camera is not that great on both the OnePlus 12 tends to Output redish skin tones whereas the 13r over brightens the skin but the 13r colors are closer to what we saw in real life portrait at 1X is nearly identical in terms of edge cutout and boka drop off on both at 2x the 13r has captured more details thanks to the dedicated 2x lens and the image also has a very high contrast look that sort of makes it look good but the advantage with the OnePlus 12 is that it can go up to 3x which is of course not possible on the 13r having said that when shooting people the OnePlus 13r doesn't do that bad of a job it's actually pretty decent I like it also interestingly the 13 hour low light performance is better than what the OnePlus 12 does because what we noticed is you get crisper details the algorithm is sharpening slightly to make the details look better and you also get more details from the Shadows now this might come as a surprise to you but OnePlus 12 did crush the Shadows continues to crush the Shadows which the 13r doesn't because of the improved algorithm and I kind of like that Ultra on the OnePlus 12 on the other hand considering it as a larger sensor offers sharper textures and details in daylight in low light the 13r 8mp ultra wide does something very interesting where it uses the algorithm to sharpen textures slightly and therefore it doesn't look as bad as a soft images of the OnePlus 12 which is kind of odd because the OnePlus 12 has a 50 MP Ultra wide angle camera I expected it to do better now the zoom performance is of course better on the OnePlus 12 for sure granted at 2x the OnePlus 13r captures more details than the OnePlus 12 primarily because it has you know a better camera sensor the problem is when you zoom further ahead at 3x at 4X at 6X at 10x all of these Zoom ranges are definitely captured better by the OnePlus 12 having said that if you can spend some more money and buy the OnePlus 13 instead the zoom performance on that is vastly superior compared to both these phones selfies are clearly better on the OnePlus 12 especially in daylight the skin tones and details everything is just Superior even the selfie portraits are better on the OnePlus 12 however we didn't notice too many differences in the low light selfies but yeah OnePlus 12 takes better selfies in our opinion finally when it comes to video recording again the OnePlus 12 is better because it captures more details it has a wider dynamic range and more importantly the sound quality is better too this is the video sample shot using the OnePlus 12 and the OnePlus 13r this is the video sample shot using the one plus 12 and the 1plus 13 are in fact the OnePlus 12 can capture Dolby Vision videos using the 1X and 3X lens which is not possible on the 13r also the problem with the 13r is that it can't record 4K 60 FPS videos but only with the primary camera all the other cameras in the stack which includes the selfie the ultra wide the telephoto none of these capture 4K videos in fact they only capture 108p 30 FPS videos see the OnePlus 13 RS camera is definitely serviceable I would say that yeah I mean it's better at least it's better than the OnePlus 12r in my opinion but but the problem is that the camera is still its accul heal and it definitely doesn't feel Flagship level like the OnePlus 12 would and that is where OnePlus 12 has an advantage over the OnePlus 13 R Honestly though I feel like OnePlus could be deliberately nerfing the performance so that you know they can also sell OnePlus 12's in fact if you want the best cameras ever tuned on a OnePlus phone the OnePlus 13 is your best bet right now uh we have a detailed video a link should pop up right now go and check it it is compared to the io 13 in that video now if you take a look at the display specs of both these phones they're nearly identical except for three key differences firstly the OnePlus 12 and actually even the OnePlus 12r both these phones have a curved panel compared to the OnePlus 13r which has a flat one on the OnePlus 13r you also do not get Dolby Vision support in fact you do not get HDR support on Netflix at all so no HDR video playback is possible but with the OnePlus 12 you do get HDR and Dolby Vision support I feel like OnePlus shouldn't have skipped out on that feature now we did test out the HDR tuning side by side on both the OnePlus 12 and the OnePlus 13r and what we noticed is definitely that both are very similar in terms of the gradiation but the 1plus 12 is slightly ever so slightly better but here's something that's good about the OnePlus 13r and that it doesn't skip out on is the fact that you get 4,500 nits of peak brightness in HDR content and 1,600 nits of hbm peak brightness which is the same as the OnePlus 12 so no difference is there and therefore when you take both of these displays outside and view them under direct sunlight both are equally bright no problem there however there's one more Corner cutting that OnePlus has done and that is the fact that you do not get car glass wicus 2 which is there on the OnePlus 12 but it's also there on the OnePlus 12r on this phone it's the kic gorilla glass 7i we also noticed that the haptic feedback on OnePlus 12 is better than the OnePlus 13r for sure and since I think the OnePlus 12 has more room the speakers sound slightly roomier and you know they get louder compared to the 1plus 139 in fact why don't you take a listen to it for yourself and let me know what you guys think [Music] [Music] talking about speakers and multimedia experience you get support for all the you know high-risk Bluetooth codecs we did test it out lhdc ldac appex everything's available no problem there now one thing you must have noticed is that the design of the OnePlus 13r has been changed from the OnePlus 12r some like it in our office some hate it and I'm in the category where I'm like eh I'm ambivalent I don't have any feelings towards it it's nice but what I do like about the OnePlus 13 R's design is the functional improvements because it uses a denser battery and therefore the phone is much much Slimmer compared to the OnePlus 12 and the 1plus 12r also it's lighter compared to both these phones so therefore the inhand feel is much much better also your typical OnePlus features like the IR Blaster and the alert slider both are present on the OnePlus 13r as well but the one thing that the OnePlus 12 has and the OnePlus 13r doesn't is USB gen 3.2 which to me is committing harakiri because on a phone that is above 40,000 rupees it should have USB gen 3.2 not Gen 2 by the way if you're wondering what IP rating OnePlus 13 R has it has ip65 the same as the OnePlus 12 which is nice actually considering the fact that this is a more affordable phone but considering way more affordable phones under 20 under 30,000 rupes have ip68 rating some even have ip69 I think this one also could have gone with ip68 but I'm guessing that you know then that would be better than the OnePlus 12 which is something OnePlus wouldn't want right software has to be my favorite part of these two phones and especially a phone like the OnePlus 13r because at this price you get a very premium software experience with oxygen os5 obviously the first thing that anybody would notice are the improved animations you get parallel animations now and it's just tuned so well that it feels better than iOS if you ask me and you've got all of oxygen OS 15's features on the OnePlus 13r there is no gatekeeping here so everything is available so you get flux themes you also get live activities which is one of my favorite things with the OnePlus 13r because it definitely improves over iPhones live Activities The oplus Connect is also a very nice feature because then you can transfer photos from your 1plus 13 R to an iPhone easily that's open canvas there are AI features like AI detail boost Ai unblur and AI reflection eraser which is definitely my favorite by the way one thing I was definitely mention is that oxygen 15 experience on all the phones that we've tested till now including the OnePlus 12 13r and the 13 has been fantastic and very few bucks actually I didn't notice any buck as such as for software updates just like the OnePlus 13 the 13r is also getting four plus 6 years of software updates which is very very good so after using the OnePlus 13r what we felt is that it is a step up from the OnePlus 12r for sure especially when you take a look at you know the fact that you get a 2X telephoto camera you also do get a much much more powerful processor and it's Slimmer and lighter than the OnePlus 12r but it's not like a huge massive step up with you know very little corner cutting because there is Corner cutting that you guys have noticed throughout the video for example coring L 7i and the two reasons why I would recommend the OnePlus 13r to anyone is especially for the performance obviously because in this price range agent3 fantastic and the software experience which is very very good but if you're looking for something with great camera performance then I'm pretty certain that there will be phones that launch in this price category later with inferior processors of course which will be a better bet than the OnePlus 13r now comparing these two phones what I feel is that currently the OnePlus 12 is very very expensive but once the OnePlus 13 launch happens I'm pretty certain that OnePlus will have to drop the price of the OnePlus 12 if it wants to continue selling it now when that happens and if the OnePlus 12 comes to about like say 55,000 60,000 then definitely the OnePlus 12 will have advantages that make it more premium for example you get wireless charging and a better camera experience for sure and it just feels a lot more premium to use compared to the OnePlus 13r so that was my deduction of using the OnePlus 13r what do you guys think how do you like the OnePlus 13r do you like it a lot do you like it okay okay do you like it not at all let me know in the comment section below and I'll see you guys in the next one until then keep tracking and stay safe

mid-range Marvel Boston even spangli camera Tech the nothing phone 3A Pro will cost you 449 PS here and blighty bit of a price bump over the nothing phone 2 a plus but hey it's still 150 quid less than a certain retro brick that was launched last week and for that extra cash you get an upgraded camera setup with a periscope zoom lens as well as a couple of other Wei bonuses like a tasty bit of eim support so going to do a quick unboxing type situation with the two main colors of nothing phone 3A Pro then I'll slap my sim inside one of them and we'll stumble forward in time a few days to see what I reckon and for more on the latest and greatest Tech please do po subscribe and Hing that notifications Bell cheers so looks like your typical nothing box wee bit of jabber then you got the actual phone itself as well as a a tasty bit of type- C to type-c USB cable action though as you can see there you don't get the version with the transparent tips sad times but you have got yourself a transparent poy SIM PIN thing and of course the exact same Arrangement no matter your color choice and there we have the two highly thrilling color options gray or black I think I'm going to stick my Sim in the gray model purely cuz it'll be easier to film oo welcome to the Future and the world sadly hasn't ended yet yet so guess that means I've got to finish this video I found my Sim in the nothing phone 3A Pro for a good few days now so there's what I reckon so let's kick off with the design which has already been causing controversy well ahead of the nothing phone 3 a Pros launch because as usual of course they couldn't keep it in their pants had to flash it all over the socials ahead of the launch and as you can see things have changed up quite considerably compared with the old nothing phone 2A plus the overall Vibe is the same the 3A Pro was unmistakably a nothing phone with its transparent coat proudly shown off those internals but while the 2A plus sported quite a subtle Wii camera hilic that is absolutely sprouted on the 3A Pro to a honken great mountain range that's kind of a shame cuz I really liked the 2 a series with its deaded minion luck here on the 3 a pro it's certainly a bit more fullon fact it's just as huge as the likes of a xiaomi Ultra camera bump almost double the girth of this thing you know give it a chance the camera bump may not be aesthetically pleasing something not traditionally beautiful or anything but hey this is a near 6.8 in Whopper of a smartphone it's got a proper heft to it and everything as well so actually comes in really handy as a finger shelf if you are trying to actually desperately use this thing onehanded it does actually come in really handy as a finger shelf if you're desperately trying to use this thing onehanded now you got Panda glass up front on the nothing phone 38 Pro it's kind of similar to Gorilla Glass in that it's impact resistant though apparently not very scratch resistant so it's just as well that nothing has shoved a pre-installed screen protector on here just in case you may not get a bit of full-on metal edging but you got some nice grainy texture there and it's a matte finish so it doesn't pick up grubby prints or anything got a mixture of matte and glossy buttons and for the rear end nothing has opted for proper glass this time rather than the placky back we had in the previous generation we' also got some metal Des Design Elements including an aluminium frame for the camera bump I've somehow managed not to fumble and drop the nothing phone 38 Pro these last few days hopefully that back end will be shatter resistant like the front end so far touch but no scratches or Nicks anywhere on there and this phone is IP 64 rated versus ip54 in the previous generation so slightly more dust resistant although still not full-on water resistant can handle some severe spraying that's about it now when you want actually switch your nothing phone 3A Pro on you've got an indisplay optical fingerprint sensor and this has performed its Duty admirably these last few days nice and responsive as you can see there no hanging about the only issue is if your fingers are quite damp it'll obviously struggle to recognize you and a decent bit of face and lock in backup and then you're straight into a tasty bit of nothing OS 3.1 merily spattered all over Android 15 now you got a choice when you're setting up your nothing phone 3A for do you want to go with just a basic stock version of Android or do you want to go with the nothingi version which I've gone for I really like some of the nothing tweaks such as turning all of your app icons monochrome so they're less enticing you're not as easily distracted you can bring back those dot matrix headings for all of your settings and of course there's a decent selection of custom nothing widgets that you can slap on your desktops now includ a couple of fresh ones which I'll bang on about in a bit I've already done a full in-depth video on nothing OS version 3 all the different changes and everything it's got a very similar vibe to the older versions there a few new cool features and everything chucked in there and nothing is serving up three OS updates not too bad but you'll also get six full years of security patching as many as Samsung offers for its Galaxy a56 and almost a match for those pixels now one of the best new bits the nothing phone 3A Pro is the essential space which you can access by a quick double tap of the fresh new essential key here on the right Edge now this is still very much a work in progress apparently but nothing for 3 a and 3 a pro owners will get early access the idea behind the essential space is it basically acts as a hub to gather together all of the interes and and important content that you've gathered using that essential key so for instance I've spied a brewery that I want to check out when I'm over in Barcelona for mwc I can either tap that essential key just to take a quick screenshot of it you can also add a note down at the bottom here otherwise you actually hold down that essential key to record a brief voice memo as well so visit this Brewery in Barcelona on Sunday evening then that's all immediately whisked off to the essentials space you'll often have to wait anywhere between a few seconds and a minute for it to actually pop up as you can see right now it's busy processing the content just creating a summary and everything but here we are less than half a minute later we've got our entry enjoy your Excursion at garage beore give a look tap you've got the original screenshot in there which you can expand there's our head and visit Garage bayot in Barcelona Sunday evening it's got the location which we can tap in order to bring up in Google Maps we' also got the original voice recording here visit this Brewery in Barcelona on Sunday evening but one of my favorite essential space features is it will automatically create tasks based on any captured content so as you can see there head to garage vle 7:00 p.m. 2nd of March the only problem is there doesn't seem to be any way of Ed these tasks manually in order to change up the time for instance here I wanted to go at more like 400 p.m. rather than 7:00 p.m. which I almost certainly will you can save booking reservations all kinds of stuff to this thing you can also summarize any text that you've captured as well just some brief bullet points with the occasional bits of junk as normal and yes you can also capture content using the camera like so this is the nothing phone 3A Pro launching on Tuesday morning don't forget to edit and upload upload the video and you got a selection of three new widgets for essential space as well highlighting your recent capture an upcoming task that you've got on there otherwise you can have a list of your upcoming tasks which is the one that I've slapped on my desktop it's slightly annoying I can't resize the width of it but here are and yes of course the nothing phone 3A Pro once again sports that familiar flashy disco AR Shenanigans the triple glyph it's the exact same setup as the previous generation fully customizable of course a variety of different ring tones you can create your own you got good old flip to glyph so you can slap it face down you got a brief Flash and then all of your notifications will be silent got the glyph timer which again operates in exactly the same way just slap it face down this will slowly come down from your chosen time to zero and then give you a bit of a buzz and glyph progress is similar but for third party apps like uber zamato and the Google Calendar that's actually the only apps that Port it still right now and you can also get the glyphs to go absolutely mental give you a proper full-on flashy ass discore whenever you're playing some tunes as for the other features well it's great to see a bit of eim support here on the nothing phone 3A Pro which I believe is just for the pro only not on the regular nothing pH 3A and this bad boy also comes with 256 gigs of storage as standard and sadly that's not expandable via micro SD memory cards now the display slapped on the front end of the nothing phone 3A Pro is a 6.77 in Behemoth good bit of AMOLED action it's a full HD Plus resolution panel so visuals reasonably crispy despite the fact it's bloody massive no HDR stream and support reported in the likes of Netflix hopefully that will come because this phone is of course still pre-release at the time I'm shooting this video as you can see there the colors set to Alive by default which means they're quite Poppy and Punchy but you can reduce that to standard which to be honest doesn't make a massive amount of difference and of course tweak the old color temperature manually of course as we're seeing with a lot of smartphones these days the main upgrad for this generation is the brightness has been boosted a we bit the outdoor visibility is certainly absolutely fine on this thing nice strong viewing angles and everything as you'd expect refresh rate maxes out at 120 HZ and you've also got 2160 HZ pwm Dion just in case you are we bit sensitive to the old OLED Flicker and quite a cracken pair of stereo speak slapped on the nothing phone 3A Pro as well if you're after a smartphone with a camera that isn't total trouser well don't feel like you absolutely have to spunk out a grand or more on some of the latest snazziest flagships so pretty damn loud but no real Distortion or anything when you hit the maximum volume certainly fine for just kicking back with some YouTube or whatever as usual I'd say don't bother listening to music through there I've had absolutely bug all issues thankfully with the Bluetooth streaming because yeah sort all headphone jack on on this thing now performance comes courtesy of the Snapdragon 7s gen 3 same as what was stuffed inside of the redm note 14 Pro Plus which I recently reviewed and there's not much difference here architecturally at least to the mediatech dimensity 70350 pro which powered the old nothing phone 2A plus now of course everyday performance as smooth as you like and I did slap a good bit of we and waves on this bad boy even boosted the graphics up to the higher settings and you know what the nothing phone 3 Pro coped with it rather bloody well I was expecting to see a lot more jutters and drops in that frame rate than I actually experienced yeah the frame rate wasn't always particularly stable it was occasional bit of jerkiness and jankiness here and there but the game was still perfectly playable and of course you can just scale down the graphics settings if you do want a smoother experience you swipe out the old Gaming tool bar here on the nothing phone 3A Pro you got a performance mode that doesn't seem to do a huge amount but it's nice to I guess a few other way features like notifications blocking Etc as well quite basic compared with some gaming toolbars but you got the main stuff in there and the good news is that even after well over an hour of weather and waves action the nothing phone 3A Pro didn't start to feel particularly toasty you got a bigger Vapor chamber than the previous generation stuffed in here so that'll help to keep things nice and cool and of course Snapdragon 7s gen 3 pretty energy efficient anyway and shunted inside of that big old chunky chassis you've got a 5,000 mAh battery same capacity as the regular 3A and on one of my sort of regular days with roughly 6ish hours of screen on time plenty of messaging bit of video streaming and lots of audio streaming mostly music occasional bit of podcast when the phone is hibernating I found the nothing phone 3A Pro still comfortably lasted until I was all tucked up with Teddy I still end most ear with roughly 20 to 30% battery life still in the tank despite the fact that Spotify seemed to drain it fairly heavily however on the one day this week when I played WEA and waves for well over an hour to test out the game and chops and everything that absolutely mullered the battery so it did hit 0% I think it was around half 9 10:00 at night so you know regular users shouldn't have any issues whatsoever but more demanding heavy users might struggle to make it through a full day on a single charge of course just early Impressions I've only had this thing stuffed on my shorts for a few days now hopefully the situation will improve once it's properly beded in and hey slight upgrade for the charging speeds as well now boosted to 50 W wired chargings pretty nippy when you do bung a cable in it but still sadly bugger all wireless charging for the nothing phone 3A Pro and he let's finish off this delightful Wii unboxing and review of the nothing phone 3A Pro with a squint at the Optics and this here is of course the main difference between the nothing phone 3A and the nothing phone 3A Pro it's your usual nothing camera app pretty easy to get to grips with and quite easy to use onehanded as well the nothing phone 3A Pro Sports a 50 meg Samsung G&G sensor you've also got yourself a 50 meg Periscope shooter using Sony's litier 900 sensor so 70 mil equivalent with three times optical zoom and then last up is a pretty basic 8 megapixel Sony IMX 355 Ultra wide angle shooter and in my time so far with the nothing phone 3A Pro I found the camera to be pretty sponsor you can fast tap that shutter Button as you can see there and swaping between the different lenses is reasonably nippy as well now nothing has apparently tweaked the ultra xdr smarts which captures eight raw images and then combines them into one bright and bold snap it's certainly more of an iphony Samsung e Vibe whenever you've got high contrast pics with the same saturation as a result of course most people seem to get all hot and bothered about that you'll suddenly notice plenty of finer detail packed into the marker sections as promised although the usual softness will set in with more ambient light flick to portrait mode and the phone swaps to that three times Periscope shooter but you can switch back to the main sensor if you want to pull back a bit any motion will leave you with a blurry snap especially if you're not shooting in strong light but if your subject manages to keep quite still the nothing phone 3A Pro proves quite a decent Wii shooter for spaffing out portrait picks with an ey pleasing Bokey style finish and having a zoom lens is pretty rare for the 450 price point and it's pretty decent effort on the nothing phone 3A Pro as well even at night the results on a total poot sack of Guff and while this comes in most handy for portrait shots it can happily be used to crop in when needed maxing out at 60 times total Zoom with a bit of digital assistance and that Ultra wide shooter ain't too bad either or detail levels do take a bit of a spanking as does the overall tonal accuracy you could also your own filter here on the nothing phone 3A Pro by importing a lookup table or lot for short but of course there's plenty of pre-installed filters on here by default as usual if you want to shoot a bit of home movie action well as you can see there you can capture up to 4K resolution footage but if you want to swap up to 60 frames per second you will have to knock it down to full HD it's only 4K 30 FPS here including the usual funky Randomness and the nothing phone 3A Pro is kind of fine when it comes to video no major issues stabilization is respectable audio pickup still quite clear even when things get a bit Gusty and allegedly there's been some night video enhancements although those visuals are still rather murky in low light and the focus can struggle to keep up and finally slapped on the front end of the nothing phone 3A Pro you've got yourself a 50 megapixel selfie shooter again slight upgrade of the original nothing phone 3 a this can again capture 4K footage at 30 frames per second if that's your bag stabilization pretty good the audio pickups absolutely fine so no real complaints and there you have it my lovelies that and a tasty wi nutshell is the fresh new nothing phone 3A Pro now the major difference between the pro model and the regular nothing phone 3A is that camera Tech I have got the 3A as well I've done a short unboxing of that so you can check that out for a bit more not bad boy I am hoping to fully review the standard nothing phone 38 and compare with the pro as well at some point cuz is considerably cheaper than this bad boy over 100 quid less but all the same 450 quid buys you an awful lot of phone here I've really enjoyed my week with the nothing phone 3A Pro nothing still enjoyably unique and of course I was pretty skeptical about the whole essential space thing whe whether it was actually going to be a worthwhile addition but I found myself using it quite a bit this past week so intrigued to see where they take that it's kind of like the old action button on the iPhones except they've actually put some proper thought into it and made it much more than just a crappy shortcut button got a respectable camera setup around this sort of price point performance has been slick battery life not as good as some alternative options out there but not terrible anyway that's what this folically challenged palad northerner reckons but what do you think of the nothing phone 3A Pro does it really Sizzle your sausage definitely let us know what you think down in the comments below please do pug subscribe and Di that notifications Bell for more on the latest and greatest Tech lots more mid-rangers coming at you I only just did a couple of videos on the good old Samsung Galaxy a56 as well a strong rival in the meantime have yourselves a ruddy wonderful rest of the week cheers everyone love you [Music]",1,The video is a straightforward unboxing and review of the Nothing Phone 3A Pro

It's a 13inch Android tablet that's premiumish and starts from a not too horrendously wallet driven 649 quid. You can also grab it in a nonplus version which is slightly smaller and a wee bit cheaper. But should you grab the Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus over the likes of the OnePlus pad 2 or those Xiaomi efforts? Well, here's my full review. And for more on the latest and greatest tech, please do p subscribe and ding that notifications bell. Cheers. Now, first up, as you can probably ascertain from the general skinniness of the box, there's not a huge amount packed in here besides, of course, the Galaxy Tab. You've got yourself the usual USB cable shenanigans, type-C to type-C. Samsung has still chucked in its S. Samsung has still chucked in its S Pen stylus, and you got a quick start guide. And that's it. No keyboard cover or even just a regular cover, but it's great to have that stylus still packed in there at least. All right, so the Tab S10 FE Plus is a bit of a beast at 13.1 in. Should be enough to satisfy anyone, your mum included. You've got even bezels on all sides, not particularly thick, just thick enough, in fact, to ensure that it's reasonably comfortable to clutch one-handed. But be careful cuz if your thumb strays even slightly onto that page, immediate response. And of course, you will get tablets out there which have skinnier bezels which don't respond when your thumb's just slightly straight onto that screen. But at least there's no silly notch action or anything here. And this tablet is pleasingly skinny as well. Only slightly thicker than the Ultra at around 6 mm. Although it does also weigh 664 g, so it is a bit of a heer. And certainly after an hour or so of clutching this thing, starting to feel a bit of arm fatigue. Although I'm hardly as built like Jason Mamoa, more like Jason Bradbury. You know, just as much bloody hair. But the Tab S10 FE Plus certainly still has a premium vibe to it as you'd expect at this sort of price. You got a lovely metal frame which stretches all the way around the back end as well. It's a matte finish of course or deals pretty well with fingerprints. But as you can see that does get quite grubby once it's been handled for a few days which I of course deliberately didn't clean off just so I could show you lovely fork at home. You got Samsung's usual design which is the tablet equivalent of a short back and sides just you know smart if not particularly sexy. You got a choice of three colors gray, silver or blue. One of the best parts of the design is you got full IP68 water and dust resistance. So, this thing can be dunked fully in water. You can drop it in a bath, take it in the shower, whatever you fancy. Uh, no worries. Of course, what you're doing with the tablet in the shower is your business. No judgment here. Now, to unlock the Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus, you've got a fingerprint sensor built into that incredibly skinny power button. But despite that slender design, it works an absolute charm. I can't remember this thing feeling on me once. It doesn't seem to matter which angle I attack it from. Just works every time and you're straight into your desktops as well. Nice and quick. And then bug roll surprises once you have unlocked the Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus. It's once again good old 1 UI5. Absolutely packed full of Samsung's own apps and services which are of course duplicates of a lot of the Android stuff. And it's the same general UI as what you'll get on the likes of the Galaxy S25 series smartphones. So now drag down from the right hand side to get the control center, left hand side for the notifications. You can stick this back to the old way of doing things if you want to. You got the exact same customization for the home screen, the lock screen, etc. So if you've got a Samsung Galaxy smartphone stuffed in your pants or purse or whatever, you'll be right at home here. And the great news is Samsung is generously offering a full 6 years of OS updates and security patching with the Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus. So, exactly the same as with those fresh new A series mid-range phones. In less great news, Samsung has packed a measly 128 gigs of storage into this tablet. This is upgradeable to 256 gigs, but at a price of course, but you do at least get micro SD memory card support on here, up to 2 TB in total. And my review model is Wi-Fi only, but you can upgrade to a bit of sub6 5G action if you want to stay connected wherever you roam. And apparently that will support physical SIM as well as eSIM. But of course, Samsung has tweaked 1 UI, so it's a bit more tablet friendly here. So for instance, if you swipe up from the bottom with two fingers, you can quickly and easily jump into a bit of split screen action. And likewise, if you were to swipe with two fingers from the side, it will split it vertically rather than horizontally. So quickly and easily to jump into having two apps running side by side. And once again, there's full support for split screening with any app on there, even if it's not typically supported. Otherwise, alternatively, of course, you've got the usual bit of dock action. So you can once again just grab an app and drag it onto the screen wherever you want it, including having it in a bit of a floating window. It's especially good if you want to enjoy a wee bit of YouTube, Netflix, whatever, while also getting on with other stuff. And in total, you can get up to three apps running side by side like so. Plus a floating window as well. So, it's just as well you've got this who great 13in display. And naturally, I have seen a wee bit of junk these past few days with the Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus. Occasionally, for instance, the network will just completely drop on it. Even though it's connected to my Wi-Fi, it'll say no internet connection, even though other devices that are connected to the exact same Wi-Fi are doing absolutely bloody fine. And also, the reorientation is rather annoying. So, I've got all my icons spread along the bottom row here when it's in landscape mode. But if we stick it in portrait, they all jump right up to the top end for some reason. I've got no idea why. Not sure how to correct that. Oh, there we go. There's my thumb intruding on the screen again, which actually quite conveniently brings us in a neatish sort of fashion onto the good old AI shenanigans. And if you'd rather snog Rottweiler than hear yet another tech YouTube banging on about AI, well, you might want to skip forward about a minute or two. But yeah, you got all the usual Samsung AI features banged on here, including good old AI select. do a bit of all this and quickly set something as your wallpaper or create a GIF out of it. For instance, GIF, GIF, however you're supposed to bloody say it. You jump on into Samsung's web browser, you can have a web page read to you. What's interesting about Woody is that a more apt description of the music is melodic death metal. It's not exactly the most natural human style reason, but there if you want it. But of course, as always, the most useful AI features are to do with editing photos. So you can erase any background stragglers. You can quickly get rid of shadows for instance, which as you can see there, you don't always get the result you want, but it works pretty well. I managed to get rid of my baldy head, which was the main thing. And yes, you've got that bundled S Pen, of course, to get all scribbly and sketchy should you so desire. So you can take a screenshot at any point and scribble away on it, edit documents, etc. In fact, it's signing NDAs and baros, things like that, which is where I actually use the S Pen. I certainly don't do any drawing with it because I have absolutely zero creative ability which you'll know if you've watched any of my videos like you are right now. If you dive on into the advanced features in the settings menu, there is an S Pen section in there. So, you can slightly customize it with the likes of the Air View. However, if you do want the Air actions where you'll have to upgrade to the S Pen Pro, unfortunately, no support for that in the bundled regular bog standard S Pen. And then when you're done with the S Pen, you want to tuck it away somewhere. Well, there's no orifice to bung it in. Sadly, cuz the stylus is actually slightly thicker than the tablet itself. You don't even get a little groove on the back end that you can slip it into like you do with those more premium Galaxy tablets. Unfortunately, is that there is a magnetic connection, but it's kind of a bit wishy-washy. It just sits there on the back end, and it's all too easy to accidentally nudge it and knock it flying. Of course, it's going to stay on there perfectly well now, isn't it? see flimsy. And there's the usual optional keyboard cover shenanigans as well, but Samsung didn't send that to me, so I can't bang on about it, which probably comes as something of a relief. Now, the 13.1 in screen that Samsung has slapped on the front end of the Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus is a basic LCD panel rather than Sami's own dynamic AMOLED tech. And this is a real shame because it means you don't get the gorgeous crispy contrast of some of those more premium Samsung tabs. Although the visuals aren't bad by any means, the contrast still respectable even if you don't get proper fullon deep blacks. Colors are still reasonably poppy. You've got 2880 by 1800 pixel resolution which keeps the visuals finely detailed despite the enormous wanging great size of this tablet. Viewing angles are perfectly fine and the screen is just about bright enough on the maximum levels to use outdoors, although I was struggling to see what was going on in slightly murkier scenes in the likes of Halo, Devil May Cry, etc. And you got those usual eye comfort shenanigans slapped on here as well, which just filters the blue light, makes everything nice and warm and easy on the eye if you are using this tablet in low light. And as it's not OLED tech, at least you shouldn't have any issues with flickering, etc. if you're more sensitive to that. And it's 90 Hz refresh support on here as well. Doesn't always feel it, although that's more down to one UI than the actual screen. And while you don't get a quad speaker setup like those more expensive premium Samsung tablets, the dual speaker stereo setup here is absolutely fine. Still powerfully loud when you max it out. It will easily fill a small room with sound, no problems. You can clearly hear what's going on even in quite a noisy environment. Now, as for the performance, well, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus is powered by the same Excynus 1580 chipset that was stuffed inside of the Galaxy A56 5G mid-ranger. And that's backed by either 8 or 12 gigs of RAM. My review model came with the Masley 8. And the everyday performance here is absolutely fine. As I say, you can run three or four apps side by side at the same time and generally not see much in the way of slowdown. Although 1 UI can occasionally be a bit juggery, but to truly test the performance, as always, I slapped a good bit of weather and waves on here. Boosted the graphics settings up to the higher levels, and yes, just like the Galaxy A56 phone, I did see that frame rate drop fairly regularly. Quite a few stumbles here and there, especially when things got a bit aggro and a massive off bear or wolf or whatever suddenly decided it wanted to eat my head. The screen sensitivity wasn't fantastic either, but of course, playing a game like Weather and Waves, just using the touchscreen controls, not ideal. So, that's more on me to be fair. But anyway, drop the graphical settings down to the more sort of regular medium to low levels, and you'll get a more stable frame rate. And also, I had absolutely zero heat issues here. Galaxy Tab didn't start to get toasty even if I was gaming for a good hour or so. And Samsung has also shoved a single 12 megapixel camera on the front end of this Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus. This is absolutely fine for your video chat shenanigans. I've had and absolutely zero complaints from anyone I've been skyping or teamsing with. As you can see, effortlessly handles strong contrast from bit of window-based backlighting or indeed massive bloody studio lights. You can record up to 4K resolution video on this thing as well if you fancy doing that. And you've also got yourself a dinky 13 megapixel rear camera stuffed away in a corner of the Galaxy Tab. Absolutely bug roll idea why. There must be some reason for having a camera slapped on a back end of a massive great honking 13-in tablet, but if there is, I can't bloody see it. And finally for this Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus review, the battery life. And what you've got stuffed inside of this slender chassis is a just over 10,000 mAh capacity cell. And as usual, this really delivers. So with mixed use, including a good bit of split screen action, plenty of audio streaming, web browsing, etc., etc., you'll get well over a dozen hours of action from a charge. It's enough to keep you going all day basically. And if all you're doing is streaming video on this thing, it'll happily last around 1920 hours. It's only if you're doing something like video chatting or gaming on this thing that you'll kill it fairly quickly. playing the likes of bother and waves for instance with the higher graphics settings and in that performance mode it lasted around 4 and 1/2 hours on a full charge and if it does need juice and backup again where you got 45 watt wired charge and the same as the Galaxy S25 Ultra which you know it's fine for a phone but something with double the battery capacity it does take a wee while to charge back up again so certainly don't forget if you're about to head off on that road trip or whatever don't want a bunch of pissed off kids sat behind you for several hours. And there you have it, my lovelies. That in a tasty wee nutshell is Samsung's fresh new Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus. I got to say it's still not particularly cheap at this sort of price point. I'd be more swayed by the likes of the OnePlus Pad 2, which right now you can pick up for a couple hundred quid less, especially as I generally just prefer Color OS. I think if Sammy had slapped one of their gorgeous AMOLED panels on here, I'd be a bit more swayed. But, you know, it's an enjoyable enough everyday tablet. Nice and skinny. If not particularly light, great battery life, okay performance, just, you know, if you are gaming, you might want to upgrade. Anyway, I've banged on long enough now. Thank you very much for watching this review to the bitter end kitties. Please do let us know what you think of the Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus in the commenty bit down below. And please do, did I already say poke subscribe and stuff? Sorry, my brain is just melting out of my ears today. book subscribe, ding that notifications bell, and have yourselves a ruddy, wonderful rest of the week. Cheers everybody. I love you.

will drop faster than Bruno Fernandez in The Penalty Box but fear not for an alternative Ultra phone has just launched which won't absolutely slap your wallet right in the happy sack this here Poco F7 Ultra which just happens to be Paco's first ever Ultra blower is here to flip some tables as well as expectations it's the most expensive model in the new Poco F7 family and indeed the most expensive Poco smartphone to date but it's still considerably cheaper than those Samsung and xiaomi shaped Rivals but is it actually worthy of that Ultra moniker or should you spunk up twice as much cash for this pair well there's my full Poco F7 Ultra review and for more on the latest and greatest Tech please do po subscribe and ding that notifications Bell cheers now I've got to admit if you just handed me this Smartphone in the street and asked me what I thought of it well first of all my natural inclination would be to pocket the phone punch you in the face and then leg it off down the street as I am from Sunland after all but I certainly wouldn't have guessed that this is a more premium device it certainly doesn't look very Ultra that's for sure and first up you've got a completely flat display here on the Poco F7 Ultra which compare and contrasts that with the xiaomi 15 Ultra and other flagships which have this I believe it's called a Jew drop design or something Pony like that basically where they screen subtly curves on all four edges and certainly does give a more premium Vibe Al though don't get me wrong I am perfectly happy with a completely flat finish here on the Poco F7 ultd certainly good from a usability standpoint and this also gives the impression that those bezels surrounding the screen are a wee bit chunkier but they're actually still pretty skinny you do have a metal frame it's the least you'd expect on a phone that calls itself Ultra and then that R end is quite tidy if not particularly St in with a combo glossy and matte design I think functional is how I would describe it it's quite good you've got this matte finish down below cuz at least then when you're clutching the PCO F7 Ultra it's not getting basted in Greasy nasty fingerprints stays pleasingly smudge free unless you to be working your way through a bucket of chicken tenders or a late night Friday Donna special uh PCO is offering the F7 Ultra in a choice of two colors you got this here black effort which doesn't really have much gold on otherwise Poo's usual bright yellow Shenanigans if you can tolerate I'd certainly say the yellow model has a lot more G on this black effort in comparison is just rather Bland not that Samsung's Galaxy s25 Ultra is any more thrilling of course but I do really like the finish on xiaomi's 15 Ultra another two torn effort and an absolute stunner of course one good thing about the Poco F7 ultra's design is at least that camera bumper shrunk right down compared with the xiaomi it's no longer the size of Godzilla's sphincter in fact poco's camera bump is almost quite cute but it does still stick out a fair bit from the AR end of this phone I'm quite happy with that situation cuz the PCO F7 Ultra is quite a slippery Smartphone when you are using it one-handed there's not much grip so that camera bump acts as a sort of Handy finger shelf helps to keep your grip a bit more secure it's a bit of that shield glass protectant at the front end you do have a pre-installed screen protector on top of that as well whereas around back I believe it's just regular glass but certainly after a good few days of using this thing there's not a single scratch of scuff on there less durable smartphones tend to pick up Wii scars down here at the bottom end of the phone even after just a week or so but touchwood no such issues here it's also ip68 water and dust resistance so no stress if you have sat in the bath lounging by the pool whatever you get up to now as you'd expect from Ultra branded smartphone the Poco F7 Ultra Sports an ultra Sonic in display fingerprint sensor not a bug Standard Optical effort and absolutely zero buggering about just tap your thumb to that sensor and as you can see you're instantly into the PCO F7 Ultra even if your hands are quite wet a little bit greasy again from those chicken tenders the fingerprint sensor rarely rarely fails and you got a good bit of face unlockers back up too and then once you're in there of course it is naturally a good bit of hyper OS 2 slapped on top of Android 15 the same as what you'll find on the xiaomi 15 Ultra and the good news is as well the Poco F7 Ultra will re will receive four OS updates and six years of security patching as well not quite as good as again some of the other Ultra Rivals lik the Galaxy s25 Ultra of course it's 7even years of support but still pretty decent for a mid-ranger I can't really complain with that even if it isn't quite Ultra level and yes like all other hypos devices even the xiaomi 15 Ultra you do get some crapware bunged on here the likes of AliExpress booking.com Facebook LinkedIn all the usual bollocks that you'll have to remove from your smartphone just to tidy it the hell up and like both of those other Ultra branded smartphones from 2025 you've got duplication of services as well as you got another app store you got another web browser and yes the odd we spot of bulky Behavior here and there as well although I will point out the PO S7 Ultra is pre-launch right now so hopefully a lot of these little quirks and bugs will be sorted out in time for the UK retail release and some of these problems I saw on the xiaomi 15 Ultra as well including a notifications panel you can't actually read if you're using a light colored background or an app with a light colored background which is really helpful but while it's not always particularly user friendly at least hyper os does allow you to deeply customize your smartphone got a decent selection of always on displays to choose between you can piddle about with the icons the fingerprint effects change up the animation there and you got a decent selection of online themes to download as well including some nerdy anime efforts which means I immediately of course adore it and for the storage here on the Poco F7 Ultra you got a choice of 256 or 52 gigs which is you know the least I'd expect from an ultra branded smartphone there's no one terabyte option like there is on some the ultra blowers but at least it doesn't start off at a piddly 128 especially as this bug roll micro SD memory card support here and the really good news is poco will only charge you 50 pounds to boost that storage to the 512 gig Max model and compare that to the leg a bloody Apple it will charge you 100 quid for the privilege however unlike other Ultra phones the Poco F7 Ultra does not offer eim support you've got space in that Sim Traer to two sims but bug all eim action on here which I would expect that from an ultra 4 that's a strange emission and don't worry I'm not going to bang on about AI Shenanigans at Great length in this video but xiaomi does have its hyper AI stuff on board and yes this does include the usual complement of tools to translate summarize it's all the same stuff we saw in the xiaomi 15 Ultra so for instance you've got live subtitling which seems to work with anything with audio although as usual struggles a bit with my general northernness you got the usual writing Guff that can spruce up your messages to make you sound less like a pleb and more like an utter and then of course most of the stuff that you'll find on the other Ultra phones that people will actually use like Circle to search pretty damn convenient and of course those photo editing tools and frankly it's kind of insane just how good some of these are like they can literally just wipe a whole bunch of people in central London out of existence this can also help to sort out those miserable murky gray British Skies make it look like you're actually I don't know somewhere abroad where they have you know proper weather and stuff now the Poco F7 Ultra Rox a 6.67 in super crispy 1440p AMOLED display it's pretty much the same Tech as what you found slapped on last year's Poco F6 Pro those to take full advantage of those supremely sharp visuals you will have to activate the wqhd plus mode in the display settings and this panel is almost as Posh as you would hope from an ultra you've got full HDR 10 and Dolby Vision streaming on board here works perfectly in streaming services like Netflix you can expect gorgeous contrast and you've got an impressive selection of color options to play around with as well if you're not a fan of the regular display modes including a good bit of P3 and srgb action and the screen hits around 1,800 knits on the high brightness mod so the clarity stays strong even in pretty full-on daylight while the L's brightness setting is perfectly comfortable for low light viewing and you've also got 3840 HZ pwm Demming as well as the usual ambient mods to further rest your peepers our refresh rate Peaks at 120 HZ for supported apps and games again the minimum you'd expect even from quite Budgy Android phones these days it's just the bloody iPhones that aren't capable of that but unfortunately it's not ltp o Tech the refresh rate con dip as low as a single Hertz when it's displaying static images or just something like the always on display in order to preserve a bit of battery power and the Parco F7 Ultra also supports a proper beef tastic pair of stereo speakers absolutely assaulting your air drums with proper loud audio when you Peak that volume but the clarity is still pretty solid even when you do max out that volume so a banging bit of audio action and you got full support here for appex adaptive HD and lossless as well if you're doing a good bit of Bluetooth streaming as long as you got the right gear that is I've been testing the Poco F7 Ultra out with the xiaomi buds 5 Pro enjoying a good bit of that highres audio proper Lush but what actually Powers the Poco F7 Ultra well naturally is that same Supreme Snapdragon Italy you'll find stuffed inside of the other Ultra phones from Samsung and xiaomi as one of the most most powerful chipsets around right now packs more pork than a chip and Deal's thong uh it's accompanied here in my review model with 16 gigs of RAM rather generous although the PCO F7 Ultra is also available in a not quite so capable 12 gig Flavor now zipping around through the UI isn't always super smooth you will see the occasional wi jutter here and there which I believe is down to the hypos itself rather than the actual chipset which is frankly stunning it's still a lot smoother than iOS on that iPhone 16e thanks to that 60 HZ display but and just be aware you will see the occasional Wii Jer which does detract somewhat from the ultra Vibes but of course the Poco F7 Ultra more than capable when it comes to a bit of gaming action and what better way to test it than a tasty slice of we and waves with all the visual settings maxed right out naturally and I found that with the Hy prosos gaming mods wild boost featur switched on the PCO F7 Ultra maintains a consistent frame rate hovering around 58 to 60 frames per second even after well over an hour of gaming every time I had my ass handed to me by some massive gribbly thing it was 100% down to me and not the smartphone and you got a bit of that liquid cool 4.0 Tex slapped in here as well bit of vapor chamber action all the usual Shenanigans I did find the Poco F7 Ultra barely even gets warm let alone hot again even if you're gaming for the duration you got plenty more gaming tools slapped on here as well to help prevent distractions from ruining your gaming session all that kind of stuff and so far so highly arousing but put away the baby oil cuz we're not quite done yet now if you're a proper full-on Tech Spud you might have noticed by now that most of these specs here on the Poco F7 Ultra match xiaomi's redmi k80 Pro which never actually made made it over here to the UK I believe it's China or might have made it to a couple of other countries like Singapore potentially that is because of course a lot of pocko phones are simply rebranded redmy unfortunately however one bit of specs action that didn't make the cut was the Battery tech because while the redmi k80 pro rocked a 6,000 milliamp capacity battery that's been Whitted down to just 5,300 milliamp here in the pock the reason for this is most likely the same thing that happened to the honor magic 7 Pro basically you can probably actually blame those stuffy Euro bureaucrats and their damn pesky health and safety regulations the same bunch of Lefty squares who say yeah you probably shouldn't stick a Bluetooth speaker up your rectum and then blast a good bit of Leonard Cohen for those rumbly Bassy good times I tell you it's health and safety Gone Bananas and don't even get me started on the bananas and thankfully do not worry the Poco F7 Ultra still lasts slightly longer than my erection during The Last of the Summer Wine Marathon most years I ended up slumping into bed with around 30% battery life remaining on the Poco F7 Ultra and that's was some pretty heavy mixed use lots of video streaming go a camera action plenty of audio streaming in the background as well andth though not quite as special when it came to gaming I found I got roughly 4 hours of full-on weather and waves action on the go with that hyper wild boost mode acting it's kind of similar to what I got from the other Ultras in this department although some Rivals saw for instance the Oppo Renault 13 Pro do manage to stretch out that game and experience to closer to 5 hours on a full charge but back to the good news cuz the Poco F7 Ultra Bost a bit of 120 watt wired fast charging as long as you use a big old beefy adapter of course and that certainly is bloody Ultra effortlessly beaten the Samsung Galaxy s25 Ultra and even the xiaomi 15 Ultra and additionally you've also got 50 W wireless charging support So cracking stuff so hey kitties let's finish up this Poco F7 Ultra review with a bit of a squint at the camera Tech which sadly doesn't sound quite as Ultra as some other smartphones which happen to have Ultra in their name what you've got here is a triple lens setup with a 50 megapixel main shooter using the same light Fusion 800 sensor that was previously stuffed in the Poco F6 Pro you've also got yourself a 50 meg floting telephoto lens with 2.5 times optical zoom it's a 60 mil equivalent and finally a 32m ultrawide shooter and you will notice of course there's no Leica shenanigan slapped on here unlike the xiaomi 15 Ultra so while PCO is quite proud of the image processing smarts here on the PCO F7 Ultra you don't get any of that fine tuning that Leica provided for the xiaomi alternative but it is still essentially the same likable xiaomi camera app complete with those easy to drag down toggles likes the motion track and focus you do have the a shananigans but I typically leave these turned off as they are off by default anyway and you'll certainly notice that the shutter speed is supremely fast as is the image processing no hanging about now high contrast scenarios are handled quite well by the Poco F7 Ultra with only the occasional saturation in those daylight snaps colors usually aren't whitewashed while darker areas aren't often artificially brightened although I did regrettably see some lens flaring when the sun was actually shining the Poco F7 Ultra can also capture quite crispy detail even in softer light you won't see too much grein intruding in your pics making them look all fuzzy and CAC portrait shots also usually come out well those edges aren't overly smoothed out skin tones seem to look natural although the ultra did occasionally struggle to focus on some of my non-human subjects especially when using the zoom now speaking of which that Zoom certainly isn't a match for other flagships even if it is quite handy for getting a bit closer to the action although zooming beyond the five times level quickly results in diminishing returns and the ultra wide shooter is simply fine with a sometimes quite clear drop in detail levels and color accuracy you got all the usual bonus bits as well including a good bit of PR mode action it's again packed with all the usual tools that you found on that xiaomi 15 Ultra including the focus peaking although there's no way as far as I can tell at least of shooting in raw here unlike the xiaomi 15 Ultra and for your whole movie type Shenanigans where you can capture up to 4K resolution footage at 60 frames per second there's no 4K 120 FPS option or anything supremely Ultra like that you can also boost up to 8K if you want at 24 frames per second and xiaomi's director mode is back in Action as well if you want full manual controls over your video yes this does offer the option of shooting in log if you want to now same as the photo mode I saw some lens flaring when shooting video and that sun was actually beaming through the thick layer of cloud but hey the stabilization is good enough for moving and shooting at the same time zoom in and you will sometimes notice a clear dip in visual quality with that secondary sensor colors are Zapped and the visuals can look a lot more fuzzy but audio capture is beautifully clear in all directions and the ultra doesn't seem too phased by a bit of wind and you can shoot up to 1080p full HD video here on the Poco F7 Ultra using that front-facing 32 megap selfie camera no 4K option which is a bit of a surprise especially from an ultra branded smartphone that's the minimum I'd expect but at least the full HD footage looks reasonably sharp the audio pickups fire stability is good and everything so no real issues and there you have it you lovely lot that is what this semi South Northern Mongrel reckons of the Poco F7 Ultra lots to love here of course the excellent absolutely banging performance perfect for gamers and the like the battery life is proper good with some supremely fast charging action camera Tech proper decent loved watching movies and shows and stuff on here fantastic bit of audio Etc but is it actually an ultra smartphone well there are some def efficiencies as well the designs not particularly trouser rousin just a few Wei things like the emission of eim support as well it's the kind of stuff that I would expect on a pro smartphone let alone an ultra but that said the PO F7 Ultra is 650 quid which is half the fraking price of the likes of the Samsung Galaxy s25 Ultra and the xiaomi 15 Ultra and is it worth 650s I would say absolutely yes if you're after a flank ship style experi experience being on spunk out a bloody Grand on it it's a strong rival to the likes of oppo's Reno 13 Pro which uh my full review of that will be going live next week there certainly a step up from the likes of Samsung's Galaxy a56 and bloody hell the iPhone 16e don't even consider that heap of junk when you put that side by side with this it's absolutely criminal that that thing is just 50 less and that's if you're happy to put up with 128 gigs of storage if you want 256 like this one you're actually paying more for that iPhone 16e than a bloody Ultra anyway that's enough rambly

And now, 4 months later, it arrives on PlayStation 5 consoles, too. To cut to the chase, this translation to PS5 and PS5 Pro is a success all round. It compares well to Series X in particular with developer machine games, realizing an authentic take on the Indiana Jones films using its motor engine, a customized branch of IDTech 7, which itself powered the likes of 2020s Doom Eternal. It's impressive stuff. From the near onetoone recreation of Raiders of the Lost Dark's opening scene to the sprawling Vatican City, each level plays host to all manner of whip cracking, stealth, puzzling, and sleuththing. And once again, we get ray traced global illumination RTGI into the bargain on PS5 consoles, allowing for more accurate indirect lighting and shading. All of this impressively runs at 60 frames pers, too. So, how does the PS5 experience match up to Series X, and what's the state of performance in comparison? Let's find out. A few points to start. The Great Circle on PS5 has parity feature-wise with the Series X release, though, it's worth noting that it adds adaptive trigger support on its Dual Sense controller for pulling the trigger on guns and also melee. Beyond that, the visual setup is remarkably straightforward. Machine Games optimizes PS5 purely around a 60fps experience with RTGi as the de facto means of lighting its environments. There is no graphics mode toggle nor any alternative 30 fps option pushing higher fidelity settings. But the upshot is that we do get a broadly polished single means of playing the game. to the comparisons and I've captured PS5 and PS5 Pro on the game's latest update 1.03 as of recording and fresh capture of Series X's most current build. It's also worth noting that I'm using the standard 16-9 aspect ratio view on all systems. So, in a three-way split, there are a mixture of fortunes here. But the positive first in terms of most core visual settings, all three platforms are exactly matched. texture quality, shadow resolution, and world detail draw across the forest all run at the same settings between PS5, PS5 Pro, and Series X. Likewise, the quality of the RTGi, which on Series X runs at lower than PC's low settings, also translates to both PS5 machines. In effect, this setting limits the objects within the scene affected by the ray traced diffused lighting pass. It's a trade-off to hit that 60 fps target on console while also keeping RTGI in place, but the result is still impressive overall. Otherwise, Volutric lighting quality is also matched between base PS5 and Series X, though it appears we get a higher setting on PS5 Pro here. The net benefit being that there's marginally less aliasing along the streaks of light spilling through the college windows, though it does fall short of PC's best volutric setting. In every other respect, there is parity between the three. Sadly, this also extends to the game's occasional rough points on Series X, notably the presentation of Shadows. Even all these months on from release, there's a lingering issue with shadow filtering on Xbox, which stays in place on the PS5 consoles as well. In short, shadow maps across the floors and walls will abruptly step up in detail based on your proximity to it. And this update occurs in set meterlength increments to make matters more obvious. It's a shame that shadow filtering is such a distraction and it's really the only blemish on what's otherwise a wellresented package visually. There is also a small discrepancy in brightness on Series X worth touching on owing to its default setting being five clicks higher than PS5 by default, but really that's the full extent of the difference there. Speaking on resolutions, Machine Games keeps it simple on base PS5, but enhances the Pro version to allow a higher max pixel output. Dynamic resolution scaling is in play with PS5 and Series X, each running at a 1200p to,800p range, while PS5 Pro adjusts between a higher 1440p lower bounds rising to 4K at peak. all use IDTEx TAA method to clean up visual noise with the only side effect being the presence of occasional banding on movement across busy points within the frame like fine stitching on clothing. It's also worth stressing that these DRS ranges don't tell the whole story in terms of image quality as raw metrics. They only point to the extreme best and worst cases, but the average practical resolution tends to rest in between those values. For example, focusing on PS5 and Series X, which share the same 1200 to,800p range, it's clear that Series X often runs at a higher resolution on average. In almost every scenario, Series X renders more pixels per frame, resulting in a sharper resolve, especially visible while zooming into the dense jungle detail of the first level. [Music] This Series X image quality advantage is curious, but consistent with another IT Tech7 game, Doom Eternal. In both cases, we have a use of hardwarebased variable rate shading, VRS, which was engineered by Microsoft's advanced technology group. Also, much like Doom Eternal, the Great Circle shares the same 1,800p targets resolution where VRS reduces the bandwidth taken up by pixel shading threads. It's a huge benefit for taxing ray traced games in this mold and ultimately frees up Series X's GPU to push to higher resolutions along its DRS scale. This would go a long way to explain the sharper image next to PS5 where hardware VRS is not supported. And despite their matching DRS ranges, just as with Doom Eternal, though, compared to PS5, there are subtle downsides to using this feature, notably a more obvious form of block noise. Neither console is totally free of visual noise, even with film grain and chromatic aberration disabled. But these block noise artifacts are more apparent on Series X. One example of this in action that I found is this zoomin on Indiana's suit. At a regular viewing distance, it's not a massive distraction. And these issues are ultimately outweighed by the way VRS affords Series X a boost in overall [Music] clarity. The PS5 Pro enhancement is worth touching on too. While hardwarebased VRS is in theory a feature on PS5 Pro, it appears the rendering setup in the Great Circle is no different to the base console. Even so, PS5 Pro excels for its ability to generate higher resolution frames afforded by a beefier 16.7 teraflop GPU. Going up to a native 4K at best means the fine thread work of clothing appears pin sharp, especially compared to base PS5, as does the presentation of grass in the opening jungle. PS5 Pro pushes the cleanest image of the trio here, even if benefits in settings outside of this are rather limited. Jumping to performance testing next. The Great Circle benefits from strong optimization on PS5 and PS5 Pro alike for any regular gameplay. Each one is tightly optimized around a 60fps target where areas flooded with NPCs or the dense jungles simply fly by at 60. For any variances in on-screen load, their dynamic resolution setups are able to compensate. Though it's not always a perfectly smooth ride. Much like Series X, there are two minor nuisances that carry over to PS5 systems. Firstly, there is an autosaving feature which will trigger a small hitch, a frame time spike that kicks in at invisible thresholds around the world. It's especially obvious while navigating the Vatican City with each mini stutter being followed by a small autosave symbol. And all round, it's a shame that it's not more discreet. The second point relates to the in engine cutscenes. As authentic as each cinematic is, every camera cut is coupled with a string of dropped frames. Most likely, this is a buffer of sorts used by the renderer to allow the physics-based elements on screen, like clothing, to settle for a few frames first and therefore avoid a distracting position refresh with every cut. Likewise, it might be there to help disguise the game's DRS switches. Still, the end result is PS5, PS5 Pro, and Series X all drop frames at these exact same moments. And as you can see, there's nothing to split [Music] them. With all that being said, there is one repeatable drop during an in-g engine scene later in the Crypts of the Vatican. This is a rare outlier case really given that everything else runs so well, but it does underline a Series X advantage. As Indiana studies this parchment, a vehicle comes crashing through the ceiling causing a burst of alpha and particle effects to fill the frame. In this moment, Series X has the GPU headroom to get closest to 60 frames pers with the expected hitches on every camera cut. PS5 by comparison takes a more drastic hit down to the 40s. Again, this is a rare moment, but I figured it worth highlighting to show another potential advantage of Series X's hardware VRS. Indiana Jones and The Great Circle makes a successful leap onto PS5 platforms, and despite its delayed release, everything we loved about the Xbox experience is intact. In comparison, the Series X is a preference over the base PS5 given the often higher average resolution on Xbox, but the margin isn't wide enough to be a dealbreaker. PS5 owners still get a superb take on Machine Games latest work here. In every other respect, the two are matched right down to the consistency of their 60 fps readings in gameplay and of course the use of RTGI. PS5 Pro, meanwhile, enjoys an extra benefit in image clarity over the other consoles with a higher 4K maximum target while still hitting 60 fps. The only criticism here is one I'd level at all three consoles that the shadow filtering remains a rough spot that only the PC version is currently able to fix. Beyond that, it's a well recommended release on PS5 if you're sticking with console. But that's all from me today.

been actually testing this Smartphone for the last 2 and a half weeks or so and uh I also have the nothing phone 3A Pro but I would not recommend this one I'll talk about that later uh but and this video can be a little bit long uh because I'm going to go in depth regarding uh this Smartphone so that people who are interested in buying decision can go over it I made a lot of notes over this one so we will go uh after each and every aspect that is actually important but first uh let me actually uh give you the summary uh first itself for those people who are impatient let me talk about the summary what do I feel about the nothing phone 3A nothing phone 3A is an excellent midrange Android phone with decent performance and no adwar or blo Weare apps wish pixel a series was like this I would say because this does not have any heating issues and even the battery life is actually very very good and it offers that clean Android sort of experience with a nothing OS flavor uh the phone performs well in regular usage there was no Heating and gets actually very good battery life and the camera is also pretty decent I would say uh I have no problems recommending this phone to my friends and family members who don't want to spend more than 25,000 000 rupees on a smartphone but want a balanced smartphone without any uh what say blo wear and a clean OS experience but for hardcore Gamers I would uh uh say look at Poco series or even the IU series as you can get uh slightly better processors that might be better for gaming uh on the other hand I find the uh nothing phone 3A Pro not to be that value because the price gap between these two smartphones is about 5,000 and only difference is the slight Improvement in the rear facing camera apart from that and yes the front facing camera on this one can record in 4K video whereas you can't do that on this one so yeah you heard that ringtone about it sorry about it so the the ringtones is loud uh so I would definitely say if the if it's the value proposition definitely the nothing phone 3A is more value yes the price Gap is about 5,000 between these two smartphones uh but for Pure value this is better and as we are talking about value and all those things uh let me also talk about the pricing uh you can get this one uh it starts at 25,000 but as of now you're getting 2,000 Rupees what do you say credit card bank discount or whatever so it work starts at about 23,000 so first uh before I dwell into this one let me actually compare it with the nothing phone 2 way uh that is the successor to this one and the biggest difference I would say is that this one actually had that plastic back hence it was a fingerprint magnet I would say and yes if you notice closely there are some Nicks Etc on this one because it's plastic here now they have gone with the glass design so definitely when you pick it up for the first time this feels a lot more premium uh but again this is Panda glass they are using they should have gone with gorilla glass both for the front and uh what do you say back it's the same and also uh the phone if you look at it is a little bit on the larger side uh definitely and I think so uh that's a wrong area because this is definitely a pretty big and a wide phone uh having a 6.67 in screen so it's definitely more wider this was slightly more comfortable to hold in hand so uh if you uh this is definitely a big phone uh so again for uh if you have small hands it's a two-handed device so that is something I I have noticed I like the what do you say size of this one I don't know why they had to make it this big but uh one thing that I immediately noticed yes both of them are having an amulet screen and again on even on this one it's a 120 HZ uh screen and again if you notice it's very very fluid but one thing I noticed is that I'll open the same web page Economic Times and uh let me just refresh it let me also refresh this one okay so same page and if you notice closely uh let me just lower the brightness also slightly on this one uh the colors the panel used on this this one is slightly better if you notice the whites are a lot more whiter on this one compared to the nothing phone 2A uh so that is again I have noticed and uh this is also making a difference in direct sunlight outdoors I would say this was a lot more legible in direct sunlight so they have actually put a nice amulet panel on uh this one and again it's at 120 HZ I did not have any issues with this one and the big deal is that many of these phones in this price range when you use it in direct sunlight the screen is hard visible but here it's actually pretty uh decent I would say so overall uh it's actually a nice experience that you're getting and again the glass because of the glass back even when you hold it it feels a little bit more premium I would say so this is how it looks from the back so definitely I would say feels like a upgrade in the build quality definitely if you're coming from this one but again I like the uh size of this one this is slightly Compact and ideal I would say this is slightly on those bigger size smartphone uh now coming to the outer chases uh this is actually made up of polycarbonate with a fiber mix uh 20% fiber uh so it's not metallic but again does not feel very flimsy I would say but the internal frame that we have on this Smartphone the inside frame is made up of aluminium so that's what it is but outer shell still uh it's that polycarbonate plastic kind of a thing that was used even on uh this one so uh one New Edition that we have on this one is this essential uh key let me quickly talk about it right now I would say uh you can use this one as a if you just press it once it takes a screenshot and now you can add a note to this one a voice note or let's say What's it Trump whatever sanctions on sanctions or whatever so later on I can come to this and it goes in a uh shelf and you to access that essential shelf you just double tap and if you open this uh space all your stuff whatever you have done like that actually gets stored into this you can also uh record voice notes and this is supposed to be AI enabled but as of now it's I would say this is evolving not all the features are there so I would say this button as of now is a hyper version of the pixel screenshot uh that we had so that's what it is great to take screenshot u in future it says if you have notes and Etc it can extract that text and get intelligence but as of now it's not enabled and they say that there will be enabled or coming in the future so that is what is regarding this button uh bottom again speakers this also has stereo speakers and I'm happy to see again you don't have a vent over here and the front speaker sound comes from here but it's actually pretty loud and edicate so I did not have any problems regarding the speakers on this one and one thing to noce that in India uh the maximum RAM that you can get uh with the 3A variant is 8 GB of RAM but in European countries you also have a 12 GB Ram variant but for some reason they did not launch the uh 12 GB Ram variant of uh this Smartphone uh the in display fingerprint scanner is actually good on this one let me just uh remove this uh some notification and so this is actually good so I didn't have a problem it's slightly on the lower side it should have been here but again it works actually very well so that way I would say once I also actually took me about a day or two to get used to the size because the width is slightly on the larger side this feels like using the iPhone Max series phone uh that is what it is regarding the width I would say the thing that stands out among this Smartphone compared to many of the Android phones in this price range is the nothing OS on this one and this is I would say a very clean uh uh Android experience uh I didn't we did not have any what is say extra bloatware or crappy apps generally that we find on most of the Android smartphone in this range for example let's say you take Vivo phone Oppo phones and xiaomi phones they have a bunch of extra stuff and apps that was not the case and if you go towards the left again it's a very clean stock kind of Android experience but you'll notice one thing is that the icons on this one are all grade out and when you are setting up the phone you have an option of that for example uh on this one I didn't do it completely on the older phone and as you can see some of the icons are in color so you can obviously have it in color like this uh but there was an option of this one so I opted for this one so gives a ni a nice look I would say even on this uh Pro as you can see I did not enable all the icons for the gray scale so yeah some of them are in color so you have that option but here I enabled that gray scale option uh so that's what it is and gives a very different kind of a Vibe I would say one thing I like about this OS is that they have added a and worked a lot on the widgets for example the weather widget is a lot better I would say um and uh again we also have this widget this shows the screen on time that you're doing and even you have a lot of customization on the lock screen for example on the lock screen I've have set it to the pedometer so how much I'm walking Etc it gives an idea the weather and all those things so this is also a little bit more customizable I would say so in terms of what do you say customization and blo fe uh experience I would say they have actually done a very good uh job I would say this comes very close to the pixel sort of experience that you can get and even the Motorola Motorola also has started adding some extra apps now in their smartphones in this range but here I'm happy to see that they are not doing it and again this is also very very clean and you have a lot of toggles over here you can remove it and stuff I have kept it actually very very clean uh so that's what it is so if you are a person who does not like that extra bloatware uh adwar apps and extra stuff hogging your smartphone you will like this experience I'm happy to see that uh they haven't added a lot of junk Fair on this one and in terms of General performance also if you notice uh the phone is actually pretty fast uh I'm using the 120 HZ let me just show you if I go towards the setting and uh again this is the layout that you're getting in display as you can see you have uh uh High I have kept it on high referes rate and throughout my testing for the last two weeks I have kept it to actually 12 HZ but by default when you get it it will be on Dynamic maybe if you keep on Dynamic maybe you can eek out about 1 or 2 hours extra battery life but I did all my testing on the highest setting and I did not have any issues so I would say it's a very very fluid experience in fact actually much more fluid than what I expected yes I notice some minor stutters at time I would say just about 2 3% uh of the time and that was happening only when I was extensively using the camera and coming back to the device then only I noticed a little bit of stutter but for the rest of the usage uh I would say it's a very very fluid and smooth experience so I feel I always say that uh Android many of the youngsters just get excited about the hardware specs hardware specs with software optimization is super super important and I think so the nothing team has done a good job in that software optimization part uh coming to the Android upgrades on this one if I go to about the phone as you can see this is nothing phone 3A and this is the nothing phone 3 3.1 which is nothing but which is nothing but yeah Android 15 and they are promising next 3 years of Android upgrades and 6 years of what do you say security updates so that is what it is and again you can have a look at this one these are the specs of this Smartphone again as I've told you in India the maximum RAM that you can get is 8 GB and the storage is 256 GB also the base variant will come with 128 GB of storage uh one thing to notice that and here I'm a little bit unhappy uh they're using ufs 2.2 storage and for the most part as I've told you the phot is not laggy it's very very smooth but as this is just having 8 GB of RAM I am actually using the RAM Booster on it this one for that additional 4 GB of RAM and I think so when I was coming out from the camera that minor lag Etc that I was seeing maybe because of the ufs 2.2 storage and I was using that RAM Booster so that's the only nitpicking that I have regarding uh that and I don't know why they didn't launch the 12 GB Ram variant in India uh now coming to another uh thing is regarding the cellular call Quality on this smartphone as I've told you I've used this for over 2 weeks and in fact uh four actually 4 days I was completely out of Hyderabad strangling to Bangalore around Bangalore I actually drove in the car so for the four 4 and a half days I was completely on only on mobile data and uh I have to say the cellular call Quality on this one is excellent uh if you even a business person you take long calls sometimes in meetings and stuff you have to take long cellular calls for 15 20 minutes no issues with the smartphone no proximity sensor issue or whatsoever so in terms of cellular call Quality and the year piece you actually getting a very good one and also if you take calls for example when I was in the car some uh I took some calls why the speaker phone and the speaker phone is also adequately loud on this one so that way I would say they have done a good job and yes of course it does support Wi-Fi 6 as you can see I have a Wi-Fi 6 router and it is connected to the Wi-Fi 6 router uh even in terms of Wi-Fi I did not have any issues Wi-Fi calling is also there and that works so in terms of the basic calls and the uh networking that you have Wi-Fi and all these things I did not have any issues with this smartphone now coming to htic uh I was surprised to see that the htic for a smartphone priced around this price point that 24 25,000 has been done well yes please don't compare it with flagships that cost 70,000 80,000 but the htics on this one are done actually well let's also talk about the uh General usage and uh with the Snapdragon 7 s gen 3 that's is having the Snapdragon 7s gen 3 again guys this is the clock down version of the regular Snapdragon 7 gen 3 I would say and in day-to-day operations as I've told you I don't have any problems with this one let me auto brightness is going crazy okay let me brighten it down so in day-to-day performance again as I've told you no lag or whatever and again uh one more thing is that even the regular usage I would say day-to-day usage I did not have any heating issues on this uh smartphone so some people get worried about Heating and stuff uh this Smartphone hardly gets warm uh because it's the 7 7s uh Gen 3 is not a super powerful uh processor uh next thing is uh in the battery and because of that processor and this is having that 5,000 mAh battery the battery life that I was getting is also actually very good let me actually show you the stats I didn't charge it from yesterday and again guys all my battery starts are with single Sim uh that is my primary Sim I'm using the my a Sim on this one and generally all my testing all all my reviews I generally do with a single Sim so again all these St is based on a single Sim us it let me actually show you the battery stats if I go to the battery as you can see still we have about 55% battery left and let's see I had charged it Tuesday morning I had take took took it out and today it's wednessday almost it'll be 11: so I've already got a screen on time of 5 hours 29 minutes and we have still have about 55% battery life left let me actually show you some actually screenshots that I've took about the battery when I was traveling and stuff uh where is it do it screenshots yeah let's go to the screenshots and as you can see this was what at uh it was 11% battery life left and uh almost 2 and 1 half days uh between the charges screen on time of 8 hours 15 minutes that I got and this is mixed usage guys I would say it was like 40% time on mobile data and 60% on and this one 8 hours 22 minutes uh we still had about 12% battery life again notice the uh charge I didn't have to charge it every day it charged it only after about 2 and a half days of usage and um this again this huh this battery start was one I was only on mobile data and again here also as you can see I got very good battery life so I you could say you can expect a screen on time of anywhere between 7 hours to 9 hours easily with the smartphone and U for normal casual users you can charge it once in 2 days uh but Even If you're sort of a heavy user and if you charge uh your smartphone typically at night you can get about 9 10 hours of s so with this uh smartphone so in terms of battery life it actually performed very very well this one now has a triple camera this is an upgrade I would say from the nothing phone 2A which actually just had a two camera setup this is having a three camera setup the main camera is a 50 megix which has Ys uh now we also have a 2X Zoom which is also again 50 megapix and we have a Ultra wide which is a Sony sensor of 8 megapixel and I would say the camera performance is decent as you can see with this shots but again I've already posted a dedicated video regarding the camera performance it's 889 minute video which goes in depth about this one again check out that for more info okay uh so that's what about the good things about this device now let's talk about some of the things I did not like with this device the cons I would say one thing I noticed is that I don't know if it's the reviewes or whatever the volume button has a wobble and I thought okay this is the 3A fine the power button slightly less I would say but even this essential button the volume button have a slight wobble towards it and so I got a little bit curious okay well let's test it on this 3A Pro and surprisingly on the 3A Pro it's even more play that I have so I don't know if this is just the these are review units this early batch but this is something I do not like I would say uh because yes they claim to be ip64 but if the buttons are slightly loose and Bobble and this phone falls into the water the water can leak actually to the motherboard so that is something I did not like because I have two units and both are exhibiting the same uh next thing is regarding the RAM management I've already told you uh because of that 8 GB of ram I've noticed that the RAM management is slightly on the aggressive side of the smartphone uh don't get me wrong it's not like it boots out every app that you're using but for example let's say uh you were using YouTube and you did other work etc let's say you went to X did some browsing stuff and came after a couple of hours and opened YouTube as you can see it reloaded my YouTube so it does not keep that in memory uh so there is a tendency of like actually booting out some of the apps from Ram so I think so that is because the RAM management is on the aggressive side of this Smartphone but don't get me wrong I did not have any issues with the critical apps for example True caller which has to be in memory never had an issue I always got the notification I also have this my gate app for security of our society I always get the notifications WhatsApp also again I did not miss any notification or with SMS app Etc but again yes uh if you are using some apps and coming uh after sometime it has a tendency to reload the heavy apps and the RAM management is definitely on the aggressive site uh as I've told you the storage is ufs 2.2 not a big deal breaker but again I would say uh at least for the pro they should have gone with the ufs 3.1 the pro is just a pro moniker I would say simply does not make sense because the pro is also having exactly the same Hardware same processor same what do you say uh RAM and even uh the same uh what do you say storage type it's just the rare camera from the 2x Zoom is becoming the 3x zoom and again the front facing camera this one has a 32 map and this one is having a 15 map so that's why I say this the pro moniker on this one does not make that much sense and also in terms of inh hand feel uh the regular 3A feels a lot more balanced device the pro because of this camera ring is 10 G heavier and it's actually top heavy I will have to say uh next thing I do not like is that yes you get just this box and if you notice the box box is pretty slim not much you just get a cable and a s tool no charger in the box and here I'm a little bit annoyed because they say that they have increased the charging speed to 50 wats I have a couple of PD Chargers older PD Chargers U PD charger that is 65 W PD charger and also 100 W PD charger and I generally charge many of the smartphones uh with that one in fact if I recall the Samsung Galaxy s25 Ultra also doesn't come with the charger and I charged that smartphone with that PD charger and yes it was charging at 40 wats but this Smartphone for some reason in fact as I've told you two PD Chargers was simply not charging at very high speeds it was charging just at about 20 21 wat so yes they claim that 50 wat charging or whatever but again I feel if you want to take advantage of that 50 W charging or something like that then you might have to end up buying a a specific nothing charger and that will cost you extra I don't know about 1,000 bucks or something so that is also something you have to take into account there is no charger bundle in the box so yes they are advertising that 50 W charging but again if you're using a generic PD charger don't expect to get those 50 W uh charging rates yes I like that they moved from the plastic which feels very very grimy and again as you fingerprint magnet to Glass feels a lot more more uh premium to hold and avoids those fingerprints but again this is Panda glass I feel I don't know it's I have dropped it once on hard floor when I was traveling as I've told you again it didn't shatter or didn't get any Nicks uh so that's good but I don't know um I feel most people they should have gone with the variant of Gorilla Glass in my Frank Opinion also some of you will ask there is actually a screen protector actually pre-applied on this Smartphone I haven't actually removed it so there is a screen protector that was uh pre-applied to the smartphone another thing as you have seen in the and if you not again watch my camera review of this one that's a dedicated video uh for some reason though this is a 32 mapix front-facing camera they have disabled 4K video recording just to sell the pro version the pro version has 4K video recording from the front- facing camera yes the rear facing camera does 4K uh video recording with the main lens and lastly yes we also have this glyph lighting these three glyph lightings on this one and to be very Frank I am I'm not sold regarding the gliph lighting the only place where I use the glyph lighting is and you do the split to keep it just lights up to show me that it has gone in the Do Not Disturb more but apart from that the glip nighting personally for me is not a big selling point so this was the nothing phone 3A with its pros and cons and I would still say that if you are on a tight budget uh below 25,000 or something like that and overall if you want a good balanced smartphone without that uh ad wear or a bloat wear experience and it's a fast and fluid phone you can certainly go with this one but again if you're sort of a hardcore gamer then I would not go with this one so guys this was my review of the nothing phone 3A do let me know what do you feel about the same and guys if you're still not subscribed to the YouTube channel hit that subscribe button and also if you

p0KZ3agcuNheF7aHD-9SGDkI6lc,Do NOT buy the HP Envy x360 - Rant Time,We review the new HP Envy x360 (2024 Model) and find that it has all of the same issues as the previous generations. That is to ...,Chris G,2024-09-11T17:54:40Z,"{'default': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mfj83kzfNZ4/default.jpg', 'width': 120, 'height': 90}, 'medium': {'url':

360}}",,mfj83kzfNZ4,411,129439,en,mfj83kzfNZ4,here we have the latest Envy X360 from hulet Packer and because it's an HP I don't want it to get I don't want to give it the Dignity of a full blown review because at the end of the day even if you got this for free if your friend or colleague gave it to you as like uh here just have this it's tantamount to a slap in the face this thing is a piece of now like every HP product they can't invent their own look design or function so they try to rip somebody off comes in que of app's MacBook Pro pretty much a straight ripoff all the way down to the black keyboard now it's nice that HP is listening to me and putting black key caps on their keyboards finally But ultimately you can look at this thing and then look at a MacBook Pro right next to it and say huh which one is the good one I wanted to do a quick injection in the video before we proceed to the rest of my complaining because ultimately that's I think what I did in this video was just complain about the computer and I didn't offer more anecdotal evidence as to why you shouldn't buy it so what I'd like what the point I'd like to make about this video and why you shouldn't buy the hpmv X360 bottom line is is we get more X360 is in here for issues than any other U model or or brand of computer so on top of hp's already really really bad reputation for reliability you then have a model that you then can't repair because finding parts are either outrageously expensive or hard to find or if not impossible to find um warranty in warranty support with HP is atrocious and out of warranty support is non-existent so what you're doing is you're investing in what is supposed to be a very high-end premium computer and you're not really gaining anything from it for example you can get spec for spec better options from Dell or Lenovo uh build quality will be superior on both of those even I mean Asus Acer I mean really pretty much any of the brands and then the bottom line is just simply that when you take a look at hul Packer's reputation across the board with its products and you compare it to the design theories that either a it stole from other people or B that it's trying to make itself you just find that dollar for dooll it is just a better choice to go with other manufacturers you know again they made this computer look exactly like a MacBook Pro well then just go with a MacBook Pro it's Superior or if you want the windows equivalent then you know get the Inspiron 16 Pro or plus um Lenovo yo you get the idea so uh anyway um point is is that we see a lot of of these X 360s come in with very severe problems broken motherboards screen failures Etc HP hasn't solved any of those issues so even though on paper this computer looks good I really urge you not to buy it it's just not a good Financial Choice speakers even on it poly Studio they're like a three and a half out of five maybe four out of five something like that ultimately also pretty disappointing when you sort of take a step back from this thing and you and you take all the specs on paper such as the high resolution screen the touch screen fact that it's a two in one you can fold it turn it into a little touchscreen notebook big touch pad which is a very small touchpads are a complaint of mine on this channel but nevertheless it has a big touchpad so you think I would love it backl on the keyboard Windows hello compatible camera you start to think to yourself wow this thing offers a lot of bang your buck until you remember that it's a huet packer and that it will last you all of maybe 10 days here's the thing it's made out of aluminum it's lightweight and it seems like it can take a beating but it absolutely cannot we already had a one one issue with it when we were uh doing a data transfer and it ended up having a problem that we had to get in the Bios mess with basically stop the booting why can't I get rid of that bar there at the bottom I keep moving the mouse maybe if I didn't touch it it would go away anyway um so we already had one issue software wise with it next is that hulet Packard still hasn't solved the problem of the non-reparable screen and guess what you cannot find these X360 screens after market so that means the second this thing goes out of warranty you're  out of luck no upgradeability on it can't replace or upgrade the RAM you can upgrade the nvme solid state drive that's pretty nice but that's it basically this thing and they did take a design queue from Apple on that too basically once you've build this thing out that is what it is so no repairability no upgradeability the specs are okay but it's not mind-blowing for the money that you spend so ultimately what you're going to get is something unreliable something that will have problems and break basically guaranteed a day after the warranty ends and ultimately I'm not impressed with the speed you know I tried using this for our benchmarks and doing our everyday you know our our practicality tests on it as the Intel core Ultra 7 that should mean that it's like Ultra quick but it isn't you get the little spinning blue Windows 11 Circle fairly often because of course youa Packer loads in a bunch of nonsense on it that you don't need um who would want this computer I don't know nobody buy a Dell or a Lenovo or an Asus or pretty much any other brand instead io on it uh multiuse Jack for audio USB type a port on that side two Thunderbolt ports USBC full size HDMI and then another Super Speed type a port guess that's one nice thing doesn't have a proprietary charging Jack on it because it does run on Fuller energy so you are going to need to charge this thing on USBC which it does come with so that's a nice touch I'll I'll grant them that uh I like giving you know props where props are due um but ultimately should you buy this computer hell no uh again I really can't stress this enough just go ahead and get any other possible brand um every single HP that we have reviewed in like the actually almost ever except I think with one laptop uh every HP we have ever tested has undergone some kind of issue in our testing phases um their quality control is Despicable and their customer service is even worse we have two videos posted on why you should avoid holip Packer products check those out for other user experiences it's really quite a shame anyway that was our that's really the only information you need to know about the HP Envy X360 laptop should you buy it no um so if you have any questions on it feel free to reach out to us in the comment section feel free to buy something else and if you have any just subscribe and we'll be back with another video really soon,1,"The video transcript is a critical review of the HP Envy x360

Just 250 quid buys you a massive blower with a poppy AMOLED display, a big old battery, and a selfie cam that's ideal for those sexy club snaps. Plus, a camera button that's somehow less pants than the iPhone 16 Pros, despite the fact that Apple's brick costs four times as much. Uh, factor in the obligatory AI shenanigans, which again somehow is less rubbish on this budget Android blower than on Apple's overpriced CAC, and suddenly you begin to realize it's actually a better idea to snuffle a cheapy Android than to spunk out a grand for an iPhone 16 Pro. After all, you'll be saving yourself 750 quid, which is almost half a year's worth of Greg's meal deals. Anyway, I had my SIM slipped inside the Honor 400 Light these past few days. So, let's check it out. And for more on the latest and greatest tech, please do poke subscribe and ding that notifications bell. Cheers. So, first up, scrutinizing the design of the Honor 400 Lite. I don't think many people would have guessed that it's a 250 pond handset. It's quite clear that Honor has taken inspiration from the iPhone here. It's not as much of a wide bobb. You got nice skinny bezels up front, perfectly flat display as well, and of course, bit of a chungster of a selfie cam orifice. And then of course you've got the very much in fashion completely flat edging which I'm not a massive fan of but thankfully the Honor 400 Lite pretty comfortable to clutch. Certainly helped by the fact that it's a very slender handset and of course you got those rounded corners to improve the hand feel. And Honor has gone for a basic plastic frame. Unsurprising given the price point, though it does betray this phone's budget root, but it does at least have a metallic style matte finish. Certainly looks decent. Doesn't get grubby. doesn't pick up fingerprints or anything like that. And then flip around back and yes, that iPhone inspiration seems to be all the more apparent from the big old chunky square camera bumper. Though, I actually prefer the look of the Honor 400 Lite to the iPhone. I think there's a bit more style in here, a bit more flare. You've again got a matte surface in for the rear end, which can get a little bit grimy. Just have to give it a good old buffen up every now and then. And thankfully, that camera bump doesn't stick out too far from the back end. Although you will of course get the usual table jiggle. Overall, I think it looks pretty ruddy smart, especially again for this budget price point. You can grab the Honor 400 Lite in three different colors. This is the velvet black model. You can also grab it in velvet gray and Mars green with two Rs, which is a 1980s group responsible for that red hot 87 banger pump up the volume. I'm not really sure that's what Honor was going for. And so far, Touchwood, the Honor 400 Lite seems reasonably tough. Obviously, only been using it as my full-time phone for a few days, but even after just a few days, these plastic phones can sometimes scratch up a bit, especially down here near the bottom of the back end, but so far, no superficial damage whatsoever. You got a pre-installed screen protector slapped on there as well. Unfortunately, the Honor 400 Lite isn't fully water resistant, which is pretty rare at this sort of price point. It's IP64 splash and dust resistant. But these past few days, it's certainly got pretty damn moist. And as you can see there, absolutely no troubles. And in fact, even when the screen and your fingers are quite moist, it still works really well. Still surprisingly responsive. A lot more responsive than some flagships I've tested. Yes, including the likes of the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Now, when you want to actually turn on and use the Honor 400 lights where you've got an indisplay fingerprint sensor housed right there near the bottom edge of the display, of course, it is just your basic bog standard optical fingerprint sensor, but I've had absolutely zero aggro from this the past few days. It's perfectly responsive, if not quite the fastest acting optical sensor I've used. You've also got full face unlock support in backup, which seems to work really, really well even in completely dark environments. It doesn't even ever turn on the Wii selfie cam flash. Uh, which is probably just as well because it is slightly startling as we'll demonstrate later. And then once unlocked, you're straight into a tasty bit of Magic OS9. And Honor has not yet stipulated how many years of OS updates and security patching you can expect here on the 400 Lite, but I'd expect it to be around the sort of two or three. Don't expect, you know, six, seven years of support like what you would get with a Google or a Samsung smartphone, for instance. And that security patching is almost certainly going to be quarterly. And like most Android launches these days, Magic OS is pleasingly customizable. Can quickly and easily tweak the wallpaper, the icons, change up the lock screen style, etc., etc. Lots of different options to choose from. I did actually mess around with it a bit. Changed up the default font cuz I really wasn't a fan of the one that came on here originally. Plenty of animations, etc. to play around with. One of my only bug bears is the fact that the always on display isn't always on. Calls itself an always on display, but only actually displays when you prod the bugger. So, you know, that's one area where the iPhone 16 Pro actually beats the Honor 400 Lite cuz fair play to Apple. Their always on display is actually always on. But otherwise, Magic OS is packed with some pretty great features. It's quick and easy to enter split screen mode for a bit of multitasking, something you still can't do on those iPhones. Got a pretty slick gaming mode as well, which is packed with some really useful tools and features. Make sure you're not disturbed when you're getting your bit of Genchin on or whatever. And of course, like many mobile manufacturers, on it is balls deep and beyond when it comes to AI shenanigans. And the somewhat hilarious part is they seem to be doing just as good a job as Apple, if not better. So, for instance, you've got yourself a smart camera feature like the iPhone's so-called visual intelligence, except it's not actually. And that's because it uses Google image search by default rather than Apple. So, the Honor can identify pretty much anything gone, whereas the iPhone just about stretched to common house plants and cats. Even then, it was hesitant to commit at times. And the Honor 400 Lite also boasts the Magic Capsule, which is basically a straightup ripoff of Apple's floating turds and works in much the same way, spuffing out media controls when you need them, yada yada. And then there's also the magic portal, which basically has you dragging your knuckle around any image or whatever you want to do an AI type thing on. You can basically save these away to your favorites space for viewing and sharing later. Otherwise, you can just instantly share there and then using some of your favorite apps. And personally, got to admit, didn't really use this very often because the whole knuckle drag thing can be a bit hit and miss. Sometimes it just doesn't work at all. And frankly, you might as well just use good old Google circle to search because again, you can quickly and easily share an image as well as search for it. And you can even again share it to your favorite space. On top of that, of course, circle to search can identify tunes, translate text, etc. And with circle to search, it's much easier to translate any foreign speak that pops up on your smartphone as well. Although Honor AI does include a pretty decent interpretation tool as well, which can translate to and from English into a decent variety of alternative languages. There's no image generation bollocks or message rewriting shenanigans on here, which frankly I do not miss at all. It's just a complete waste of time and space. The only useful AI feature that Apple had on its iPhones, which you don't get on here, is the web summarization tool. That's basically it. And it's good news on the storage front as well, kiddies, because Honor has crammed 256 gigs of the stuff into the Honor 400 Lite. That's pretty bloody generous for a budget phone. And especially so when you consider that again Apple offers just a measly 128 gigs as standard in its iPhone 16 Pro, which can I remind you again costs a frigin grand. If you want to double that up to 256 gigs to match the Honor 400 L, well that's another£100 you'll have to slip into Timmy Cook's G-String. Now, another highlight of the Honor 400 Lite is the capacious 6.7 in AMOLED panels slapped across the front end. You got a 2412x 1080 pixel resolution. So, visuals reasonably crisp despite the size. And while there's bug roll HDR playback specified in apps like Netflix, you still get some lovely gorgeous eye pleasing contrast, some proper deep black, some crispy whites, really poppy colors as well, which can be tweaked in the display settings if you fancy. So certainly movies, games, animated fair in particular look absolutely stunning. It's just a shame about the slightly chunky selfie cam orifice, which does intrude on the action when you go full screen, much like those god-awwful iPhones. The display does get quite bright, although I did struggle to see the screen outside on a proper sunshiny day when I was wearing shades. I had to do the whole squinting underneath them to actually read my messages, etc. thing. But without shades, I can still see what was going on absolutely fine. And it's just if you are living somewhere that is a bit sunnier than Britain, so pretty much anywhere besides a cave 600 ft underground, you might possibly want to consider upgrading to a phone with a slightly brighter panel. If you are sensitive to a bit of OLED flicker, well, you got 3840 Hz PWM dimming on here, as well as all the usual eye comfort shenanigans as well, so it's good for a bit of that late night browsing. And you got support for up to 120 Hz refresh rate as well. So silky smooth. However, the audio side of things not quite as satisfying. One of the big disappointments of the Honor 400 Lite is the mono speaker arrangement. It's still reasonably loud when you max out the volume, but the quality overall is a bit meh. And of course, it's proper lopsided. So, yeah, you certainly won't want to listen to any music through this thing, although that goes pretty much standard for any smartphones as far as I'm concerned. And yeah, if you're just going to enjoy a bit of Netflix or whatever, definitely get some Bluetooth buds or headphones or something on the go. The wireless streaming's been almost perfect on this thing. I've had a couple of instances where the audio streamers just faded out just for a split second. Only happened a couple of times for me. Hopefully won't be a proper regular bug or quirk, but certainly worth noting. So, what's actually powering the Yona 400 L? Well, that would be MediaTek's Dimensity 7025 Ultra backed by 8 gigs of RAM. This Dmenity chipset is comparable to everyone's favorite budgety Snapdragon, the old 695. And it's the exact same chipset that was running the show on Xiaomi's Redmi Note 14 5G. And just like on that Redmi phone, I've got no idea why the chipset is referred to as ultra because it seems to have the exact same number of cores, the same clock speed, the same GPU, yada yada yada, as the regular Dimensity 7025. So, what's actually ultra about it? I'm assuming probably just a couple of little tweaks here and there to make it slightly more energy efficient would be my best guess. And one thing's for sure, the performance here has been absolutely fine. and it's been what you would expect from a budget smartphone, but it certainly ain't ultra. Occasionally, for instance, when you hit that power button, it can take a good second or so for the smartphone to actually power up, which is, yeah, it doesn't sound like much, but it can be slightly jarring. The camera can be a wee bit laggy as well. It's usually reasonably quick at swapping between the two main lenses, but the shutter speed sometimes not the fastest, especially when you're shooting portrait pics. The overall everyday running is fine, though, to be fair. And if you are a gamer where the likes of Call of Duty, PUBG, etc., other games that are well optimized play beautifully even on the higher graphics settings, you enjoy a silky smooth frame rate. And even games like Genchin Impact and Mother and Waves can run on this thing, but do not expect the same frame rate quality. You'll certainly notice a lot more jud and serious dips in that frame rate at times when things get a little bit hairy. So, I certainly see a limit yourself to stuff like the Call of Duties, the PUBG's where they're designed to run on more budget friendly smartphones. And the battery life here on the Honor 400 Light has been perfectly decent these last few days. You've got a 5,230 milliamp capacity cell crammed inside of that slender chassis, I believe. And then, of course, you got the energy efficient MediaTek chipset and everything as well. And I certainly found these past few days, I typically ended a fairly long busy day with around sort of 20 to 30% battery life remaining if I didn't lean too heavily on this thing. But once you start to introduce a bit of gaming, bit of camera action, then you will typically slip into that battery power saver mode before you finish the day all tucked up with Teddy. There was one day that I did almost kill it dead before bedtime, but that did involve like an hour of video chat action as well as just over an hour of Call of Duty and weather and waves action. So overall, decent battery life, but certainly not one of the best around. And where you do need to juice it back up again where you got 35 watt wired charging, which again far from the fastest around, but just as quick as a bloody iPhone to be fair. Although of course there's no wireless charging support here. So you are stuck to sticking a cable in the thing. And so kitties, let's conclude this rather smashing on a 400 light review with a squint at the camera tech. And it's a pretty straightforward dual lens arrangement here. You've got a 108 megapixel primary sensor and a basic 5 megapixel ultra wideangle shooter. So when you zoom in, you are just digitally cropping into the image because you got that massive 108 megapixel sensor. So you can zoom in up to about three times a lossless finish. But of course, the big whoop with the camera setup here on the Honor 400 Lite is the fact that you've got a dedicated camera button just like you did on the iPhone 16 Pro and the Oppo FindX 8 Pro. Now, if you give this a quick tap at any time, you will open up the camera app even when the phone is hibernating. You can gently squeeze the camera button to focus. And then if you fully push it in again, you will take a photo. You can also slide your finger across the surface of the camera button to zoom in and out. And it feels pleasingly responsive. Just the right level of sensitivity. It actually feels slightly more natural to use than the iPhone's camera button, which I really didn't get on with. But if I had to gripe about something, it's that once again, the positioning of the button is far too pushed in along that edge. I'd have much rather it was closer to the corner so you're not sort of stretching across to reach it. And that camera button pleasingly customizable as well. So you can completely deactivate it if you're not really a fan. You can toggle the whole press to launch the camera feature. You can change the in camera gestures as well. Once again deactivating the slide zoom and the tap to focus. You can also customize what pressing and holding the button will do. It actually records video by default, but I switch this up to a burst shoot mode. And as you can see there, you can even tweak the sensitivity if you want to. And the result is just a more enjoyable, more intuitive camera button experience. It's like they actually went out and tested it in real life. Now, photo capture generally follows the Apple and Samsung style of bright and bold rather than settling for more natural visuals. Some of my test shots suffered from the same saturation of colors. that you'd expect from iPhones, although the hefty processing doesn't usually wash out those lovely blue skies. HDR situations can be a bit of a struggle for the Honor 400 Lite, but it usually copes fine with more ambient conditions as long as your subject keeps reasonably still. And at least you got burst shot just a button push away, so you can capture loads of picss and just bin the duds. That sizable 108 meg sensor means you can zoom in around four to five times and still snap a reasonably detailed pick. while the ultra wide shooter suffers from a serious lack of sharpness. So, mostly just don't bother. And of course, you got all the bonus camera modes and features on here that you would expect, including a full-on pro mode where you can tinker with the ISO, the EV, etc. Although, there doesn't appear to be any love for a bit of raw action here. And if you want to shoot some home movies, well, sadly, there's no 4K option. You are limited to full HD 1080p at 30 frames pers. You may not get that crispy 4K finish, but for simple home movies, the Honor 400 Lite will do a serviceable job. The audio capture is mostly clean. Get the occasional wee bit of distortion if there's a lot of background noise or a bit of wind, for instance. And then flip around to the front end and you've got a 16 megapixel selfie camera. And yes, this does come kitted out with its very own LED flash. Now, you can once again capture up to 1080p full HD resolution video using that front-facing selfie cam. Again, no 4K option. The stabilization's okay. Occasionally a little bit shaky if you're not keeping your hand as still as possible. But yes, you can once again turn on that LED flash, get a bit of that on the go, which is fantastic if you want to shoot a bit of vlogging action somewhere dark like again maybe a nightclub or in this case a closet. And that right there, my lovelies, is my full final frank review of the Honor 400 Elite, a Bulgaras blow, which offers quite a bit for not much cash. Obviously, the performance is kind of limited here. You've only got a mono speaker setup, which is a major shame as well. But I tell you what, you got that gorgeous poppy AMOLED display, some pretty slick design, some respectable camera tech, and yes, quite a lot of iPhone style design and features packed in here as well. But in many cases, the Honor actually does it better. Certainly when it comes thanks to the camera button and the general AI shenanigans. That's what I reckon. Anyway, it' be great to hear your thoughts on the Honor 400 Light down in the comments below. Please do poke subscribe and ding that notifications bell for more on the latest and greatest tech. And have yourselves a ruddy wonderful rest of the week. Cheers everyone. Love you. [Music]",2,The video primarily focuses on comparing the Honor 400 Lite with the iPhone 16 Pro

It's super simple and clean. Number two, the screen is leagues better than what was on the previous iPhone SE. This is an edgetoedge super retina XDR OLED panel that ditches the home button for a much more immersive look, but alas still at a disappointing 60 Hz refresh rate. Now, the phone is rocking Apple's A18 chip, making the iPhone 16e quite a powerhouse in terms of performance.

I've had it for about 24 hours. Here's everything that you need to know. First and foremost, the Pixel 9a uses the updated form factor that Google introduced with the Pixel 9 with this popular industrial look. And without question, this is the best put together Pixel 8 device the company has ever made. It has a striking similarity to the Pixel 9 despite missing the signature camera bar. And even though the back of this phone is made out of plastic, I swear you would never know because it doesn't feel cheap at all. It comes in a variety of different colors. I went with this PE color that I think looks great. Super punchy and saturated. It's using the same 1080p OLED panel with a 120 Hz variable refresh rate as the Pixel 9. And it's also equipped with the new Tensor G4 chip. You get two cameras on the back and one in the front. And all of this could be yours for a very reasonable starting price tag of $499.

goes and surprises Us by sending their long awaited update to the arc and yeah no way I'm making you all wait for it this time now we still have the original Sonos Arc so I was able to do quite a bit of head-to-head testing between the OG and the new arc Ultra which is a 9.1.4 Dolby Atmos capable sound S Bar on the surface the two bars look pretty similar you still have your choice of two finishes matte black or white however the newer Ultra is shaped a little bit differently and weighs less than the original now inside the arc Ultra the first update we see is the inclusion of three additional drivers bringing its total to 14 whereas the OG Arc had 11 powered by 15 internal amplifiers the Ultras drivers are split into seven silk Dome tweeters six mid-range drivers and a new sound motion w ER which is Sonos new driver design that extends the ultra's bass response and according to Sonos doubles the ultra bass output compared to the original and like the original Arc you can expand the ultra by adding two of sons's era speakers for surround sound and up to two subwoofers to give you more base similar to the original the ultra input options are still pretty limited you get HDMI with Arc e Arc and ethernet and while there is a way to use an optical input you do have to use an adapter that is sold separately and work Works more in conjunction with your TV than the bar itself since the original Arc was limited in terms of physical connections to make setup as simple as possible I'm not really surprised to see it again here in the ultra as for wireless options the ultra has Wi-Fi and AirPlay 2o plus Sonos adds Bluetooth 5.3 something that was missing from the original Arc of course you can interact with a host of streaming music services such as title and even Apple Music natively Inside the Sonos app you can use Sonos as voice control or third Party Services like Alexa or Google Assistant for even more control flexibility once you have your Ultra connected setup of the bar itself is done inside the Sonos app speaking of the app Sonos has been in the news a lot this year and at the center of it all was that app I'm not going to rehash what went down suffice to say I understand if you may be weary about buying into an ecosystem whose functionality is primarily dictated by an app especially after the almost complete failure of sonus app earlier this year and while I may not be able to change your mind or convince you to give Sonos another shot I can tell you that during our testing the Sono app worked flawlessly and allowed for easy setup of the arc Ultra and other Sonos speakers as for streaming music with the app I had no issues with apple music or title with all of your speakers set up inside the app it's going to prompt you to run the true playroom correction Now using the mic on your phone the app walks you through the 90-second process of tuning all of your connected Sonos speakers in my case that was an an arc Ultra two a300s and two Sonos subs and it's going to tune them to each other and then to your room and when it comes to Auto room calibration true play is just so simple and easy to use in my honest opinion it is the gold standard if other Home Theater manufacturers want to capture that you know all important younger demographic and finally compete with sound barss they're going to need to find a way to replicate this experience and quick while the before and after results of true play are more subtle than transformative I always preferred The Arc sound after running true play now before I get into the sound of the full Sonos system I want to talk about the sound of the Ultra Bar all on its own directly compared to the original two things about the ultra's performance are immediately noticeable it plays deeper and in a far more linear and neutral fashion and overall the bar is just less peaky in the bass and treble The Arc Ultra sounds more balanced from top to bottom with smoother transitions As you move from the base to the mid-range on up to the treble it is a far more neutral bar so it will pair well with an even wider range of music and movies there's a more gradual and smooth upper mid-range and treble rolloff making the ultra better at playing back at those higher volumes too and the measurements more than confirm my subjective listening test head-to-head it's clear how the ultra maintains a more neutral or linear response from top to bottom we can see that at the listening position and near field the ultra bass extends just a bit more than the original Arc the upper mid-range and treble aren't as boosted or as energetic resulting in an overall response that's going to sound more neutral and balanced and the ultra can play Back 40 HZ audio at in room volumes exceeding 75db with 35 Hertz still audible I'll be around 3 to 5 DB lower so for some listeners particularly those of you with smaller rooms a subwoofer may not be necessary and considering the ultr soundar cost just under $1,000 it's a great choice for people on a budget or those with limited space but still want a fantastic sounding home theater system unlike Ultra expensive Soundbars like the Nakamichi Dragon the ultra delivers on its promises but if you want more from the bar you can adjust the bass and treble using tone control options inside the app but even out of the box the ultra is one hell of a balanced Soundbar I listen to a lot of music using title from inside the Sonos app everything from rock bands like a perfect circle to the lastlings electronic pop to jazz artists like lady Blackbird all sounded real good there are no musical genre limitations here the ultra's overall tone detail and control those were on par with many loudspeakers within its price bracket keep in mind we are still talking about the bar by itself it is not able to keep Pace with the traditional pair of stereo speakers in the imaging department of course this only applies to listening to music and is easy to explain traditional stereo tracks through a soundbar are going to be more Center focused so traditional stereo Imaging is just easier to achieve when you can place some separation between the speakers since a soundbar is going to be limited by its physical boundaries it's difficult for Imaging to extend more than say a foot or two beyond the bar now this isn't a deal breaker for me especially if we're talking about casual or background music listening however for more critical listening I can see how a single Arc Al may not convince every Hi-Fi Enthusiast to make the leap and ditch their traditional stereo speakers for a soundbar but stay with me when I shift my musical selections from strict stereo mixes to newer music or recordings mastered in Atmos the experience with the ultra changes significantly with no need for adjustments Atmos mixed tracks like Unholy reveal the true potential of this bar creating a near 360° sound experience the base is strong but not over overwhelming maintaining quality at levels up to 85 to 90 DB in room now Beyond this volume Sonos similar to b o may be activating a limiter to prevent Distortion or clipping and I feel the same for movies on its own the ultra recreated enough of that cinematic gravitas during the fight between Deadpool and Wolverine that just oh the scale Dimension and depth of the ultrasound was just impressive the intelligibility also outstanding even without the ultra's new adjustable speech enhancements enabled and this is noteworthy considering that Deadpool wears a full face mask and talks while fighting through just absolute chaos Ryan Reynolds is still super easy to understand while the ultra fell short in terms of deep Bas extension and intense Dynamics it's actually a tossup if the end user will necessarily consider this a drawback because not everyone is seeking that kind of experience or even wants it for themselves after trying it and real quick going back to the now adjustable speech enhancement feature the ultra gives you three settings of dialogue adjustment on the first gen Arc you simply had the option to turn Dialogue on or off now you have low medium and a high setting now in my testing low was almost too subtle to register medium great middle ground with the high setting being a near fact simile to The Originals just on setting I found the ultra to be intelligible all on its own but if you need a little help in that department you now have options but there is a way to unlock an even better experience if you already own say era 100s or you want that full Atmos experience because you got era 300s and you own a sub or you have the budget to add them prepare to have to spend at least double the roughly $2500 cost of like a fully kitted out Sono system if you want to better what Sonos has brought to Market here watching some of my go-to scenes from Deadpool Wolverine top gun Maverick and ambulance was so good and so immersive on the ultra a pair of era 300s and a Sono subw we actually have both the New Gen 4 and older gen 3 sub by the way that it would take a system anchored by something like the SVS Titans and the S sp7 subwoofer paired with a capable receiver for me to even consider a traditional home theater setup over something like the all Sono system in 2024 I will admit SS's Big Boy s sp7 is the better subwoofer and my Titans they hit those Dynamic snaps with the authority of an angry ruler wielding nun but between the gold post and at volumes with Peaks hitting around 90 to maybe 95 DB in room the son's Arc Ultra surround sound system left me wanting for absolutely nothing what was even more surprising was that the era 300s did a better job at creating a larger and just more spacious surround sound sound stage than our overhead Clips in seiling speakers a demo I was able to carry out using the Sonos amp which I used to power our rear in seiling speakers paired to the Ultra in lie of the era 300s in fact using the AA 300s with the ultra did a fantastic job placing sounds overhead and I'm talking far out to the sides something I experience watching movies and while listening to the song Unholy I'm not sure that song has ever sounded better in our room than it did through the Sonos system and real quick Sonos is new sub Gen 4 is excellent and in my opinion is a bit of an improvement over the outgoing gen 3 physically the two subs look almost identical they are the same size even though the older sub is heavier the four comes in a matte black instead of the three's glossy finish now the four sounds a little less boomy it handles extreme volumes better and has a smoother rolloff as you reach its limits which in our room Pro to be around 25 Hertz at reference volumes between 75 and 80 DB for comparison's sake that's more or less on par with SVS is $700 small and super stylish micro 3000 and it is demonstrably better than Ami's quote new and improved subwoofers which cost more than $1,000 each and while we're on the topic of Subs you can add two subwoofers to the ultra whether that's two of the New Gen 4S or two gen 3s or one of each true play does a great job balancing the base between them so that everyone is going to enjoy Maximum Impact one sub is enough but two takes the entire system to another level as pleased as I am with the new arc Ultra on its own there are a few things I hope hope to see in future iterations or maybe tackled in a firmware update first up I would like to see an additional HDMI port I get the Sonos is trying to keep things simple but having another HDMI input or two would make adding things like a streamer a gaming console or Blu-ray player a lot more convenient rather than Force customers to run additional HDMI cables to their TV since some users may need the optical audio adapter i' like to see Sonos include one in the Box you know to avoid any unforeseen headaches for first time users or those who they just may be a little bit light on funds and unable to upgrade their TV along with purchasing a new Soundbar also and this is nothing new it would be nice if Sonos products could you know see DTS signals the same way they do Dolby there are only a few products that come close to what the Sonos Ultra system can do two of them just so happen to be the ones I know you're going to ask about most so leading off with the goat the q990 D from Samsung it is still the best value when it comes to Soundbars for a little more than the cost of the Sonos Ultra on its own in other words with no additional Sonos components the Samsung delivers a great user experience while also providing you with a full surround sound Dolby Atmos system if your budget tops out at what the Samsung will run you the q990 D is still the way to go however when comparing the bars the ultra is the better sounding and just more full range bar if you can spring for the extras I'm talking a pair of Sonos era 300s and a sub Gen 4 the full Sonos experience Monsters the Samsung it ain't even close now one of my favorite products in 2024 is the Sony Bravia theater quad when paired with the no it's not optional people Sony sw5 subwoofer a complete Sono system costs about the same head-to head the Sony is better in one area that likely matters most to audio files and that is Stereo listening unlike the single bar Ultra the quad system uses four separate loudspeakers the stereo separation you get with individual speakers is hard to beat when delivering a more traditional Hi-Fi experience aside from the quad's music listening experience and its additional input output options which are a total bonus don't hate me I prefer the overall neutral tone and tuning of the full Arc Ultra system even saying that some of you may still favor Sony's more Dynamic and treble leaning sound but beyond their differences in sound the Sony kit it out system it's just more flexible than the quad's closed one which by the way is still limited to a single subwoofer not only can you expand the ultra but you can pair and unpair the Sonos surrounds and sub from the bar if you want to use them somewhere else in your home later and it's really hard to kind of ignore that level of convenience and one thing I will advocate for is going ahead and adding a second sub to your Sonos system if your budget in your room allow with two subs it's not even a fair contest the Sony sw5 just can't keep Pace with two Sonos Subs the quad don't get me wrong it is a phenomenal home theater alternative but considering these systems fully kitted out are roughly the same price the Sonos is man they're that team that just always nails that buzzer beater to win the game but I'm sure a lot of you are here to learn whether you should upgrade your original Arc to the ultra look if you already own the original Arc and it's still working for you please do not stress yourself out and succumb to foam you still have a damn good Soundbar and with that out of the way the ultra is the better and more flexible solution so if you've skipped to this section and you are wondering what makes the ultra better and more flexible surprise you're going to have to actually watch the video and as for how the Sonos system Stacks up against other bars I think the writing is on the wall the complete Sonos Arc Ultra system is nicer more functional more compact cheaper and still better than the dragon with or without its new but still can't do subwoofers even the Bose Ultra Bar which I love and I know still holds christe's intelligibility Crown even that's outgunned by the new Ultra and if we're building a full Bose soundbar home theater the Sonos destroys it B surrounds just can't compete against a pair of era 300s and you already know that I am not about to recommend a Wall's new thunderbeat because it doesn't live up to its own hype and I can't really comment on seny because it's just been too long so unless you have the space and even the funds to invest close to I'm going to say five grand for a traditional home theater system I don't think you can outright beat what Sonos has brought to Market here so that's it that is now my take on sons' brand new arc Ultra Soundbar and a little bit of the sub Gen 4 as well as the complete Sonos surround system what did you guys think do you think I'm crazy for thinking that this can outper form home theaters in and around its price point that you'd have to probably spend upwards of I don't know five grand to just outright beat it I want to know so sound off down below if you have any questions or maybe I missed a comparison that you would also like me to touch upon uh feel free to also leave that down below because you never know could end up in next week's unplugged where we find out what Christy thinks of the new Sono system until then if you like this video please do give it a thumbs up like And subscribe go ahead and ring that Bell so that you're notified when new videos

based on the music you can hear in the background bonus points to you because it is of course Command and Conquer remastered on the steam deck oh that music is Iconic but we're here to talk about the x- real ones because I've been using X re for years now we had the A's the air2 air2 pros even going back to the N reels before they changed their name a few years ago but here we are with the new ones so the xre ones are their latest generation of AR glasses well they call it AR in my mind it's not really augmented reality you're not interacting with the world around you there's nothing sort of coming up on screen that's augmented really what it is is just a big virtual monitor in front of your eyes it's kind of like sticking a screen about this size about that far away from your face and then this can be your phone or your laptop your games console it's an external monitor for your eyes although it may become more augmented over time they did dabble with this uh with the air2 ultra which was kind of meant more for developers and also more expensive but this will also eventually support a modular plug-in camera so kind of turning it into like meta rayb bands and they've also said we're going to see some llms some large language model AIS incorporated into this so down the road we may see some actual augmented reality out of these but in the meantime they're essentially just a big cinema screen for your face and all you do is plug in your games console whether it's your steam deck your R Ally or your PS5 or whatever your mobile phone or your PC as long as it supports USBC and display out and and then you've got it mirrored or extended right in front of your eyes so now I'm looking at a equivalent to 147 in at a 4 M distance OLED display right in front of my eyes and because we have this transparency mode this electrochromic dimming which used to be exclusive to the air2 pro model but now we have it on the X real one with a press you can block out pretty much all the light in front of you so you've got a really crisp smooth big bright screen in front of you these are epic but what exactly is new with these X real ones well I'd say there's eight key upgrades number one the fact that we have a new chip their first custom in-house built X1 chip which unlocks a whole bunch of features which we'll come to a second number two we also have brighter screens last year it peaked at 500 nits of perceived brightness now we've got 600 nits on the XR 1's and actually 700 on the upcoming XR 1 pros number three as I say we've got that wider field of view now 50° up from 46 although the X 1 Pro coming in a few months will actually boost that up to 57° number four we have the chromic dimming which previously as I say was exclusive to the Pro Models so you don't need to pop on a fiddly plastic light block anymore we also now have the anchor mode built into the glasses previously you'd have to have the X beam accessory plugged into it but because of that new X1 chip it's built into the glasses so you've got the three modes follow and as I give you a bit of a visual representation of this because it's extremely hard to film through the glasses and you can't record from the glasses follow mode basically keeps the image directly in front of my eyes wherever I'm looking but if I then switch to Anchor mode it then pins that screen that image in that same space within my 3D World so I can move around I can look around and then come back to it and it remains there why might you want that well let's say you've got your laptop screen in front of you and then you could have your extended screen on top or off to one side or if you're gaming and you want to plant the screen like a TV would be on your wall or something in one particular location and this is the first time we can do this through the glasses themselves with the X1 chip because previously you need the separate xbam accessory to give you this what they call three do three do or dimensions of freedom and then finally number three we have side view where you can basically shrink down your screen and then that's sort of great for navigation if you want to follow Google Maps but you can still see your surroundings in front of you so follow anchor which is new for these built-in and side view they've refined the design with a new spring hinge so it doesn't pinch or put as much pressure on your head they've also made the frame a little bit sleeker although it is a touch heavier at 84 G up from 72 on last year's air2 and of course that's without the USBC cable which comes bundled one side plugs into the back of the glasses on the left side the other into your device so this is essentially what you have on your face which is a whole lot lighter and more comfortable than a meta Quest or an apple Vision Pro they've also added an extra button on the frame along with much improved speakers they've actually collaborated with Bose to improve the audio and there's also a new very convenient in glasses menu for adjusting the screen size and distance you can customize button shortcuts there's tutorials audio settings and a whole bunch more I'm actually going to cheat a little bit because I've got my laptop here my MacBook I'm plugging in to the USBC port and it's immediately mirrored to my eyes and I'm not sure if you can see the difference when I go between the transparency mode so I can now see you uh and then turn on the full electrochromic dimming there's actually three levels of the dimming you can switch between but most of the time I like it blacked out as much as possible so I can actually do a super saf who of course always wears his glasses and read the script but also look at you in the camera and you wouldn't know but to my eyes at least no pun intended this is actually a really big upgrade the wider field of view the electrochromic dimming not just on the pro model and what that X1 chip allows essentially it's incorporating the X beam which gives you the anchor mode which I can switch between anchor and follow just with a single press of this red button I can also double press it to bring up this new menu which is actually very helpful but of course you are still limited to One display yes you can have an ultra wide and if you're plugging into your laptop you can have multiple tabs and windows open within your you know mirrored or extended screen but it's still One display in front of you that's still a 50° fi of view I say still that's off from 46 but you're still looking at you know a frame of about that in front of your eyes and you can change the size of your virtual screen down to about 32 in or all the way up to over 400 in although at a certain point over about 140 in the field of view becomes a limitation and essentially you're just zooming in on the screen but you'll then need to turn your head head to actually see the edges of the screen and I'm also pleased to report because they've improved the Optics engine and also with this new X1 chip even coming from the air2 pros everything looks crisper Everything feels smoother and they've drastically improved the response time or more specifically the motion to Photon latency or the m2p from 20 milliseconds down to just 3 milliseconds honestly the stabilization the clarity of these X 1es fantastic and they're the first pair of quote unquote AR glasses to receive a five-star eye Comfort certification so I can comfortably watch a movie or edit my videos with really no eye strain I am someone who gets a little bit motion sick using VR and AR glasses but I've never had an issue with these even taking them on planes and bumpy trains I'm happy to edit and work and watch movies on this and I've never had an issue with feeling nauseous or motion sick and because it is obviously powered by the device you're plugging into it doesn't run out of battery now of course the device may run out of battery but the flip side of that is let's say I'm on the plane one of the places I use this all the time I can actually dim my screen right down save a whole bunch of battery there and because my 16in MacBook rarely fits on a tray table on a plane or a train I can also you know dip it down have the screen dimmed and then kind of use it like a Vision Pro and work this way with my big virtual screen so in the Box you have this little uh glasses case for the X reels which pop in there nicely a lens cloth you've also got this USBC cable and essentially if you wrap the that around there that's all you need just take that with you everywhere you go and you're set it also comes with lens frame inserts if you want to put your prescription lens in there which actually I might do because I find my eyesight has been getting a little bit worse over the last couple of years so I might actually do that and also while these are for me very comfortable out of the box you can also switch out these nose pads and there are two other sizes in the Box plus they also Flex quite nicely so you can uh pop them on your face just maybe push up a little bit depending on your nose I've got quite a big nose and like before these what are they call handles these are the frames what what are these call anyway these things have three levels of adjustment still a bit of a horrible cracking sound there but you can adjust how the frames how the lenses sit on your face one thing that hasn't really changed though is glare I'm actually as I'm looking you're now still getting a nice white reflection of this table underneath so depending on what sort of down here I am seeing that kind of glaring into the bottom of the frames which can be a bit distracting and as good as the electrochromic dimming is which of course needs to be plugged in to activate it's still a pair of sunglasses so all this light is still going to be coming into your eyes so you're not getting like a fully immersive blacked out Vision Pro experience unless you put a bag over your head or something but for a pair of glasses works really well and it is comfortable so that's just a bit of a first look at the new X real ones this isn't a full review because actually this is running pre-release software there will be a day one update if you buy one of these and I'll revisit it then although I might also wait for the X real one Pros which are I'm told coming out q1 2025 5 uh and as I say come with a brighter screen wider field of view which I'm excited about but still these x1's very nice upgrade over the a twos and even the had2 pros to be honest I love the fact we don't have to mess around with the x-beam anymore and if you do just want a pair of essentially chunky sunglasses that give you a incredible cinematic screen in front of you for your phone your laptop your games console whatever it may be you can't go wrong with a pair of x-rs the downside there is a downside these are more expensive a fair bit more expensive than last year starting at $499 I think that's the same in pound and dollars for these X 1es I think it's going to be $599 for the X one pro so 100 more for that which I think is about 100 150 more than the air2 and the air2 pros were but what do you reckon could you see yourself rocking a pair of these with a nice big screen in front of your face let me know what you make of the xra ones and if you'd be tempted to pick one up thank you so much for watching guys if you enjoyed this video a cheeky like And subscribe would be fantastic and I'll see you next time right here on the tech chat,1,The video

the United States that might still be generally true things are changing but it's not because Samsung phones have gotten worse on the contrary they've consistently gotten better it's just that now there's more competition and Samsung isn't innovating as much and that's sort of the problem that I have with the s25 ultra it's an incredible phone in almost every way but it really doesn't feel that different than the s24 ultra in a lot of ways it's kind of like the newest iPhone phone of Android so I've been using Samsung's latest top-of-the-line flagship phone the s25 ultra for the last 2 weeks and in today's video I'm going to tell you whether this phone is worth it I really meant what I said I feel like the Samsung s25 Ultra is the iPhone of the Android world it's the safe Choice it's the one that you know that if you buy it you're going to be happy but you also know you're going to spend a lot of money for a phone that's very similar to last year's phone and as a longtime Apple user I'm kind of used to that I'm used to spending $1,200 on the newest phone that has like one new feature over the previous phone and unfortunately that's exactly what's happening with the s25 ultra I spent $1,300 on this phone and it's very similar to the s24 ultra but I really don't want to spend the whole review talking about that I'm sure if you've watched other reviews you know already that this is a very slight iterative improvement over the previous phone that said if you're looking for a new Android phone or a new Samsung Ultra phone this is the only way to go the s25 ultra is incredible I mean it's an allaround astounding phone but let's first talk about what you've got going on under the hood in this phone you've got a Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor which is incredibly fast this chipset is actually one of the biggest upgrades from last year's phone it is significantly faster we're talking 35 to 40% faster in certain applications when it comes to gaming the s25 ultra is incredibly fast I mean it's mind-blowingly fast it handled every single game that I threw at it with no issues and not only can It handle a lot of the top-of-the-line games currently it's also pretty much future proofed because you're getting a very very powerful processor that should last you a long time in addition to the processor you also get 12 GB of RAM which give you a very Snappy experience overall I had no lag whatsoever on this phone it was incredibly fast and noticeably faster than my s24 ultra with games so if you're looking for the latest and greatest and fastest Samsung phones the s25 ultra really is the way to go now you did hear that right all of the new s25 is do feature the same processor no matter whether you're grabbing the s25 the s25 Plus or the s25 ultra and they all also feature 12 GB of RAM so there really isn't that big of a difference between the current lineup however compared to previous phones it is a pretty big step up now getting to onboard storage it's very similar to what you had in previous years you've got a 256 GB option which is what I have here a 512 and if you're willing to spend the money a one terabyte option now I personally store a lot of my photos and videos on the cloud and I pay for the cloud service so I don't actually need that extra storage but sometimes it's nice to have especially if you're filming and log which we'll talk about later now let's get this out of the way right out of the gate unfortunately this phone is still very expensive like last year's version it's starts at $1,300 which is not cheap but this is a flagship phone we will talk about whether you should get this phone or or last year's phone later on in the video because obviously you can get last year's phone for cheaper especially if you're buying it used but I will say $1,300 is a tough pill to swallow for a minor upgrade over last year's version and of course if you decide to upgrade the internal storage from 256 to 512 or even a terabyte the price will go up in tears along with that but now let's talk about the screen the beautiful honestly gorgeous screen now one of the changes that Samsung made from the s24 ultra to the s25 ultra was changing the size of the screen from 6.8 in to 6.9 in really the way that they did that was by changing the external shape of the phone and also the size of the bezels so the bezels got a little bit thinner and that's really just because the shape of the phone changed a little bit as you can see this year Samsung opted for much flatter edges similar to what you have on the iPhone obviously the Curves in the corner are not as rounded as you have on an iPhone so you do get a little bit more diagonal space there compared to last year's s24 Ultra I actually do kind of prefer this design I feel like it's a little bit more Sleek a little bit more professional feeling and I really like the way it feels in the hand the edges aren't as rounded so I think some people prefer the more rounded edges because they feel like it fits a little bit better in the hand but for myself and I'm sure most of you I use it with a case I have it out of the case for the review so the actual physical feeling of the edges doesn't usually affect me I will say though that visually I really really love the way that this phone looks especially in this black color which is actually only available on Samsung's website I bought this for the full $1,300 on Samsung's website and I think it looks gorgeous very similar to last year's version but still gorgeous I mean let's be honest the iPhone hasn't looked different in what 5 years so you can't really fault Samsung for just kind of maintaining their design language on this device the screen itself is 3120 X 1440 it's an AMOLED display and looks absolutely incredible the display also comes with a variable refresh rate of 1 to 120 Herz which means swiping back and forth is buttery smooth on this phone and you can save battery life when you're not using it really great to have that really love that feature and like last year's s24 Ultra this phone does also feature that anti-reflective coating which looks amazing you can sort of see it in the light I think on the s25 ultra it's the second generation Corning Gorilla Glass reducing coding or whatever it's called it doesn't seem to be that different than the s24 but it is really nice to have and it's a night and day difference between an iPhone genuinely when you use his phone outside it's incredible and even in the studio where I've got a ton of Lights it really does a great job of stopping that glare it's it's amazing obviously for media consumption and gaming the screen looks absolutely incredible I actually prefer this more squared off display to the iPhone display because it allows you to have a much more natural viewing experience you don't have the cut off edges like you have with the iPhone especially when you zoom into the display now I will say I don't love the P hole camera in the center of the display I've never loved pinhole cameras they just kind of take away from the clean aesthetic of the phone but uh you know all phones have that nowadays so there's not really much you can do about it but talking about the physical design of this phone you've really only got two buttons on the right side you've got a volume rocker on the top and then a power on and off button just below that I don't love the volume rocker being right above the power button I kind of like having it on one side and then the power button on the other side but I also kind of like having nothing on this side so you know there's pluses and minuses to everything the phone feels incredibly premium in the hand as it should for a $1300 phone now again I put a case on it so I don't really feel it but having it outside of the case feels great on the bottom of the phone you got your sim card tray you've got your USBC and you've also got your S Pen on the left side right here oddly enough it comes in a tan color uh which is odd because the phone itself is black at least my phone is the S Pen still does S Pen like things except it's not as capable as previous s pens and that's because the S Pen no longer has bluetooth support which if you liked yes I've got I know I've got it the S Pen still does pretty much all of your S Pen like things which is good if you like using your S Pen the one thing it can't do anymore is remote shutter because it doesn't have bluetooth support which means if you want to take a photo you know standing from a distance you can't do that anymore with the SP pen which is like the only thing that I use the Spen for so it's kind of a bummer now granted I didn't use the S Pen for that much but it is kind of a bummer that I lost that feature but now let's get into battery life because that's one of those things that people wonder about and worry about when they buy a new phone is my phone going to last all day and in the case of the s25 Ultra with the 5,000 mAh battery that you get yeah it'll last you all day generally I found that this phone gave me 12 to 15 hours of consistent use which is basically a day and a half without charging I watch a lot of YouTube generally on my TV or on my laptop or on my phone so that's kind of split between different devices when I use this just for YouTube I got around 15 to 20 hours it's not like a perfect test cuz I didn't sit there with the phone on I just kind of recorded whenever I watched YouTube and then paused when I stopped watching YouTube but uh it's a pretty decent battery is it as good as last year's phone for my own testing it seems very similar to last year's phone I don't know if it's exactly the same if it's better or if it's worse but it's very capable it's all I need and I don't have any qualms whatsoever with the battery life as far as charging goes you can get up to 45 watts of wired charging which can charge your phone in just over an hour from 0 to 100 wireless charging unfortunately is limited to just 15 watts so it's a much slower process also this phone is ch2 capable which means you can use ch2 Chargers unfortunately though this phone does not come with the magnets that you need to actually Center the wireless charger or connect the wireless charger like you have with iPhones and mag safe so uh while it is capable of using that uh standard you can't actually use the magnets unless you put on a specific case for it which is very odd that said though after years of having wireless chargers in my car in my office in my bedroom I really always tend to use wired Chargers just cuz they charge faster and uh I also have those right next to my wireless chargers I just never really use the wireless chargers so for me doesn't really matter that much I'm sure it's different for everybody but for me I I don't really use wireless chargers but now let's talk about the cameras on this phone and in a lot of ways they are very similar to last year's cameras which is kind of the case for almost everything on this phone you've got a 50 megapixel telephoto and a 10 megapixel telephoto but where this phone really shines and the biggest upgrade that they've made to this phone is the brand new 50 megapix Ultra wide lens and this is something I actually asked for last year I film a lot of videos on my phone and I found that the ultrawide setting is one that I actually use in a very regular basis so to add a 50 megapixel Ultra wide is great especially when I'm filming like this or just filming myself it just is so much easier to frame the shot when there's a way bigger frame so that's great to have and as you would expect from a Samsung phone it takes incredible photos now I've taken some photos here to give you guys an idea of how the photos look and I've compared them against an iPhone 16 Pro Max to show you sort of what the differences are between the two phones because in my mind these are the two best cameras that you can buy on phones in the current American Market I think they look incredible I still personally prefer the color accuracy of the iPhone over the Samsung the Samsung s25 Ultra well I think the camera looks better than the s24 ultra because I don't think the colors are as saturated it still seems a tad oversaturated over the iPhone I feel like the iPhone still takes more true to life photos but hey if you prefer the way that the s25 ultra looks more power to you I still think it's a great camera phone and I still think the zooms are better in the s25 ultra over the iPhone now when it comes to video kind of the same deal I still prefer the iPhones video I still feel like it's a little bit more natural I still think it looks a little bit better but it's really your own opinion all right so this is what a vlog looks and sounds like on the Samsung Galaxy s25 Ultra what do you guys think do you think it's sounds good do you think it looks good let me know in the comments section down below all right so this is what a vlog looks and sounds like on the iPhone 16 Pro Max do you prefer this do you prefer the Samsung let me know in the comments but honestly I would be fine with either I think they both look incredible and if I only had one I'd be happy but I really can't say this enough the Samsung s25 Ultra has incredible cameras like it doesn't get much better than this so I don't know it's tough now one brand new feature on the s25 ultra is the ability to now film in log which let's be honest when it comes out of the camera it doesn't look great it just looks all gray but but the reason that it looks like that is because it's actually storing more data of the highlights and the low lights than a standard video file would which means that after you film something you can actually put it into editing software and really get exactly the color that you want and the highlights and the low lights that you want you can't really do that with standard video files now this is something that the iPhone's been able to do for a little bit so it's not a brand new feature and obviously it's something that DSLR cameras have been able to do for a very long time but I will say it is very nice to have on the s25 ultra and you can actually do autocolor correction on this phone directly on the phone it's itself which you can't do with the iPhone now that said like I mentioned earlier I film almost all of my Vlogs on my phones and I actually don't film and log and the reason for that is because log creates significantly larger video files than a standard video file and for me I'm only posting my Vlogs on YouTube or on social media so I don't need ridiculously high resolution videos on either of those platforms I use 4K but I don't need like the ultimate color correction so for me I don't think the trade-off in video size is worth it for the adjustability in highlights and low lights for a lot of people it is though for me I just don't need that ultimate adjustability when it comes to highlights and low lights so I'm fine with just the standard video output that comes out of either phone I will say though it's really nice to have the option and if I was to post something on I guess a more high-end platform like maybe a float plane or a I don't know like in a movie theater maybe I'd use log but I just don't feel like I need it I actually have never used float plane in my life I have no idea if it's a more highend platform or not but there you go an additional feature that the s25 ultra has is the new AI audio eraser which allows you to erase background noise while you're you're filming it's pretty cool it's not groundbreaking it's not amazing but it's something that can be upgraded through software in the future so it probably will get better now of course being a phone released in 2025 it's got a lot of AI features the iPhone has a lot of AI features the Samsung phones have a lot of AI features all the ones he had in last year's phone they're still there you've still got Circle to search you've still got uh item removal from photos there's a lot of AI features that are actually genuinely useful on this phone but honestly none that I really use on a regular basis personally maybe you're different but I don't really use them the only one that I use on a semi-regular basis is circle to search now it's not one that I need because on iPhone you can literally just upload a photo to Google and it'll do the same thing but it is nice to be able to Circle something on a website and be like what is that or maybe take a photo of something and be like what bug is that or what shoe is that cuz you guys know I love sneakers so that's a nice touch but it's on every Android phone and you can do it with the Google app on your iPhone so it's not a huge deal obviously there are a ton of other AI features which I could talk about like translate which is actually amazing if you go to a different country I just went to Saudi Arabia worked great but there's nothing really new or groundbreak that I thought was worth mentioning personally let me know in the comment section down below if there are any AI features that you love about the s25 ultra that I should have mentioned some other nice ones I guess are call summaries and YouTube summarization and of course Gemini is 10 times better than Siri I mean it's it's night and day sure I can say things like take a photo with the front facing camera it's loading I think it will though I'm not able to help with that as I'm only a language model all right well it's worked before that's embarrassing that's said out of all all the AI software that I've used it seems like Google is kind of on top when it comes to AI smart Assistance or virtual assistance so if that's what you're looking for go Android over iPhone there you go so like I said at the beginning of the review the Samsung s25 Ultra is an excellent allaround phone in pretty much every regard the battery life solid the cameras incredible the power of this phone I mean it's unmatched especially within Androids well that might not be totally true but it's very very powerful the screen absolutely gorgeous the anti-reflective coding is actually incredible it's better than any phone that I've ever ever used the face unlock the fingerprint sensor there's so many things about this phone that have been perfected and I think in a lot of ways that's really what the s25 ultra is it's the best version of the S phone ever it's absolutely incredible this is my go-to Android phone now with that being said is the value there is this a $1,300 phone well in my opinion if you have a phone that's older than maybe the s22 or maybe you don't have an Android phone or maybe you don't have a Samsung this is a phone to go with it's worth the $1,300 however if you own something like the s23 ult ra or the s24 ultra there's honestly no reason to upgrade and if you're trying to be a bit more budget conscious if you could find an s24 ultra for a significantly better price I say go that way it's still got seven years of updates just like this phone it's still going to be very capable for many years to come and I really think that other than the minor design changes and also the upgraded processor there's not much about this phone that warrants an upgrade so yes if you're looking to get into the Samsung ecosystem if you're looking for the best of the best Samsung phone or maybe you have an older Samsung S device than the s25 all Ultra is absolutely worth it if you already have an s24 or s23 late for the next one but hey if you made it to this point in the video let me know in the comment section down below what you think of the s25 ultra do you have one do you want one let

replacing my rooting 60 H since I broke it but I don't want to spend another $170 or $140 for the module so I thought I tried this the Mad Lions mad 60 H and it costs just $45 the first thing you'll notice is that these look identical to each other the feet placement and the grooves on the top are the same it even has a strap so why does this cost just $45 but the wooting H cost over 170 I know why because I've been using this keyboard non-stop for around 2 weeks and at this price you'd think it would be absolute garbage and you'd be wrong or right you'll see what I mean later this is kind of hard to talk about I haven't used a product with such a massive price discrepancy from the product it's essentially copying and it is copying just look at this you can even swap the modules over between each case and they fit perfectly but there is a few differences first is the strap the wooting strap feels very heavyduty I would trust this with my life but the Mad 61 is like the cheap lanyard quality that you get when you go to some random event but this doesn't really matter anyway what does matter is the quality of the product and this is where it gets interesting the rooting 60 H is considered to be the best gaming keyboard you can buy for a load of different reasons which I'll touch on later but it's not without its flaws the switches have quite a bit of stem rattle so it doesn't sound great and it's a bare bones treay mounted keyboard which gives it a rather stiff feel when typing is further exposed by some of the incredible competition that has come out in the past year some of these competitors I've reviewed on this channel and they have made the wooting 60 H look a bit overpriced these days at least from a physical standpoint surely it's not going to be beaten by a $45 keyboard right so this is a treay mounted keyboard as well like the wooting 60 H you just remove five screws and this is it there there's a dampening foam pad on the bottom which is doing some very heavy lifting as you'll hear later and there's a sheet in between the PCB and top plate so it's not that different to the wooting setup but the quality of what's being used makes a bit of difference here the Foams are incredibly light this is almost reaching chocolate mous level texture and you can see it shifting around the cutouts because it's just so light and flexible there's very little density to this and we'll hear the impact of it in just a moment wooting is using poron foam in between the PCB and plate and EPDM foam for the bottom which is a really dense piece of synthetic rubber but let's do a sound check of the Mad 60 and the wooting 60 h on the Mad 60 you can really hear the slapping of plastic what I am impressed with is the stabilizers on cheaper keyboards these really do get exposed as there's often a lot of rattle or ticking but these sound okay they are lubed quite a bit which is probably a reason why and there's a little dampening pad on this Base Bar as well which will help reduce the rattle a bit obviously the sound of the keyboard is subjective but to me the $45 keyboard sounds better than the wooting which is ridiculous and this is probably down to the switches mainly on the wooting 60 H there's a lot of stem Ratt caused by the Le of switches but you're not buying a wooting 60 H because it sounds the best I've talked about this loads of times but you'll see what I mean in a bit you might wonder what switches the Mad 60 is using and I have no idea there's no branding on them the website says and I quote they are magnetic pro access Pro back cover Hi-Fi sound and the AliExpress page calls the magnetic per shaft Pro Hi-Fi sound on the back cover they are box stem switches which I believe helps with stability it certainly has a lot less stem wubble than the Leer switches there's also a cover on the bottom of the housing of the switch as well I did have doubts if these were actually hall effect switches and they are from the specs they provide it has a 3.5 mm total travel distance and strangely it's only adjustable in 0.08 mm increments all of the standard whole effect features like adjustable actuation and Rapid trigger including the additional sensitivities will work when I've been playing with this I've noticed no issues with any of these features and the Mad 60 has a few more surprises before we get to that the build quality of this product for the price that you're paying is just insane it really is it's not perfect but it costs $45 so who cares what's better is that you could do a few basic months to it and improve it further painters tape on the back of the PCB some better dampening foam as well on the bottom of the case you could even Lube the switches and these are rather cheap to do and because it's the same PCB layer as the 60 H you can even get yourself a better case or even buy the wooting optimum collab and use it with this but to do so you'd probably have to be absolutely mental the Mad 60 H gets even more surprising because this keyboard has the more advanced hall effect features like Dynamic keystroke mod tap toggle switch and even SD at the start these didn't work after a few times of updating the firmware these features then started to function and they seem to be rather stable whether or not they are accurate I don't know so really what's the catch here because at the moment it's looking like a cheaper wooting 60 H well there's several issues that may arise from buying this keyboard one is the warranty or after sales support from checking on the Mad Lines website there's a 30-day returns policy that's it and there's no information as to what happens outside of those 30 days if you buy it from AliExpress it might be different but there's no guarantees here there's been quite a few reports I've seen of people's keyboards bricking or malfunctioning after doing a firmware update or even just randomly after a week of use and a few cases of people being ghosted when trying to contact mad lions for help there have been firmer updates for this but you don't know if there's going to be any more in the future and having web-based software for a rather sketchy company means that if they disappear and the website gets taken down that's it you can't do anything with keyboard anymore because they are doing the bare minimum when it comes to software customer support and quality control they save a lot of money and can undercut everyone so it's going to be cheaper but you are taking a risk with this product and there's obviously morally questionable stuff going on here as well with mad lines copying the wooting 60 H and if you buy this keyboard you are encouraging it but I think with the current financial situation that a lot of people are facing these days and are possibly going to face when things get 20% more expensive for some people I do understand why somebody would look to buy this paying over $170 for a keyboard can be really hard to justify for someone with less Financial Freedom if you are on a budget then this keyboard is an option to go for just be aware of the risks that you are taking it's $45 and you're encouraging a very sketchy company so don't come crying to me if it breaks in a few months I mean what do you expect really alternatively if you save some money for a rooting 60 H you're getting a feature complete gaming keyboard that has a very generous warranty policy and is made by a trustworthy and Innovative company that has been vital in moving us away from the dog gaming keyboards we used to have if you don't want to 60 H there's a video on screen now giving you a choice of a couple of keyboards I recently reviewed,1,The video transcript primarily focuses on comparing two gaming

mid-range level chipset and a lower price so could it be the right choice for you I'm will for GSM Marina and let's find out in our full [Music] review for reasons we don't really understand Moto gives this flip phones different names depending on the market this phone is called the Moto Razer 2024 in North America and elsewhere is the Moto Razer 50 unlike last year is the Razer 40 which had a tiny cover screen this one has a fairly large display on the outside it's nearly edge to edge even going around the dual camera setup though it does stop about a centimet short of the hinge at the top this means the Razer 50 is closer to the ultra model than its predecessor it remains a more affordable alternative to the ultra the major difference being the far less powerful chipset like the ultra model the motor raser 50 is covered with vegan leather and in the orange color way we have here it looks quite snazzy of course half of the outside is taken up by the cover screen instead the frame of the phone is made of glossy 6000 series aluminum and the Razer 50 folds flat of course with no gap between the two halves it has a hinge made of stainless steel and when folded you end up with a square and quite compact device compared to last year there's better waterproofing like the ultra now the vanilla model is rated to ipx8 against water submersion let's talk a bit more about the hinge it allows the phone to be left open at any angle within a certain range useful if you want to prop it open on a table like a laptop a camcorder mode while shooting video was also made possible thanks to the mechanism's operation the cover screen is one of the biggest upgrades for the Razer in place of the tiny ticker style unit of last year now there's a higher res 3.6 in display with a 90 HZ refresh rate and Grilla glass victus protection you get nearly full functionality for your quick settings notifications and even full apps not all apps work natively though only those which are supported which will show up on the app page these include Gmail Google Maps and Google photos beyond that there are other apps which can work here as well but only in widget form Google Gemini is accessible right there on the cover display too for on the-go AI functionality another useful function of the cover screen is to use it as a viewfinder in order to snap selfies with the main cameras and it is much better this year with the larger screen space and in general switching between the screens is relative ly seamless while the phone is open you reveal the main display it's a 6.9 in foldable ltpo OLED with a 1080p resolution and a 120 HZ refresh rate it's decently flat considering its foldable nature though you can spot a bit of a crease when you go looking for it the display is sharp with a pixel density of 413 PPI and there's support for HDR 10 plus video playback there's no Dolby Vision support like you'd get on the ultra model though also the 120 HZ refresh rate falls short of the 165 HZ of the ultra still it's plenty to smooth out swiping on screen and thanks to the ltpo tech you can dial down to 1 Herz when idling to save energy the cover screen on the other hand only goes up to 90 HZ and it can dial down to 60 when you stop interacting with it the inner display is quite bright as well we only measured up to around 550 nits with a manual slider but this can boost in auto mode up to nearly 1,300 nits which is plenty for use outdoors in the sun we also measured up to around 1,300 nits in auto mode on the cover screen for audio the Razer has a pair of stereo speakers with very good loudness the sound is Lively though we will say that there isn't quite as much base here as there is on the ultra model I'm wide awake but you're nightmare I can't escape I'm seeing you everywhere PO for waking up and unlocking the phone there's a side mounted fingerprint reader built into the power button and it's quite reliable and the racer 50 can come with 256 or 512 gigs of storage on board which isn't expandable to micro SD like on other recent Moto phones the interface here is Motorola's new hello UI on top of Android 14 it's similar to stock Android but with some customizations added in these additional features are organized within the Moto app which has been restyled for hello UI here you'll find things like customization options and gestures there is support for advanced connectivity through Smart Connect which allows you to connect to a PC or an external Monitor and Moto promises 3 years of OS updates and 4 years of security patches here like I mentioned earlier this phone doesn't pack a flagship grade chipset like you'd find on most of flip devices instead you get a mid-range level mediatech dimensity 7300 a as expected benchmark scores were towards the bottom of the foldable pack way behind the Galaxy Z flip 6 and the Moto Razer 50 Ultra the results are more in line with something like the Moto Edge 50 Fusion still we wouldn't say the phone feels underpowered during regular use plus since the chipset isn't pushing too hard that means that the thermals are better here than on other foldables during our stress tests there was much less throttling than what we saw on the Z flip 6 for example the Razer 50 rer 2024 is powered by a 4200 mAh battery the same capacity as last year's model in our tests it earned an overall active use score of 11 hours and 46 minutes which is respectable for a flip foldable and in the video playback and web browsing tests this phone outclassed the competition one notable change compared to last year is that while there's again support for 33 w wired charging Moto doesn't include a charger in the Box this time around with a compatible adapter we were able to charge the phone from 0 to 59% in half an hour and a full charge took just over an hour there is support for 15 W wireless charging here too now we have the cameras unlike the ultra model you don't have a telephoto Zoom instead there's an ultra wide angle cam so overall on the back there's the same 50 megap main cam as the ultra plus a 13 megap Ultra wide cam which has autofocus daylight photos from the main camera are all right there is enough resolve detail but we're not fans of the processing there's excessive sharpening as well as jagged lines and artificial looking textures otherwise the dynamic range is nicely wide and the colors are vibrant yet not over the top and shots of people look relatively good with mostly accurate skin tones in outdoor settings there is a toggle in the viewfinder for two times digital Zoom the detail level isn't impressive but the shots are usable in low light the main camera produces like images with well balanced exposures highlights are well preserved and the shadow development is all right color saturation is good and the detail is generally good as well now for the ultrawide camera it photos have a decent amount of detail but the dynamic range is limited also it struggles with wide balance often producing results which are too cold or greenish at least since it has autofocus you can use the ultra wide to take macro close-ups with something you wouldn't be able to do with the Galaxy Z flip 6 for for example in low light the ultra wise photos come out gloomy and underexposed shadows are soft the detail remains okay in areas with more light selfies can be taken with the dedicated camera within the inner screen these are decent with good-looking colors and skin tones and all right detail however you'd probably prefer to take selfies using the rear cameras with the cover screen acting as a viewfinder these selfies from the main cam have better detail more saturated colors and even some natural bokeh the Razer 50 Ultra records video at up to 4K resolution at 30 FPS with all of its cameras the main camera's video quality is good for the class with plenty of detail even though it's not the most mature processing we've seen the footage is also quite contrasty the ultra wide 4K footage is pretty soft and the high contrast approach continues here too in low light the main camera's videos are quite noisy the dynamic range is fairly limited too electronic video stabilization does well to smooth out pans but there's still some shakiness left over while walking so that was the Moto racer 50 also known as the Moto racer 2024 like other top flip foldables this year's Razer packs a large cover screen with all sorts of functionality you also get better water resistance this year and good battery life the notable downsides here include the mid-range level chipset and the lack of a charger in the box also the camera quality quality isn't the best around just like the name the pricing of this phone varies depending on the market but if it happens to be cheaper than the competition where you live then you might take advantage of the deal if you're looking for Alternatives you can check out the Samsung Galaxy Z flip 6 or the Motorola Razer 50 Ultra if you don't mind spending a bit more cash let us know what you think and I'll see you on the next one",1,The video content focuses on a detailed review of the Motorola

Check out ...,GSMArena Official,2025-04-15T20:00:49Z,"{'default': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JAZrW-FArqU/default.jpg', 'width': 120, 'height': 90}, 'medium': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JAZrW-FArqU/mqdefault.jpg', 'width': 320, 'height': 180}, 'high': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JAZrW-FArqU/hqdefault.jpg', 'width': 480, 'height': 360}}",,JAZrW-FArqU,519,79025,en,JAZrW-FArqU,"[Music] here is a new mid-ranger from Motorola, the Edge60 Fusion. It may not be as high tier as other Moto Wedge models, but it still packs plenty of nice features. I'm Will for GSM Marina, and let's see what the Moto Edge 60 Fusion is all about in our full review. [Music] Historically, Motorola's Fusion phones have been the more budget friendly models of the Moto Edge lineup. The Edge 60 Fusion still has plenty to offer feature- wise, though. There's a higher res OLED display, advanced ingress protection, and a large battery with fast charging. And you even get expandable storage. Like the previous model, the Edge 60 Fusion has a thin and sleek design with a back covered in vegan leather that curves seamlessly into the camera housing. The back also curves into a thin plastic frame. Overall, the phone feels light in the hand and easy to wield. While last year's Fusion had IP68 rated protection against dust and water submersion, the new model is also rated at IP69, which means it can withstand heated water jets, too. The phone also complies with a military standard for use in extreme conditions and the display is protected by tougher Gorilla Glass 7i. The 6.67 in OLED display also has a higher 1220p resolution this time around. The screen refresh rate is 120 Hz and there's no difference from market to market like last year. The display looks great at an angle and swiping and scrolling feel perfectly smooth. The refresh rate is able to dial down to 60 Hz when the screen is idling to save energy. At 446 PPI, the display is sharper than last year's model. On top of that, there's now support for HDR10 plus video playback. There's plenty of brightness to be had here as well. We measured around 470 nits maximum with the manual slider, and this can boost to over 1370 nits in auto mode, plenty for comfy use outdoors. The Edge 60 Fusion has a stereo speaker setup for audio with excellent loudness. The sound quality is great, too, with deep and warm sound. We'll drop a link if you want to listen for yourself and compare to other phones. For biometrics, there's an optical underdis fingerprint reader. It's quite responsive, but we wish the placement was a bit higher up for comfort's sake. The Edge 60 Fusion has a higher base storage tier than last year, coming with 256 or 512 gigs of storage on board, and Motorola has brought back a feature that's not so easy to find these days. Expandable storage through micro SD. Plus, with an eSIM, you still get dual SIM support here. The interface of the Edge 60 Fusion is Moto's Hello UI on top of Android 15. It's similar to what we've seen on any recent Motorola phone. The experience is close to stock Android except for specific Moto features which you can find organized within the Moto Hub. One new feature you can find is smart tabs within the app drawer. These allow you to access a news feed or notes that you've recorded in the journal app. And you get the latest iteration of smart connect. Like before, it allows you to easily transfer files between devices and connect the phone wirelessly to a PC or monitor. But now you can also use voice commands to control the interface or search for files using natural language. Besides Google's Gemini AI, Motorola now also provides its own AI helper called Moto AI, which is brand new. You can access Moto AI on the fly by double tapping on the back of the phone. Or you can assign the double tap shortcut to something else, like launching a specific app or function. So why would you need Moto AI if there's already Gemini on board? Well, it can do things like summarizing and image generation that Gemini already can, plus exclusives like adding photos, screenshots, and text notes into the journal app. And for support, Motorola promises three major OS upgrades and four years of security patches for the Edge 60 Fusion. While the previous model had a Qualcomm chipset, the Edge60 Fusion uses a MediaTek one. It's either a Demenity 7300 in the globally available model we have here or a Demenity 7400 in select markets like India. When it comes to benchmarks, there are better performing phones in this price range. But the Edge 60 Fusion does a decent job earning scores which are slightly higher than last year. And when using the phone, it felt responsive and snappy most of the time. In our prolonged stress tests, the Edge60 Fusion did a decent job, but we did see occasional dips in the CPU performance due to throttling. Our Global Edge 60 Fusion has a 5200 mAh battery, and the model found in India has an even larger 5,500 mAh capacity. Our global unit did a very good job in our tests, earning an active use score of 14 hours and 18 minutes. The Edge 60 Fusion supports the same 68 watt charging as its predecessor, and in some markets, the charger is bundled with the phone. With such an adapter, the charging is speedy. We were able to charge the phone from 0 to 86% in half an hour, and a full charge took 44 minutes. There's no support for wireless charging here. Now, onto the cameras. You get two on the back. The main camera plus an ultrawide with autofocus. Basically the same setup as last year. The main camera's photos come out at 12.5 megapixels due to pixel binning. And during the day, the quality is quite good. There's a fair amount of detail and good sharpness. Colors are punchy and there's plenty of contrast. And here are some shots of people, too. The edge detection could be better implemented, but otherwise the photos look fine. We also prefer to take these photos at two time zoom, which made for much more appealing shots. Speaking of that, at two times digital zoom, the regular photos look good, too. But they have some extra blurriness, and we've seen better implementations. At night, the main camera tends to produce very good results. The photos are a bit oversharpened, but even outside of that, they're decently detailed with saturated colors. The phone goes for brighter looking exposures, which we like. During the day, the ultrawide camera produces great results. There's more detail than your usual ultrawide cam and sharpness is pretty good, too. The processing is overall similar to the main cam, albeit with a narrower dynamic range. Thanks to the autofocus, the ultra wide handles close-up macro shots pretty well, too. The nighttime photos from the ultrawide are quite all right. Colors are a bit conservative, and the color temperature is sometimes off, but other than that, you get good sharpness and dynamic range for this sort of camera. Selfies from the 32 megapixel front-facing cam come out at 8 megapixels, and they're rather good with impressive detail, accurate colors, and wide dynamic range. There is noticeable added sharpening, though, which can help imperfection stand out. The Edge 60 Fusion supports 4K video recording with all of its cameras, including the selfie cam. The main camera produces very nice videos. They're clean looking with natural colors and good sharpness and detail. The ultra wide camera's videos are some of the better we've seen in this class. However, the colors are a bit pale and there's some focus hunting. There's electronic video stabilization smoothing out the footage and it does a pretty good job. The main cam's low light video is pretty solid, especially for a phone in this price range. The footage is sharp with all right detail and no apparent noise. Highlights can come out of clip though. So, that's the Moto Edge 60 Fusion. It's got a lot going for it. There's a great display, loud, nice sounding speakers, very good battery life and fast charging, and a sleek, extra durable build. The cameras are pretty solid, and there's even expandable storage. Of course, it isn't perfect. You can certainly find other phones that have either a more powerful chipset or a zoom camera or even longer software support. But if you don't mind that, the Edge 60 Fusion has a really balanced feature set and a competitive price, and it's well worth recommending. Thanks for watching, guys.

360}}",,9Jotff7lEyk,696,210175,en,9Jotff7lEyk,"remember when I said that I loved using the xiaomi pad 6 with the software I like the xiaomi pad 6 more than the OnePlus pad well I also love using the new xiaomi pad 7 as well by the way the script is in front of me on this tablet itself now what I felt about the xiaomi pad 7 is that there are some very smart and useful upgrades that most of you guys will actually appreciate but you know what I'm getting ahead of myself I have a detailed review highlighting every single thing that I noticed after testing this device so stay tuned till the end all right if you're here for the first time I'm as you're watching track and Tech English your destion for detailed incisive Gadget reviews the first upgrade that you will notice is of course in the design of the pat 7 so it's basically still the same all aluminium build whether it's the frame or the back and the camera module also is very xiaomi 14 inspired including the fact that there is only a single camera inside that module which looks like it has three or four cameras but you know when you hold the pad 7 in your hand it feels a little more premium compared to the pat 6 I don't know what they've done with it but it feels like it has a little more polish also I really like the color that we're testing it's called Mirage purple but it doesn't look purple from any angle it looks like a very light blue like the Sierra blue color of the iPhone 13 Pro Max which is by the way one of my favorite iPhone colors so that on the pad 7 is damn nice another design change that shiai has done is a slight one where it has changed the aspect ratio of the display it's taller now so instead of 16 is to 10 it's 3 is to2 now so it's more squarish I'll talk more about the display in a bit the pat 7 is also perceptibly thinner compared to the pat 6 but it's a that bit heavier it's overall a nip and Tuck job that xiaomi has done with it and I feel like the design has evolved over the pad six to make it feel more premium and look more premium the type-c port at the bottom is the same USB gen 3 type-c Port but for somewhat reason xiaomi has gone ahead and nerfed it so with the pad 6 we had video out but with the pad 7 we don't which is a bit of a let down of the things that you should not expect with the pad are a Micro SD card slot there's no 4G 5G Sim support there should have been a variant with that slightly more they could have charged for it it would have been a nice option to have and of course you don't have a 3.5m headphone jack or a physical fingerprint scanner you still have to rely on your face to unlock the tablet now I'm going to be talking about the display next but before that if you haven't already hit that subscribe button so the 11.2 in display on the pad 7 is a square-ish resolution now like I mentioned and it's the same IPS LCD panel as well but the resolution has been up to 3.2k now along with 68 billion colors as well so the colors uh space has also increased including the fact that you get support for display P3 now plus you've got 144 HZ refresh rate with adap sync technology which switches between different refresh rates depending on the content that's playing on the screen and the screen can also reach a peak brightness of 800 nits in high brightness mode by the way the xiaomi pad 7 is also available with an anti-reflective anti-glare coating which is very important to talk about but the only thing is that our review on it didn't have it so we couldn't test it out but yeah it is the most expensive variant uh with that coating and that's definitely awesome primarily because only the iPad has it and now the xiaomi pad 7 also has it which which is pretty cool the tablet displays color tuning is actually done very well especially in that original Pro color mode what I noticed is that the Delta e is really low and if you're going to be using the tablet for Content creation and if you want it for specifically looking at colors and ensuring that the colors are accurate that the tablet does a pretty good job of it plus since this is a xiaomi pad there is of course going to be support for Dolby Vision on Netflix and the HDR tuning has been done exceptionally well so much so that sometimes I forgot that I was using an IPS LCD display it is very very good the black not as deep as OLED but this is one of the nicest IPS LCD panels that I've used in a long time the touch response is a very good 360 HZ and you also get something called Hydro touch which is essentially if you have wet hands or wet fingers then even then you can operate the display one interesting certification that I noticed was duv rinin flicker-free certification which indicates that this could have a very high pwm dimming rating but unfortunately I don't have the numbers but yeah the flicker seems to be low and of course you get quad speakers with Dolby Atmos support so you get a really spatial sound and it sounds good but I felt like there could have been a little bit more depth and a little bit more base but anyway listen to it for yourself and let me know what you guys [Music] think by the way you can connect twws buds that support highis CeX like LC and LTC and this pad will play it without any issue now performance is where xiaomi has made a huge jump it's like double the performance compared to the previous pad 6 now what you get now is a Snapdragon 7 plus gen 3 and we are all aware that it's a fantastic performer apart from that you also have two variants you got the 8 128 GB and the 12 256 GB the 128 GB variant has ufs 3.1 storage whereas the 256 GB variant as ufs 4.0 and you get lpddr 5x Ram type as well so the performance and benchmarks is fantastic we got an Anto score of over 1.4 million the gig bench score is also in line with what we achieved with Snapdragon 7 plus gen 3 PHS in the past and the CPU stability score in our 40 thre 30 minute run was 91% which is fantastic but most importantly this Android tablet is going to be an affordable gaming Beast trust me so I played genion impact on this at highest Graphics at 60 frames per second and I got an average of 59 frames per second which is better than any Snapdragon 7 plus gen 3 phone that I've tested till date that's not it bgmi runs at Extreme Plus graphics and grid Legends also runs on this tablet there are phones that I have right now with the demens 9400 which cannot run grid Legends and this one can which is awesome now while the performance is good I expected the battery life to be slightly better so I'm barely touching about 7 hours of screen on time it should have been at least 7 to 8 hours of screen on time because it's got a 8,850 m battery but I believe that if there was a 10,000 MH battery then we could have gotten better battery life but the charging speeds with the upgraded 45 W charger that you get inside the box is very good this massive battery took only about 1 hour you know 40 odd minutes for a full charge which is not too bad at all by the way remember how I said that the pad 6 didn't have the compass sensor the pad 7 doesn't make any such compromises all the sensors that you need are available there is a compass sensor as well so if you're somebody who likes to use a tablet for Google Maps when you're driving around then the the pat 7 would be the right one for you now there are two cameras on the tablet one on the rear 13 MP and one on the front 8 MP see you shouldn't be expecting these cameras to be like wow because they're just there so that you can capture some photos of documents and to make some video calls right if you're using Google meet and in that scenario I like that the front camera has a very wide angle so a lot of you including what is there in the background can be filled in the video talking about videos you get 1080p 30 FPS video recording option from the front from the rear camera you can shoot 4K 30 FPS videos but you can also shoot 108p 60 FPS videos I mean but don't go around holding a camera and shooting videos with it it just looks very bad now let me tell you about the new accessories there are two new accessories both are attached to the tablet right now so you get this Focus keyboard and focus pen so the focus keyboard is Apple Smart Keyboard look alike and it sort of mimics what the Apple Smart Keyboard does but I really like the keyboard on this one you get excellent key travel with nice and clicky keys in fact I wrote the entire script on this keyboard and my typing speed didn't reduce at all it is actually very good plus the Keys have back lighting so if you're using it in the night that shouldn't be a problem either so this is a very well done keyboard setup if you ask me the trackpad has gesture support which is kind of nice but it's kind of tiny for my big hands and I felt like there was very little surface area for me to work around with and I was tapping on the outside of the trackpad or sometimes on the keys unintentionally also the click on the trackpad feels a little unrefined so whenever I was pressing it I felt like I might break the trackpad I felt the same thing with the backspace key on the keyboard for some odd reason as well uh you can hear it like it sounds kind of I don't know yeah yeah it sounds a little odd I do like the magnetic attachment on the pad itself so basically it's very easy to like sort of remove it and attach it and it's latches on very strongly as well but I don't know for sure if these new accessories will work with the pad 6 though by the way this keyboard has a tilt angle of 0 to 124° I feel like 124° is kind of low it should have been slightly high to say about 140° because nobody's going to use it under 90° right I mean nobody's going to use it like this like who wants to use it at 0 degrees so yeah I think that it should have been slightly higher now the focus pen has uh you know 81 92 levels of pressure sensitivity and you've got two buttons with three functions and when you're using the pen you get 240 HZ of touch sampling rate on the display itself it's a nice stylist but not as natural feeling as the more expensive ones that I've used it doesn't have that pen to paper feel that you know we all crave for that's not there it legit felt like I was touching the stylus on glass now between the two accessories I would say that you can skip out on the focus pen but this Focus keyboard I feel like it's a must-have accessory now one thing I'm really glad about is the fact that the pad 7 comes with hypos 2.0 based on Android 15 and xiaomi didn't make the same blunder that it did with the redmi note 14 series which we all know has hyper 1.0 based on Android 14 anyway hyper 2.0 for tablets is awesome it's really good it turns the pad 7 into a workhouse tablet so you can actually use it for work like I replaced it with my laptop and I didn't feel too much of an issue with it let me break down some of the features for you firstly what you get are these gorgeous lock screen wallpapers and clock styles that kind of look fetching you also get a persistent dock that you can invoke within any app so which is nice now for multitasking you can have two apps in split screen and you can have two more additional floating windows and the performance of the tablet is so good that it doesn't break a sweat and to put an app in floating mode is also easy there are multiple ways to do it you can just drag and drop it from the dock or you can just long press it and put it in loading mode so there are a lot of options there's also a new workstation mode which turns your tablet into a desktop like uh you know scenario where you can have multiple windows at the same time and you can use it like you know like you would use a PC and that to me is like a GameChanger honestly for AI you now get Gemini integration but there are a few others like AI writing life subtitles and xiaomi creation which is like the image playground version of xiaomi all of that is coming a little later in an OD update but with the gallery app I noticed that you get AI eraser and AI Sky replacement which can come in handy and talking about coming in handy uh they will generally come in handy when you connect your xiaomi phone with the interconnectivity features to this tablet because interconnectivity on hyper OS 2.0 is the bomb you can use NFC to tap on the tablet itself to share images or to mirror your phone screen on the tablet now once mirrored you can even drag and drop the content you can also use your Mobile 5G and create an instant hotspot and even the calls get synced what I noticed is that in my testing it all works very seamlessly in fact if you want like a detailed breakdown of how interconnectivity works I link a very good video by Texar Sr go go check that out so hyper 2.0 is a killer experience on the pad 7 now after using and reviewing the pad 7 the one constant thought that kept popping up in my head was that there are two xiaomi right now in 2025 the one xiaomi that makes excellent products like the P 7 itself and the other xiaomi that sells the redm notee 14 series now this dichotomy has been slight confused and I hope xiaomi can fix that as soon as possible because I genuinely legit feel like xiaomi is one of the brands that can make great products and the pad 7 is one good example of it but that's also a longer conversation for another day now if you ask me about the pad 7 itself it's an easy recommendation just go ahead and buy it it's one of the best Android tablets that you can buy all right so that's it for me I'll see you guys in the next one until then keep tracking and stay safe [Music]",1,The video is a detailed review of the Xiaomi Pad 7

pretty significant price increase over the se3 by $170 which means that there's now only a $200 price difference between the iPhone 16e and the iPhone 16 so what sort of extras do you get if you go for the iPhone 16 well I'm going to be comparing everything from the design their displays camera performance battery and features to help you guys decide but before that ESR actually sent us some cases and accessories that perfectly match with the new iPhone 16e or an ESR later in the video okay so let me just start off with the design as there are quite a lot of differences here the 16e despite having 16 in its name actually recycles the body of the iPhone 14 so if I compare the frames you'll see that a 16 has a more rounded frame towards the edges whereas the 16e is way more sharp they both feature a frosted glass back which I do really like but the iPhone 16 comes in five colors three of which are Super vibrant as opposed to just two black and white on the iPhone 16e there's also a pretty big difference when we take a look at the camera modules with the iPhone 16e only having a single module as opposed to two more on their performance later another big difference is when we take a look at the front where the 16e still has the old Notch whereas with a 16 we do get the dynamic Island all in all I don't dislike the design of the 16e but I cannot argue with the fact fact that a 16 just looks way more modern which brings me to their displays and here they both have a 6.1 in panel and like I said the 16 comes with a dynamic Island as opposed to the notch so viewing content is just a bit more enjoyable on the 16 as you do get less distractions plus I do also quite like having the dynamic Island foreseeing my alarms or tracking my Uber from there aside from this the 16e also seems to have ever so slightly thicker bezels than the 16 but really the biggest display difference between the two is the brightness so on paper the 16 can only go up to 800 nits Outdoors as opposed to 2,000 nits on the iPhone 16 now you do need to be in a fairly bright sunny environment for this to happen but if you are then the 16 will be able to boost much higher which brings me to the camera where we do actually get a lot of differences the biggest one is of course the lack of an ultra module on the iPhone 16e which I think is a really bad choice from Apple like I've get why they've done it but literally any Android phone at this price range has at least two camera modules if not even three so the fact that we only get one on the 16e just isn't great and even when it comes to that single camera module even though it is 48 megapixels in resolution so same as the iPhone 16 it is not the same sensor as on the iPhone 16 in fact it is a smaller sensor although one design for the iPhone 16e specifically according to what Apple told me at their press briefing taking a look at some samples they actually look very similar in terms of the image processing pretty much identical strangely enough once we zoom in the 16e is the one that's sharper although it looks to be simply an image processing Choice here same thing in this sample where the 16e once again seems to have more sharpness if we zoom in although it also has more noise if you take a look at the top of the bridge we can also see more noise in this shot right here and on top of that we also get less depth of field on the 16 e shot due to this being a smaller sensor if we take a look at some night samples the 16 is quite a bit clear same thing here in this lower light chart where the larger sensor on the iPhone 16 does make a substantial difference when it comes to the overall detail that we get luckily the front- facing camera is literally the same so no difference here at all now if we take a look at the video performance it is pretty much identical to the iPhone 16 aside from one big difference and that is when you have a lot of motion when you're walking or running the iPhone 16e is going to be less stable than the iPhone 16 since its sensor is just not stabilized like the iPhone 16s is now on top of not having an ultra module and the main module being inferior we do also miss out on a bunch of a camera features too for example there's no support for macro at all which is something that that Ultra module gives us there's also no support for spatial video something that we also do need that Ultra module 4 and surprisingly there's also no action mode or cinematic mode which I'm assuming is because of only having one single module as well and for some reason we are also lacking the more advanced photographic styles that the iPhone 16 has even though this seems to be a purely software feature so while the camera is fine for $600 Apple could have at least given it the same sensor as the iPhone 16 rather than a downgraded one okay now earlier I mentioned esrs accessories for the new iPhone 16e and right here is esrs rugged Halo loock cyber tough case which offers up to a 23 ft drop protection to test it we're going to drop it three times and hopefully it doesn't break our only unit and look at that it survived this is thanks to their Innovative layer design which uses a variety of material and Linings to withstand impacts an ESR is Max if compatible Halo lock inside is twice as strong as their competitors ensuring that your accessories are always secure even if I try to shake it with my full force then the Halo classic hybrid case is bit more minimal and comes with a clear scratch resistant back blade that exceeds military grade and lastly to protect your display hassle-free simply place your phone on esrs Ultra fit armorite screen protector tray and then pull the tab it's pretty d too I tried to scratch it with my keys and there wasn't even a mark check out ESR iPhone 16e accessory lineup by using the links below and this brings me to the performance on paper the iPhone 16e comes with the same a18 chip and 8 GB of RAM as the iPhone 16 but in fact the 16e a18 chip comes with one less GPU core four instead of five so if we test how the CPU performance you'll see that in the single core it is pretty much the same as the 16 in multi-core the 16 e surprisingly scores 100 points higher not really sure why this is the case however if we do a GPU test you'll see that the iPhone 16 scores 16% higher thanks to that additional GPU core so there is a pretty notable difference here will this impact the gaming performance well it's a bit hard to say but Apple did tell me that all major AAA titles like Assassin's Creed Mirage should still run and feel just like they do on the iPhone 16 and I can confirm that AC Mirage does indeed run very well here but when it comes to the batteries this is where things get really strange because the iPhone 16e actually comes with a larger battery than the iPhone 16 which is said to be around 3,900 mahes compared to 3500 and thanks to that and also Apple's brand new C1 5G modem that's inside we actually get four extra hours of video playback on the 16e for a total of 26 compared to 22 in fact the 16e has a very similar battery life to the iPhone 16 plus despite its much smaller size this is really really impressive sure the larger battery does play a part in this too but the real difference is made by that C1 modem which is the most efficient modem ever used in an iPhone I don't know if you guys remember but back in 2019 Apple bought Intel's 5G modem division for $1 billion and 6 years later and probably billions more in R&D costs and we got the C1 modem which is likely just the start of some fairly major battery life gains in future Apple products as well and I'm really glad to see apple include a C1 in the 16e and focus on battery life on their entry level iPhone something that they've literally never done before but on the other hand Apple decided not to give the 16e Mac Save which is really in my opinion the biggest deal breaker of this phone I mean sure you can buy a case with a Max ring built in like from our sponsor ESR but wireless charging will still be locked to 7.5 Watts as opposed to 15 watts on the iPhone 16 Apple's 16 e cases did not feature Max sa at all so I think it's pretty clear to me that if you're looking for Max sa specifically Apple wants to push you towards the iPhone 16 instead and by the way if you're wondering where both of their wallpapers are from they're free to download from our app wallpapers and in an 8K quality as well so what about features is there anything else that the 16e misses out on well surprisingly it does have the action button something that I was not expecting to see here and unlike the iPhone 16 you can also configure it to trigger Apple visual intelligence the 16 does this through the camera control button which in addition to the action button also lets you quickly launch the camera and then also adjust some camera settings by have pressing it although personally I actually disabled this from my iPhone 16 Pro Max as I ended up accidentally messing up some of my settings when I was just holding the phone in portrait mode so yeah I don't think that is a huge loss for the 168 we also get the exact same Apple intelligence features on the 16e as on the 16 so things such as writing tools Emoji or Cleanup in photos that's all there although for me the most useful Apple intelligence feature has definitely been notifications summaries which we do get on both here as for the speakers here's a quick speaker [Music] test to me they sound the same now there are also some connectivity aspects that have been downgraded on the iPhone 16e such as only having Wi-Fi 6 as opposed to Wi-Fi 7 which I guess is fine for most people but what I think is not fine is the fact that you're also lacking that Ultra wideband chip so if you happen to have an air tag you're not going to get that accurate Precision finding feature instead you'll only be relying on Bluetooth which is just not that great so okay having said all of this it is pretty clear that the iPhone 16e does actually lack quite a lot compared to the iPhone 16 and honestly I do think that the main reason why the iPhone 16e even exists is to actually push more people towards the iPhone 16 at the end of the day I still think that getting a refurbished iPhone 15 Pro is by far the best choice as you can get it for around $600 and with that you get a triin camera module a 120 HZ display that is so much brighter as well and you still get all the Apple intelligence features with it so really that is your best bet but if you don't want to buy a refurbished iPhone then I would still go with the 16 over the 16e but yeah let me know your thoughts as well and also stay tuned for more iPhone 16e content and comparisons I'm Daniel soon Tech and I'll see you guys in the next one Z Tech signing out cheers [Music]",1,The video transcript focuses on a comparison between the iPhone 16e and iPhone 16

chichu certified products that are hidden in the market here are my top five number five goes to the Inu bb7 magnetic power bank now I'm not quite sure I trust this brand Inu just yet but this bi7 did beat out this anchor 622 which is one of the better products from last year and it beat it out for one reason I'll get into it now this mag saave compatible power bank has a 6,000 milliamp hour capacity sizewise it's no bigger than a deck of cards but the back has the soft rubber coating that's really prone to fingerprinting there's a kickstand built into the power bank allows your iPhone to do this as well as this now the mag strength for this product isn't that great because it takes about 9.2 Newtons to remove the power bank from the iPhone average is 9.5 Newton so it's not terrible still strong enough for you to pick your iPhone up this power bank has rounded edges so it gives your hands just a little bit more to grab on to now from a charging perspective for this product this little battery pack was quite fast for a ch1 charger giving my iPhone an average charge of about 27% in 30 minutes which is pretty high because the average Maxi compatible charger in my collection is 20% but when doing a flow through charge which is having this battery pack as zero charging into the iPhone while plugged in the charge rates were way below average at 12% in 30 minutes this battery pack ran a tad cooler at 104° F versus the average of 105 and for its total capacity it's 6K on paper but based on my calculation it took about 6.4k to fill out the power bank now here's the one thing that puts this charger above the mag go 622 is the price this thing is $ freaking so for something that runs a bit cooler is decently sized and charges decently it's a steal of a deal this is number five this thing is number four actually this thing is number four this is the autobbox mul mount power bank with mag safe now this product last year was number one this year it's number four mostly because there's a new charging standard and this one is still a cheap one though it is made for mag now this power bank is pretty expensive it's $140 but don't be put off by the price because I don't think there's a lot of price gouging going on here now the state of battery capacity is 3.5k the OtterBox says it's at 7.4 WTS so if we were to compare apples to apples with everything else this is a 7K battery pack now from a charge speed perspective this product gave me a charge of 20 7% in 30 minutes which is decent in a flowr charging test it was a bit slower giving me about 21% another neat feature about this product is it's got that like click same click you would find on the uh old school Apple mag safe charger I really wish Apple would update this now one of the downsides of this product is the size it's pretty bulky like it's an odd shape for your hands now what sets this product apart are the extras you get a desk Mount and you also get a vent mount the desk Mount can pivot so you can pick the viewing angle of your iPhone and the vent mount is a clamp Style with a sticky bit in the middle now for me the price is worth it for this product because your iPhone will never be out of power let me explain because when your iPhone is always in this setup this battery bank is always charged half the time when I use a MAG safe battery bank I forget to recharge it so by the time I need to use it well it's dead and then I would theoretically have to wait 2 to 3 hours for it to charge but that's not going to happen with this product because it's always going to be charged you're not using the stand without the battery part so if you're always on the go this is going to be a great product for you when it comes to reviewing max8 battery Banks I score everything based on 12 criteria ranging from Stand p on charge test to flow through charge tests the strength of the magnetic connection differences in stated and measured capacity temperature as well as any other extras did I miss anything Monty now I do all this because I'm a reviewer not influencer so if you're finding my content useful support me by getting your stuff through my links no manufacturers paying me to make this video I just I just want to know what the best tech is so this is number four this thing is number three it's the anchor Mago 6.6k power bank this is a T2 product I don't know where it is in this pile of charging Banks oh there it is this thing charges like a banshee in fact every 22 Battery Bank I've tested is bloody fast so much faster than uh normal g1's but how do the speeds compare to just normal mag safe well I'll let you know in a couple minutes this product is a little different because you can actually use it as a stand Su specs for this product says that it is a dual celled battery Bank they're wired in series so I guess there's one battery over here another R battery down here the capacity of this charge pack is 6600 So based on that's probably going to give your iPhone three full charges now my 30-minute charge test this thing gave my iPhone a charge of 41% which is pretty great because the same test with an apple Max sa charger it's 33% now what's even crazier with these uh ch2 products is the flowr charger with this product I got an average of 48% in 30 minutes like that is insane to me but also worrying because it does run hot at 110° fit with the average being only 105 now one of the benefits of these newer power Banks is how fast they charge this thing has an inputs of 20 wats with these newer power Banks you can get a full charge 6.6k in about 2.25 hours now before you go and smash the uh byy link for this products know that it's 70 bucks considering that my number five pick the Nu is only 20 do you think an extra $50 is worth being able to charge things 33% faster all the time now there are two things that bother me up with this product first thing is the bottom of the product because it is a stand and so it will scratch quite easily and the second thing that annoys me is the magnetic strength it is a bulkier power bank so it only has a magnetic strength connection of 9.5 Newtons which is average but I feel like it should be more because this thing is very very bulk so this is number three this thing is number two it's the Balon boost charge Pro magnetic power bank 5 I'll be honest with you this was surprising to me because nothing from Balon has made it into my top five top 10 list in like 5 years 6 years most of the time I think you're just buying it for the brand name now the first thing I noticed about this power bank is the size it is very very tiny it's almost as small as the Apple mag safe power bank this thing has a small but functional stand from a charge spe perspective I only got 32% in 30 minutes which is average for a T2 charger but also ran very hot at 110° F when I do slice up all the data with her temperature 109 110 is actually the average for2 but for all the Chargers together the average is only 105 G1 runs a lot cooler which makes sense because it's a slower charging rate but when it came to flow through charging this thing was screaming I got 46% in 30 minutes which again is very crazy to see for a wireless charger seriously when it comes to flow through charging with these new T2 Chargers the uh speeds are about 50% faster than the old ones charging these T2 products from dead is also much faster except for the balcon I'll get into it the magnetic strength of this product was about 1.5 Newtons above average so you really don't have to worry about both the battery pack falling off your iPhone or your iPhone falling from the battery pack now this product does have a glaring downside from my perspective it doesn't charge at 20 WS or more accurately it does say something about 20 wats but it's a funny 20 wats when I was charging this thing from De it took on average 3 hours to fully charge which is a really long time on my meters I was seeing this battery me consuming only 12 Watts for my Chargers which is brutal but when I was doing flowthrough charging I was seeing 20 so something's a little funny with belza product but at the end of the day this is only 60 bucks which is one of the cheaper better priced T2 mag Safe products that I've test it I'm pretty excited to put this into my rotation this guy was number two number one goes to this thing this the anchor Mago 10K it's also this certified seriously guys I'm not sponsored by anchor but they make damn good charging gear so this 10K battery Bank like the 6.6k that came in number three has two 5K cells in series The sell in series feature seems to be more common to a newer power Banks and based on my research that feature means there's better heat management there's less voltage loss than one cell regardless like the 6.6k this thing is bloody fast what's neat is the size this is the 6.6k this is the 10K volume wise they are about the same I guess the hinge design takes up a lot of space this 10K power bank also has a stand feature the finish on the product also makes it look very greasy when it came to charge speeds I got 42% in my 30-minute charge test 49% in my flowr testing but the crazy thing is when it came to temperature this one was only 104° F which is cooler than average now the cherry on top of this charging sunde is a little status screen that anchor includes it'll tell you what's left in the pack as well as how long it will take to charge as well as discharge now this isn't critical information as you can kind of get the same amount of information as the average pack that uses you know four dots but it is a feature that adds to the quality of life of this product now the only gripe I have with this product is the magnetic strength it is not great I tested it at about 9.4 Newtons the average is 9.5 Newtons so not a big deal breaker but I do think it should be stronger given that it is a bigger battery bank so that's all I got for this video questions comments leave them down there if there's a product that you think I'm missing well let me know did I forget anything Monty oh right I'm a REV and out influencer so if you're going to get your stuff use my links I just want to figure out what the best product is thanks for watching",1,"The video and its transcript focus on reviewing and ranking MagSafe battery packs for the iPhone 16, providing

So in terms of storage and RAM there is no compromise uh or anything. Uh the general problem that we have with compact flagship smartphones is that uh the battery life is generally mediocre on them and also even with regular usage because of the compact size etc. they generally have a little bit of heating issues. I'm happy to say that the Xiaomi 15 solves uh those issues and also the camera performance is very good. So overall it's actually a very very uh good smartphone but again the devil is in the details. If you want to know all the details, stay tuned. So, let's dive into the pros and cons of this uh smartphone. And regarding the pricing, guys, uh it's available in Amazon. So, I'll leave the link. And I just checked before making this video. Uh it's being sold for 65,000. But again, still there is that 5,000 off if you use credit card. So, it comes at around 60,000. So, let's uh dive to the pros and cons of this one. And the first thing that I liked about this smartphone is the compact screen. And again, you will be buying this smartphone because you simply hated the bigger smartphones. This actually fits easily in your hand. In fact, I would say in terms of screen size, this is very similar to the compact iPhone. This is the iPhone 16 Pro. And if you notice, it's almost very very similar. In fact, this is slightly taller, I would say. But again, these are like the new compact smartphones uh in the industry. And easily fits in a single hand like this if you're using it. So that way I would say I like it. It's a single hand device. And again, it's very very powerful. Comes with that Snapdragon 8 Elite processors. That's the best that you can get on Android as of now. And again, the screen quality is good. I would say uh it's not too small, not too big. Uh so I like it. And even in outdoor sun, I would have to say the screen is easily visible. Is it the best screen in outdoor situation? No. That award I would still give to the S25 Ultra because of that anti-glare or whatever it has. Uh it's the best outdoor uh inside. But again this is no slouch I have to say the screen is uh bright enough and again uh you have that punch and colors and also this is a LTPO screen so it can move that one herz to that 120 Hz. In fact all my testing I did it on 120 Hz. I forced it to 120 Hz. So whatever you see it was done at 120 Hz. Now coming to the physical aspects of this phone I like that this is made up of actually metal. Uh they say it's some sort of aluminium or whatever. And again the back is also uh glass and I like that it's that matte side uh kind of a glass. So again it simply does not attract any fingerprints. So uh it's actually looks very very nice I would say. I've been using it without the case and as you can see no nicks or anything though this phone has been accidentally dropped in. I'll show you in the bottom there. As you can see there is a slight dent. Um maybe I'll zoom in uh and show you a picture graph. And here as you can see and a little bit of the paint had chipped off but again this was a massive drop and when it fell I'd say the phone is gone but nice to see that uh it did survive that and again but again as it's aluminium I got a slight dent towards it but that talks about the durability of the phone so uh the durability is there again in terms of glass Xiaomi just like what do you say the iPhones the iPhone call this whatever that ceramic glass or whatever uh this is the Xiaomi's what is that fancy word they call it? Uh Xiaomi's own uh shield glass or whatever. So again, yes, it did survive that drop, that nasty drop and didn't crack. So I have to say in terms of durability, it's a good thing. But again, don't be a fool like me if you're using it. Uh this one use the case that comes inside the box. This is the case that actually comes inside the box. So will give you uh actually pretty good protection. And in fact, even with the case, the smartphone does not look that bad. So this is how it actually looks. And also uh in terms of bezels and everything, I have to say the bezels are pretty thin. This is the iPhone 16 Pro and as you can see the bezels are actually pretty thin even on the Xiaomi 16. So I don't know there is a big obsession between some people about the bezels and all the things. The bezels are pretty pretty thin and I'm happy with the screen quality on this one also. No so no issues uh regarding that I have to say. Also, I like the fact that this is now coming with the ultrasonic fingerprint scanner. And as you can see, it's very very accurate. And even if you press it slightly, if you don't aim it on here, even on the side, it unlocks very very quickly. So that way, no issues whatsoever with the fingerprint scanners. So in terms of specs, I have to say they have done a very good job. In fact, here are all the specs. And if you look at the specs, they have thrown in everything that you expect on a flagship Android uh smartphone. And yes, this also does get the IR blaster. Uh it's over here somewhere in the middle and I did test the IR blaster uh with the Mi remote with my Dykin AC and item book fan. Now let's talk about the uh OS that is used. Again, it's Android 15 but this is having the skin which is actually very familiar to iOS. I would say the Xiaomi's own. In fact, if I do this down as you can see it's inspired I would say from iOS I have to say. So here and if you do this you get to your notifications and stuff. So this is a Hyper OS uh version two that you're getting. If I go to about the device and about the phone as you can see this is Xiaomi Hyper OS version 2 which is nothing but Android 15. And this smartphone is supposed to get the next four Android upgrades. I wish it was five but yeah that's what it is. But again as this is Hyper OS this is a skin. Uh so oh it is a little bit different I would say but left if you go uh you have your Google pane that is similar and you can uh do this and access your app trace and it divides in like this. So this is very familiar but again as it's a what do you say still a Xiaomi smartphone there are quite a bit of Xiaomi apps that are pre-installed like themes get apps uh this mi home and also some of the system apps that uh we have in fact I like some of the apps that are the recorder and all those things because they do have a little bit of AI integration and all those things but again you still have that themes app and the gets app which I am not a big fan of but this is what it is and again because of the processor that is used the Snapdragon 8 Elite with the the fast storage. Again, the UFS4 is the storage that you're getting. That is one of the fastest that you're getting on this one. Again, everything loads very very well. And because of that RAM also, that's 12 GB of RAM that this one has. Also, the RAM management has been good on this smartphone. I did not have to actually boot out apps etc. You can just tap in and as you can see, these are some of the apps that I had open earlier. They stay in actually memory. So, the memory management was also very well done on this one. So that way uh apart from those some of the extra Xiaomi apps in general day-to-day operations I did not have an issue with this uh smartphone. Now coming to the call quality on this one uh I have been actually using this one with only a single SIM that is my AEL main my main SIM is AEL. So I've been using with this one for the last 3 weeks and I did even do travel. I went to Mumbai for a day and stuff like that. And in terms of network and the call quality I did not have any issues. The earpiece is loud and clear. There is no what do you say um proximity sensor or anything. The voice are also very very clear. So in that area I would say Xiaomi has actually done a very good job. In fact I would say the signal reception on this one is also particularly pretty good on this uh smartphone. Again the speaker phone is also loud and clear. Uh it does have that stereo speakers. Uh and I have to say the stereo speakers are good for a compact smartphone and they get pretty loud. But if I have to compare the stereo speakers with the iPhone 16 Pro, then I have to say at max volume, the iPhone 16 Pro's uh speakers have a little bit more depth and that wide effect. I would say at max volume, this can crack a little bit. Uh that is what I have noticed. But apart again, this is nitpicking that I'm doing. Uh but overall, uh good stereo speakers. But again if I have to compare with the iPhone 16 Pro this gets slightly better speakers at the maximum volume. One thing I was a little bit worried is that generally many of the compact smartphones because of the size these are actually using those flagship chips but again physically the size is small. So generally in thermals they get a little bit hot. In fact that was the problem with the Xiaomi 14. But I'm happy to say with regular day-to-day usage, the Xiaomi 15 does not get hot at all. They get just slightly warm, but not hot. In fact, I have to say the iPhone 16 Pro in similar usage, regular usage does tend to get a lot warmer to touch compared to the Xiaomi 15. So, in terms of thermals, I would say this is a huge upgrade what they have done compared to the Xiaomi 14. Now coming to the battery on this one. Uh this actually has a strange 5,240 miamp battery and u I'm uh overall I have to say the battery life is very good but I'm saddening to say that in the MIUI if you go to the battery stats the battery stats are rubbish because it simply as you can see I've took it out from the charger 26 hours 29 minutes but again no way it actually gives you the actual screen on time. So, I've installed this third party app that is called Aqu battery and I have to say the battery life is actually very good in terms of screen on time. Anywhere from 7 hours to almost close to 10 hours you can easily get. As you can see, this is the last uh usage. It's been off the charger for 26 hours, 30 minutes or whatever. And still we have 31% battery life left. We have used it for 5 hours, 41 minutes. So, easily will last me for about 7 odd hours. And uh according to this uh AU battery if you continuously use the phone the screen will last for about 13 odd hours. So realistically I would say the battery life is very good because when I was in Mumbai for about one uh over a day this was completely only on mobile data and then also I got actually pretty good battery life. So in terms of battery life, I have to say this is one of those rare compact flagships that will not annoy you or you have to run for the charger in the evening or something like that. Easily easily I would say it'll last for a full typical day. In fact, for most uh situations if you're just using a single SIM, it'll last you for easily for about 1 and 1/2 days. Uh now coming to the charging, uh we do get this 90 watt charger in the box. So I appreciate that Xiaomi is giving this charger. Uh but the thing is that if you really want to charge it at that full speed then the smartphone actually gets pretty hot to touch and by default uh the setting is not set to charge at full speed. So, as you can see from this option, the wired charging option is actually set to standard. But if you want the full speed charging, you have to set it to top speed. But I will not recommend you to always use a stop speed because when I tested it charging at the top speed, the handset actually if you touch it becomes very very hot. So I would suggest just leave it to the standard and even the standard option it is fairly fast. But again, if you really want that full speed, you have to keep it on top speed. So in this aspect I would say the OnePlus uh that rock charging or whatever they call does a far better job. Uh those devices actually do not get heated up even at the fastest charging. That is something that I have noticed and again you will obviously buy this smartphone because it's a compact smartphone and you also take a lot of photographs and you want that quality and here I have to say this smartphone does not disappoint. Again this is also a Leica branded camera. So they have worked with Leica for the cameras and has a triple camera setup. All the three cameras are actually 50 MP. The ultra wide, the main that is 23 mm and the telephoto is a weird 2.8 uh X that is 60 mm on this one. And the front facing oops spam and yeah the true color and all those things actually work well uh without any issues. Again as I was talking about RAM management works brilliantly on uh this uh smartphone. Uh so let me actually now show you the camera samples that I've taken with this smartphone. Let's start with some outdoor shot. This is regular mode. This is that zoom 60 mm and this was finally ultra wide. One more example. This was taken with the main lens at night and this was ultra wide. Ultra wide at night. The picture is a little bit soft. One more example. Again this was with the main lens. picture came out very good. This is ultra wide. If you notice around the corners, it's a little bit soft. Again, taken with the main lens. And again, as you can see, the main lens is very good and you get some very good shot. The zoom lens also takes very good shots and there's no artificial sharpening. So, looks close to a DSLR shot. Some more random samples taken with the main lens that's 23 mm. You also get that natural background blur that is depth of field because the of the f1.6 aperture very easily. Now for some pictures taken in night condition in various lighting conditions so that you can judge the camera performance and overall I would say the camera performs well even in artificial lighting. Uh this was the zoom shots and zoom shots also actually come out good. This gives you an example. This was default at 23 mm. Here I zoomed to 120 mm and my wife was ordering something. I wanted to see what was in the menu. Zoomed to 14 uh 16 mm and this is what we got. Now some pictures of human subjects and this was in the po black and white mode that we have. Uh some more examples to give you an idea how it deals with skin tones. And in good lighting it produces very good shots. And this was a very dull lighting conditions. And here I took the picture. In regular mode it was good. But when we invoke the portrait mode I noticed there is softness in the picture in low lighting. Now for some selfies with the front-facing camera. And as you can see in uh natural lighting conditions, the selfies actually come out very good. The earlier selfie picks were before the latest software update. And in the latest software update, if you notice, the skin smooning is just too much. And in indoor lighting situation, it simply does not look that great with this much skin smooning. Recording this video in 4K 30fps. 4K 60 can also be done with the rearfacing camera. I mean, even 8K at 30 fps, but this is at 4K 30fps. And I'm just going to move around to give you an idea how it's doing it. Let me go closer to the object. Yes. Uh you're getting that natural background blur at the back. And let me just move back. So focusing is not an issue. Let me just point it over here. Very harsh, sunny India, summer, very hot. And let me bring back to the shadow area. So it's doing a very good job in terms of quick exposure changing. So that's good. Let's just walk to see how is the stabilization. And I'm just going to climb the stairs now. And again, the audio is being recorded via its internal microphone. So, I'm just climbing the stairs. At least in the preview, it looks good. But you guys let me know what do you feel about the video quality. Also, zoom in and zoom out. This is the default one. And this is zoomed out while shooting the video. We can also go to that 2.6x 6x or even 5x while shooting the video. So you can zoom in, zoom out and use all the lenses while shooting the video. Recording this video with 4K with the front-facing camera. And uh by default it is at 1080p, but you can set it to 4K. So I have actually set it to 4K. And uh I'm just going to walk around uh on the steps. Now I'm just going to walk around and at least in the preview it looks good, but you guys let me know. And it's very harsh lighting. It's that uh summer, very very hot. Uh so you guys let me know how it's handling uh the lighting and everything. And I'm just going to walk back also. And the audio is being recorded via its internal microphone. So you can also judge the quality of the microphone what it is. And now I'm just going to go in a slightly shadowed area. So this is how it looks in a slightly shadowed area. So, this is a very quick sample video recorded with the uh front-facing camera of the Xiaomi 15. Okay. So, that was regarding the camera. Certainly very good in terms of camera. But now, let's talk about the cons and some of the shortcomings that I have noticed with this smartphone. I've already told you about the charging speeds. If you keep it at high uh charging speed, the handset does tend to get pretty hot. And also, while I was uh doing wireless charging in my car, uh the handset actually gets very very warm to touch with wireless charging. So I will not suggest wireless charging. But again that is common with even with this one. This smartphone also when I wirelessly charge in my car gets super super hot to touch. One thing I do not like is that with regular usage I never had any heating issues or anything. It just gets slightly warm because it's summer. Uh but when I was using the camera continuously I would say for example taking five sixuh shots at a time. So maybe continuously using the camera for one or two minutes um just this smartphone back can get actually pretty hot to touch. That is something that I have noticed. And immediately I picked up the uh Xiaomi 15 Ultra also and did the same thing. And the Xiaomi 15 Ultra using this camera again for similar thing like five six shots continuously does not get as hot as this one. Don't get me wrong, it's not a dealbreaker. The iPhone I tested got actually hot a lot more compared to this one. But you have to be aware that if you're going to continuously use the camera, the if you touch the back of this one, it does tend to uh it actually you'll feel uh that it is actually getting hot. So I feel uh in thermals they could have done even better. But again I compared it to the iPhone 16 Pro. The iPhone 16 Pro in similar situations the same uh was getting a lot more hotter. But I thought you guys should know about the same. I feel this is a flagship smartphone from Xiaomi their flagship series. So they could have removed apps like gets app themes and all of the things for because I remember I actually uh put out a video I had got the review out of the Xiaomi tab. Uh I don't recall the model number about 2 3 months ago and in that one we did not have apps like gets app and all this thing and that tab was what starts at only 28,000. So, in your mid-range tablet, if you can remove some of the extra apps, why can't you remove that on your flagship smartphone? Uh, yes, it's very easy. It takes about a minute just to disable some of the notifications that you get from the themes app, the gets app and all those things. But in the first place, I would say on a flagship smartphone, why bundle all these apps? Keep it as optional. If people want to download it, they can download it. But don't preload it inside the smartphone in my frank opinion. So this is a feedback that I would like to give to Xiaomi and please also bring back the screen on time values for accurate battery analysis. It's a pain in the butt to actually get the correct SOT values for the uh smartphone with this Hyper OS uh stuff what they are doing. As you saw the camera performance was very very good particularly with the rearfacing camera. But if we talk about the front-facing camera here, I would say the front-facing camera was good, but it was no way outstanding or one of the best that I have seen. And I feel Xiaomi needs to work a little bit more on the front-facing camera. And also, I would like them to bring out the Leica enhancements that they have with the rearfacing camera even to the front-facing camera. With the frontfacing camera, there is no Leica enhancements that we will be getting. So, that is also one nitpick that I have. Uh apart from that in the camera UI this they can easily fix with the software update again you have these tabs over here. Uh and particularly if you are using a Leica camera or something uh you'll know that there is a black and white mode which gives a very dramatic pictures but to get to that you don't have a direct mode over here you have to go here to the filters and scroll all the way to this Leica natural or Leica high contrast. So again this actually takes a a little bit of steps I would say. Why not just have a black and white mode over here which makes your life a lot more easier I would say. So this is something that they can easily fix with a software update because I know many people who have a Leica camera like to toggle between those black and white modes and the regular modes quite a bit. uh but many times when I was quickly just taking the photographs it was a h and I wanted to capture the moment the by the time I went to the filters and selected that that moment had passed. So that is something that I would like them to add with the software update. Uh overall I have to say uh still after all these minor niggles and all those things let me talk uh talk about the conclusion that I've written. Still, I have to say one of the best compact flagship Android smartphone with good camera performance and battery life that we are getting. I wish Xiaomi cleans up the bundle software a little bit on their these flagship Android uh smartphones. Um and it'll make it even better I would say. And but still I have to say I like uh the fact that Xiaomi even uh they had just launched one variant which is actually at a very attractive price for 60,000. Um but still they are giving that 512 GB of storage and 12 GB of RAM with the same. So overall, I have to say if you are looking for a compact flagship Android smartphone that does not have that heating issues and also gets great battery life and want that great camera performance, I have to say the Xiaomi 15 stands out of the pack as of now. So certainly I can recommend uh to users who are looking for a compact Android uh flagship smartphone, the Xiaomi 15 is a very good one. Uh but what do you guys feel about this Xiaomi 15 and what do you feel about this uh review? Do let me know in the comment section below.

The youngest of the spring classics, it only began in the 1960s. This year with world champion, Olympic champion, former winners in Fernat Pickock, it was a stellar lineup as the riders left Mastit on the 255 km route. 34 climbs involved, over 4,000 m of climbing. And this year, returning to the route to the end, the Calbbert climbed for a third and final time. Before the finish, a slight change to the finish, but it's always a crazy combination of loops and laps in Dutch Lindberg in the far southeast of what is normally one of the flattest lands on the planet. If you come to Lindberg, though, you'll notice that there are hills in the low countries. Eight riders formed the break of the day. Four of them had already been caught by the time we got the first images. The rest were about to be caught. This was a fastmoving race and it was on course to be the joint fastest ever Amstill gold. UA team Emirates were controlling as we went into the final 60 km. Plenty more climbs still to come but not the current world champion. The former world champion was the man to launch the hostilities on the Hulber. Julian Alfilip now riding for TUDA Pro Cycling, putting in a stinging attack that for a moment even had Pugacha himself in trouble. Bugattacha and Alfilip would quickly open up a 10-second gap. By the time we got to the next climb, it was 12 seconds and things were about to change again. A seated attack from Pugatcha. Were we about to witness the same scene again? Pugatcha riding away. certainly looks so the world superstar was soon on his own. Half a minute of a gap and then Matias Skil Moza decided to set off in chase with 32 km remaining. 7ks further down the road and on the way to Falenberg for the penultimate time, Remco Napole darted across to join him. was the Belgian Olympic champions just second day of racing so far this season after he was involved in a training accident earlier on in the year. He'd won on his first day and he was on the way to trying to join Bugatta at the front as they came through to take the bell. The gap was still 20 seconds though with just under 15 km remaining. With eight kilometers to go, Pulacha was caught. A rarity, not for the first time in his career, but it doesn't often happen. Straight away, I was putting him under pressure. Skin was there behind. They were at almost a minute, but you never know in this race. We've seen hearts stopping comebacks before, haven't we? Just less than 5 km to go in the top trio about to take on the Calbear. An iconic climb returning as the final climb in this race and an iconic set of riders. The Olympic champ, the world champ, a top rider riding for lead. He will be at the back as a Nepal launched the sprint. The trio would get to the line. Pogbacha looked like he was coming around, but there was Ska right on the line. Unable to believe what he' just done. So much emotion pouring out skia and even apool the order but for not ending his classic season with a fourth place Michael Matthews so consistent in this race taking fit. So Bugattacha and Aanapool prove they are human or maybe the man to do the proving deserves all the credit. Matias Moza with the crowning moment of his career today. Little Trek have had a brilliant spring. This was the result they wanted and they took a huge win downing the two headline names in that top trio. Skin are winning. Bugachard in second in third with Fernat Matthews V Grego Bernut Pickock and Healey in a superb top 10. On the podium all the delight for Matias Ska who couldn't believe what he'd done. He better believe it. He's now one of the favorites going into the rest of the Arden week. Fleshwal on next Y next Sunday.

The way he plays the game, he's just like, ""Yeah, it's different."" You know, he's got right foot, left foot, speed, height, the awareness like for his position. [Music] I'm happy with that as well. Rolls-Royce in he just he just makes the game look easy. And on top of that as well, you know, he's a great lad. He's a great captain as well. You know, he helps all the young kids as well who are coming through. So just his overall thing as a man and as a player, he just yeah, he's yeah, my feel I get asked this question quite a lot to be fair and uh yeah, I probably say Virgil probably the the toughest opponent I've faced um in my career. So what specifically is that? Is that his physicality? Is it his ball playing ability? Cuz he is a complete center back or is it the fact that he can do a bit of everything? Yeah, I think it is the fact that he can do a bit of everything. Like um he's obviously big, powerful. Yeah. Um, reads the game well. Um, quick as well. So, uh, yeah, he's complete defender. Do you think he's the best center back in the world right now? Yeah. Yeah, fair point. Don't think many would argue with that. Any guesses who the fans thought was one and three. Van Dijk. Yeah, it is Van Dijk. Similar question really. What's he like to play against? Very similar. Yeah, very similar. like the awareness like for his position even when you get in a one v oneicky it's really tricky to get to get past him there's not there's not many that do and gets the products that he deserves no messing around with Virgil number one Royce Roy he's got everything you know um obviously I know him well but you know he's got right foot left foot speed height you know he's a leader um Thiago also he's he's amazing But I just think that Fergil's got that little bit more. I know he he doesn't he's not interested in becoming a manager and that's Fergil, but he's mostly the one I I pick when I want to give information during the game also because he's Dutch. So that helps in the language, but I think he has a good knowledge of the of the game. Just says, ""Who is the best player you've ever played against?"" Very rant. Yeah. Gordon, what's it like playing against him? What player, mate? He's got everything. Yeah, he's he's quick. He's strong. He's good looking. He's he's got it all. I can't really can't say a bad word about good looking. You think about that when you're playing against him. He's good looking. He's got everything. He's got everything. And then Van Dyke is Van Dyke cuz we played him twice now. How does it feel driving towards him though? Cuz I feel like there's I've seen a lot of videos of people like driving towards him and stopping. Do you get that nervous when when you're running towards him? No, not like at the time. I'm not thinking who it is. you kind of realize halfway through halfway through the battle like you oh yeah maybe you shouldn't have done that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But um yeah know he's just got it all and he and he's his swag as well. The way he plays the game is just like Yeah. It's different. I love that. Yeah. He's so good. Vond normally for me is the best during the last Yeah. four four years he was the best in the world. Okay. Next one says, ""Who is the hardest defender you've ever come up against in your career?"" Probably say Van Dijk. He's just got everything like big, strong, good on the ball, um aggressive. Uh so I think he's definitely one of um the best defenders in our time.

That doesn't make for a good picture defensively. But where's today surgery? Inasio Miguel missed the match against Sundowns. And again today we see Mango last gas replacement given how little game time he's had since and Chippa turn that around and shock Chiefs today and go above them in the league standings. This is the big Zaman Sakala who's joined the club in the January transfer window. Gets his body stuck in there almost immediately. [Applause] [Music] Sakala on the left and then very late challenge. Now Modi scored in the top game. There's a little bit of a mixup between Shabala and Noali. Not sure Shabbala got a call from his goalkeeper. most probably because I think he could have cleared that ball but instead just tried to you know let it uh his body sock it up I think on the right [Music] support and against one of the balls to Solomon needed a bit of first touches very quickly Sattorii is on his case here's Mark now ties the wrong lane shot. Mali makes the save. It does get the crowd going though. So even though the shot was perhaps a little bit tame and maybe just going off target, it does uh get a bit of momentum here for Kaiser Chiefs. The fact that it's a ground shot. I've spoke about the grass just now that June. So the World Cup final forward in case South African side made it to the final. Now we'll go in a bit of trouble. Edgelson in a bit of trouble and Sati on something goes you can see holding his head and he's like now this will tell us exactly what happened. Yes, it gets cluttered into by Shabala but that doesn't mean then you drop the ball. No, unless the whistle had gone then go thereafter instead of clearing that ball. And it's only a fair challenge here from Chabalada I would say. Yeah, they move as Martin up to Saka getting a flick on Cy's bursting through. Sergio Cummies with a chance turns little backfield into the path of Martin but you wonder if he shouldn't have snapped a little earlier. He's not the quickest Cummies and they caught him up but that's a very good breakaway chance for Chipper United. A rare moment for him to push that high having been a more defensive midfielder. This one breaks through. Amazing. joins late on this right hand side. They have a three in the middle. Cross inside off target. Little bit better from Kaiser Chiefs. Speed witness came out going forward. Might have J just done the tree but and remember Chipa on a high having been on the front foot with those set pieces. So a rare moment where space opens up for Cheese able to get that ball through. I think uh you got to give it to Chipa. They've held it. Serum's got a bit of space on header is straight into the grateful arms of Stanley Robi scored from Aona his D. This was just one of those moment but he couldn't generate enough power. If anything, it looked like a petta to the chance for Chiefs on the counter. Duba long range shot straight into the hands of Lavali. He was on target. Crowd gets excited over very lethreatening. But there's been such a lack of such moment that very number of times as he tries to line it up. I mean, yes, there was a bit of pressure, but it doesn't quite fall for him. I think he still takes it while he's still a bit higher. [Applause] Now, Ed Millson receiving treatment. Is that very well to hold up the ball that's given away by Solomons again, not for the first time. Martin is going to go for the shot. Just wide from Craig Martin. A gift really from Chipper. Was it in Gosa? Oh, Martin given the opportunity. The ball fell for him and he looked there wasn't pressure. There wasn't much. Yes, it's Martin. The idea was excellent. Yes, that's bit of pressure from Amodi. I think I'm not sure if M um Vuma is going to be able to get the on Sakala goes off. It's a little unfortunate for the big Zion. I thought he did well holding up the ball. Didn't get much in the way of service and confirmation. Solomons and Morris off looking for support. Arrives from Malefo across the face to goal that was struck with some power. Was he going for goal from that tight angle or was he hoping that someone would get a little touch onto that? That's exactly what happened sometimes. He hit the ball beautifully nice like mid mid height because you've tend the defense that they're facing their goal. They're all running so anything can happen. That's what he was here for Sereno. Oh, what was Miy trying there? Surely 24y old cross [Applause] inside well well wide. follows up. He attacks the ball beautifully and he gets the better of the defender as far as heights is concerned. He just needed to turn his head towards goal September back in head coaching role this time as a solo head coach there. That was a timely intervention from Shabalala because beautifully in an attempt to make his presence [Applause] felt trying to shot. That's nice of stum's hands and it looks to be off balance a bit where I didn't expect the jam to show because it looks very direct to me. Was it the first one on target as well from Chipper in this [Applause] game got it nice on the half volley like halfway line if you hit it with the laser will go all the way to touch. Shabbala for Serero just inject some energy in the midfield. Serino these days 33 years old maybe not as uh proficient in the run by himself. Now Miy slips his defender. That's good work from the keeper. Mi the first touch just showed a little bit too much. Yes. Yes. That's exactly where he lost the blood and which gave the goalkeeper the moment to come and make himself big. But still that leg stretch leg to make the block. Excellent. Maybe he needs to make this decision a little bit quicker. You don't have to go past the goalkeeper. Remember in the derby against China also he tried to go past. It's a beautiful first touch but that second touch lets him down big time. He really inject of lap power speed and maybe not so much build up. It's one of those that you can look for that ball behind the defense. Looks up with Moldi onto his right foot. Gets the cross in. It wasn't intended for Evan and Guard was going a little bit away from him, but on target. So, I'm not sure that was what he had in mind. Save made by the goalkeeper. That's a good save with that. And the goalkeeper it's it's dropping a little bit behind him.",1,The transcript provided is purely focused on the analysis and commentary of a soccer match between Chippa United and Kaizer Chiefs.

The Pariro Bay route has been the same since 1977 with the riders heading out from Compen to brave the cobble sections on route to the famous Veladrome, but the 122nd edition of this classic promised to be something extra special. Tad Pogachar and Matcha Vanderpole have gone pedal to pedal in recent weeks. Pogachar taking the tour of Flanders Vanderpole the Milan San Ramo. That meant their duel on the hell of a north was highly anticipated. It's yeah one of those special races where you work for a winter. So I think we are ready with the team to try and make it a success again. I think I always try to race on instinct but especially in rub there are so many things that can happen um on every cobble section. So yeah you just have to uh try to be in the race and uh yeah try to stay in front and hopefully no punctures. Pokar had participated in the junior version of the race, but this was his eagerly awaited senior debut on the cobbles that he'd already had a taste of on the tour to France. It means a challenge and uh yeah, I'm looking forward for that one because uh yeah, I trained a little bit this year on the cobos. I know them since yeah, I've been a junior, but I have not so good memories from them. But uh let's hope we can create some uh nicer memories this this year around. We are here to win uh the team and uh yeah we have very good strong riders. The motivation is super high guys are ready and uh I think me as well. So yeah we will try to fight for wing of course it certainly wasn't going to be a two- horse race though. Matts Pedison finished runner up on the tour of Flanders. Visma Lisa bikes Dylan Fanbala is a former Perry Rubé winner and teammate Fernard has finished on the podium twice. I don't know if if I'm in the shape of my life, but I'm definitely in a top shape and you know, I haven't been better ever in the classic. So, I'm I'm in a good position. Rubber is a is a different race than than Fllanders, for example. A lot more guys can um that can go for the win. Um it's unpredictable. Yeah. If everything comes together, then uh we have a good chance again. The beginning of the season was was complicated for me. I I think um it was hard to to find the right legs in the classics and uh from from Dar of Land on I I felt uh I felt like myself again and for sure it was good for uh for the morale to to be in a final again in Tur with yeah with the best riders. There were 259 km for the Pelaton from Compen to Rubé with 55.3 km of cobble sections that could make all the difference. They start at Tuavil AI, the first of 30 sections, including the famous Aaronburgg Trench and the Kafab, the tree crossroads, 17 km from the finish at Rube. Will the iconic Veladrome see a sprint finish, or will one man break away and get the chance to savor the moment as the winner of the 2025 Perry Rupe? It wasn't until the pelaton had sped over some 40 km at more than 50 km an hour that the first group managed to break away. Led by former Spanish champion Oya Lasano, the group also featured Lotto's Yasper De, Norwegian champion Marcus Hulgard and Kim Hedduk of Inos Grenadius. 60 km into the race and the gap for the lead group was more than two minutes which meant it was time for the teams of Pogatar and Fander Pearl to take matters in hand in the Pelaton. Nonetheless, the gap continued to grow and even crept over 3 minutes before the Pelaton started to eat into it with the first cobble section looming. The approach of the first major difficulty of the day meant the Pelaton got jumpy. Mache Mohoric was caught up in a crash as was Fenert. Fortunately for them, both men had helped to get back into the race, but with the wind at their backs, the breakaway group's lead was back to more than 3 minutes as they tackled the first cobble section. Some will be going forward, some will be washed away over the coming hours. But as we turn this corner, we get ready because we welcome you to hell. 302 163.2 km to go. Now we start to rumble. The Parve beckons for the Pelaton. Hannah nice and dusty this first sector. Three stars kind of right in the middle. Uh a little bit of grass left and right and no real indication of the rain of overnight. Falls are a big factor on the Par and the route is no respector of reputations. Yasper Philipsson second in each of the last two editions found that out the hard way. And it's not only the riders that suffer. Filipo Gana dropped back due to a mechanical problem on the first cobble section. FA did too. Pogachar, Fanderpole, and Pettison came through it safely, however, and while Ghana was a minute off the pelaton, Van worked his way back into contention. Back down the course, Little Trek took charge of the Pelaton's pace on the cobbles towards San Piton. But with less than 150 km to the finish, the breakaway still had more than 2 minutes in hand. Ghana and former winner Fanbala were in a group a further minute behind the race favorites. Having rattled along at more than 50 km an hour, the pace then dropped a little which gave some the chance to close. Ghana and Philipsson were among them with the cobbles at Harri almost in view. It was in the cobble section that the race favorites started to make serious moves. Pedison and Pocket attacked and the lead group started to thin out. Some 20 riders headed towards the Valair Forest as the breakaway was being reeled in. The tempo was at its peak as the race favorites headed towards the famous Aaronburgg Trench. Fandipole tried his luck once again in the Ararenburgg Trench as everyone tried to hang on to his back wheel. With the pace high, the breakaway group were picked off, leaving Fandearl, Pockchar and Pison at the front of the race in a lead group of some 15 riders. Fannet and Stefan Kung, fifth the last two years were not amongst them. Vander Pearl certainly wasn't going to wait for them. He stepped up the pace again and had Alpacasin Dunning teammate Philipsson to help him as he split the league group apart. World champion Pockachar was there though along with Pedison and Stefan Biser. Behind them a group of 10 including Vanard and Valisa bike teammate Matthew Brennan kept up the pursuit. Lady Luck also has her say on who emerges unscathed from the Parry Rube. 70 km from the line. She clearly wasn't going to make it P Edison's day. Denmark's former world champion suffering a puncture and that was the cue for Pogachar to step on the gas. Vanderpole and Philipsson stayed in touch, but Bissa's bike gave up on him, leaving the three riders out in front with 68 km to go and still 14 potentially perilous cobble sections to negotiate. With the line edging closer, the front three were sizing each other up. With 46 km left, Fander Pearl made a move. Pogachar followed and counterattacked. That all proved too much for Philipsson, leaving just two riders in contention. As the two heavyweights of World Cycling headed to the finish, Pogachar was the one to make the decisive error. Accelerating just a fraction too much into a tight corner. Fun Pearl didn't need asking twice. The gap was around 20 seconds even before Pogachar was forced to change his bike, meaning only Fander Pole himself or bad luck could deny him victory. With Pogachar looking safe for second, the race was on for the final place on the podium. The former Perry Rube runner up and Pogachar's teammate Florian Fer was in the mix, but so too were Pison and Fernat. There was a little scare for Fander Pearl at the tree crossroads, but he still had more than a minute in hand with less than 20 km left. As the former world champion headed towards the Veladrome, the current wearer of the rainbow jersey, Pogachar, had given up the chase. That left Fander Pearl to celebrate as he closed in on the third successive Harry Rube win. This rider is the man who conquers the 122nd edition of Barry Rube. The king of Rube, the triple, Matthew Vanderpool wins the 122nd Barry [Applause] Rub. Today Pogachar taking second place on his debut in the race and it was a sprint for third. Pedison eventually edging out Fenet to claim third for the second year in a row. [Music] So Macho Vander Pearl taking the 2025 Par to become only the third man in the history of the race to win it three years in succession. It means he's now won eight monuments of cycling. That's as many as Pocket. It means a lot. Um, it's such a hard race and I was really suffering. Yeah, too bad. Um, today had this mistake in the corner. Um, yeah, but then I just had to go for it, but it was still quite far until the finish line and it was really hard, especially with the last two se sectors with the headwind. Um, I was really struggling, but yeah, I'm happy uh to make it to the finish line. Fanderpole, Pogachar, and Pison the podium finishes for 2025. Fet and FA rounding out the top five. A special mention too for Marcus Hoggard and Yonas Ruch who were in the breakaway group and managed to hang on for a top 10 finish. But the day and the victory belonged once again to Fanderpearl, the undisputed king of the hell of the north.",1,The video transcript is a straightforward sports commentary of the Paris-Roubaix 2025 cycling race.

to one of our favorite Observatory decks ever we actually haven't been here since our very first time here in Japan but we just had to visit again because it's just so cool up there and one of the more unique Observatory Decks that we've been to [Music] pretend all right guys back at Shibuya Sky Tokyo is beautiful from down there but up here it's even more crazier this is an and I's favorite spot in Tokyo it's beautiful up here this is a must do for sure [Music] all right up here now it's actually really really cold up here right now and since an doesn't have a jacket she's staying inside at the indoor Observatory it's still beautiful down there as well but it's so cold right now cuz it is their winter season right now so this is like the iconic escalator that you see every on social media it's so popular because it's looking over Shibuya Crossing it's beautiful it's definitely a musty if you're in Tokyo like you cannot miss this trust [Music] me man Tokyo is just unreal look at this my gosh look at that view view everywhere all right guys this is actually the next day now cuz yesterday after Shibuya Sky it got so cold and it started raining yeah now we've bought scarves we' bought gloves we're warmer now we're actually going to hit up a cafe here in Shibuya it's called Ruru Cafe never been there before apparently this is a new Cafe and to be honest it might just just be aesthetic but we'll try it anyways yeah yeah let's go check it out man it is always a treat to be in Shibuya the energy of this concrete jungle is like no other that's why we keep coming back you can never find anything like this anywhere else yeah even though this is our third time like we always have to hit up Shibuya your trip is never complete without visiting Shibuya [Music] all right guys so we're inside Ruru Cafe now and we ordered already you actually have to order one drink and one cake per person and it's quite pricey to be honest we paid around 35 Japanese y for both of us so yeah quite pricey so far pretty cool concept the table is actual water so you can't be putting your phones on there but they do have baskets for all your belongings the only thing that you can put on the table is your drinks and the number for your order [Music] so we're just waiting for a drink and our cheesecake when we're at a cafe I'm usually like go like this but this is water so I got to like keep my hands to myself yep that's cold water it is a cool concept but I wish it was bigger it's quite small that was one of the downsides in the reviews that we read but let's see if the drinks and the cheesecake are any good cuz pretty pricey thank you thank you thank you thank you okay [Music] thank so an got the matcha that's their popular yeah I don't know how to act in this Cafe that is really good is it so this is cheesecake like what in the world it's black it's like Mochi on the outside look [Music] what the heck wa look at that it's like lava lava cake it's like a strawberry Mochi with a little bit of Cheesecake then the matcha powder on top just adds a little bit of flavor and's going to try her rock it looks like a pebble yeah it actually does look like a look squishy too oh my God it looks like Play-Doh it just tastes like cheesecake it doesn't taste like how it looks all right so far dessert is pretty good what I come back probably not it was good to experience it because it is really cool but [Music] expensive y'all really thought we were going to end the Vlog without showing you sh nah bro n check this out it's so crazy so chaotic it always put a smile on my face man check this [Music] out let's go cross this crosswalk it's still so chaotic as ever but I think that's what makes it so fun and so energetic here [Music] maybe only in Japan baby only in

and I SLE better than you I'm wired I am wired I'm going to get wired I'm drink I'm going to chug this coffee currently 5:25 and everyone around us has scattered they're gone gone it's not cuz we smell not this time not this time it's cuz we're just [Music] likey a [Music] we are now I want to say Garrett we're halfway there but we're not no we're like I don't know one3 oh no it's not I mean we're fine we're doing well staying strong everyone staying strong and I also have never felt myself this openly in public and it's making me so anxious like me so social anxiety is afraid of me I think it's just more anxiety inducing cuz we're in on the East Coast like so true you're so that's [Music] why after some of the shittiest plain food ever I decided to have some self-care with this mask I bought from Tik Tok shop that made me look insane we felt like monsters we actually scared our flight attendant and I was so excited to land I told Garrett to take a video of me and we finally got to South Africa yay my dad picked us up from the airport and then let's actually get to the South Africa Vlog now hi [Music] one thing I love doing in cap town is going surfing and I love this beach for that because the waves are consistently good and it's perfect for beginners as well you can rent a surfboard and wet suit too for a pretty affordable price this Cafe in mberg also has really healthy options and I decided to get a smoothie and this like really good chicken wrap after surfing for a couple hours [Music] while we were in South Africa I downloaded an eim from s instead of

code to download the app and use my code for 15% off at checkout we drove to [ __ ] Bay to go to their Sunday market which had a lot of fun items that honestly are perfect souvenirs or if I was living here I'd just be buying a ton of stuff for my home I ended up buying this really cool brass kind of arm bracelet I feel like it was just such a fun find G and I walked around the boutique here definitely a great place to come and then afterwards we met my cousin for drinks at this place called Aruba in downtown the plan for today was to go to one of my favorite wineries here in Cape Town I would go even as a kid and before you think oh underage drinking now there's a huge area where kids can play around it's almost like a park it's just so beautiful but first I wanted to have some movement to get over my jet lag so I wanted to show you what my relaxing mornings look like here in my dad's [Music] house also because I work remote I mostly did my work in the mornings when I woke up because I'm just way more motivated in the mornings I feel like once it gets past 2: p.m. I cannot open my laptop to save my life so I did this for a bit and then I walked upstairs to my dad's pool area where me and Garrett we're going to take some relaxing yoga together and just enjoy some refreshing morning movement side note I am now a certified Pilates instructor so while this was yoga I'm thinking about making some pilates workout videos let me know in the comments if you would like to see some of those and I will be launching a website with all of my Pilates plans so you can keep an eye out for that but anyways we did some weights and then we were ready to get changed for the day to drive to my favorite Winery Gro Constanta it goes W to get everything's easier we're here at one of my favorite wineries group kanta very excited so pretty we'll take you around on a little tour because love is on the my dad joined us so the three of us decided to do a five wine tasting which was equivalent to 8 USD and we tried to act like we knew what we were doing with tasting sniff good are you cking delicious afterwards we were all starving so we decided to go to this restaurant where my dad is actually friends with the owner which is really [Music] nice it would mean a lot if you come and support them if you ever visit Cape Town and I will have to say you have to try the pork belly it was my [Music] favorite okay now for probably the best part of the video we drove to go on Safari for the next few days we took a 4-Hour road trip to the city of George where my dad's beach house is located you can actually rent his house on Airbnb so I'll put the link down below and we stayed here for a few nights because the reserve we were going on was about 20 to 30 minutes [Music] away this morning I made myself some red roses tea which is South African English tea basically before getting ready for Safari I was so excited both of us dressed up feeling fantastic we both look so full of ourselves but you should be full of yourself we're going on some I put the link to this private game reserve down in the description because I can't remember how much everything had cost but if you want to check it out for yourself you can it's just such a gorgeous place I came here last year as well and it was so beautiful for day visitors they offer you coffee and snacks so we had to try this South African fried bread let's do it Che cheers wow it's really good M yeah look kind of like a dut except it's lot exactly tastes like a donut no it's B but I think it tastes better than it's much better than donut and after a little snack we were off to the reserve this was Garrett's first time ever on Safari so I was so excited to have him do it with me look how close these rhinos were I was honestly so intimidated and instead of me talking through it I'm just going to let you enjoy the beautiful [Music] scenery [Music] dreams L beene to make to get a winner from to dust I no time for chill no time for yard I push Ive I pr for better life day say I know F yes but I know give up I Pro my time will come I will shine I'm make I'm be someone be I know my dreams my goals I'm attack but iy I Hard fly my dreams my goals I achieve [Music] easy but [Music] I afterwards we came back to the main Lodge to enjoy some lunch and we had to try spring B which is actually South Africa's na animal baracho baracho we already tried it just now yeah for Tik Tok but it's really good surprisingly really good no it's really good cheers I'm about two ow [Music] in almost right I forgot we're supposed to all right supposed to be like [Music] yumo we're going to go on Horseback [Music] sa I didn't notice I had sunscreen all over my neck this was probably my favorite experience of the whole trip going on a horseback Safari I made a video of me doing it last year at the exact same Reserve but it was just such an amazing experience I had to do it again honestly me and Garrett were thinking about doing it again the next day because you get right up and close with the animals I think because obviously you're on a horse and the Animals aren't afraid of other horses on foot instead of like a big loud car and the entire time I felt like a cowgirl Going Through [Music] Safari you make me feel you see me I am in love I feel all it's been about 2 weeks since I've seen civilization I could never be an actress I'm so bad we also cancered quite a bit when we got to more flat areas and I actually galloped on my horse but I didn't get a video of that it was so fun we just let them take off and go loing I feel so loved all the time I feel your love all the time [Music] oh sorry I'm like staring at my food let's get ready together for first Thursdays here in Cape Town South Africa so first Thursdays is exactly what it sounds like it's the first Thursday of every month they shut down this street downtown I think it's called be Street and there's a lot of like popup DJs on the streets with their I forgot what they're called like DJ sets is that the right word and they just play a bunch of like house afro house it's a very like fun young Vibe and I went last year actually with my friend Caitlyn so I'm excited to go again this year last year we actually went with my dad which was really sweet that he brought us there but it's going to be a completely different vibe this time cuz it's going to be me and Garrett and I feel like going out with your friends in your 20s versus going out with your dad is completely different even though love you dad I would love for you to be there as well it's just a different vibe you know my dad made us his specialty jonic which I will show you the recipe I think I'll show it like right here maybe really quickly really Cheers Cheers M so good but it's special because it's pink pink and pretty perfect for little princesses I also just did a lip liner and I feel like I need to rub some of the like excess off here cuz it looks a little big or maybe I'll just add some like gloss and it'll look better okay I'm honestly done trying to film myself against my mirror cuz my phone keeps falling but I wanted to show you what my outfit for tonight looks like because I love it I think it's it's kind of funny in my head I'm like either this looks super Choy because I'm wearing animal print in South Africa or it's like such a sigh because of like yes que the confidence like wear what you want [ __ ] and that's what I'm going for like I honestly I think at this point in my life I just want to live my one life that I have and if people judge me then that's okay even though I know I'm probably going to be thinking like do I look crazy for wearing cheetah print probably not though I think it's cute I like it so let me give you a full look of it if my phone will stay we got this top I got from Tik Tok shop which I Really Love Actually it's very flattering I love the offsh shoulder look and then this just ties around your neck and I don't even have to like tie it fully I just kind of let it hang there it's really fun and then I'm wearing this skirt actually from I think it's Zara yes I'll look but got this skirt it looks like fun short party in the front but actually it's very business appropriate in the back super super appropriate so I love it for that I'm also wearing this armband that I got in [ __ ] Bay about few minutes from where I'm staying um I got it on a Sunday market and it's just so cute so cool I love supporting local too so really happy I could buy this um this piece but yeah this is the fit and then for shoes I'm quite tall so I'm 510 I'm thinking I'm going to actually we kitten heels because I don't really want to wear sneakers with this and my kitten heels are surprisingly more comfortable than my blue sambas so that's what we're going for and I might borrow Garrett's jacket we took an Uber because obviously we were going to be drinking we were both so excited and the Uber was only about 12 USD to go from mberg to downtown first Thursdays happens on Breeze Street and they shut down some of the streets so that popup DJs can just play music it's so freaking cool we also randomly got boy rolls and it came with like a Red Bull and we could go inside and get a shot for it too which is so cool so we started our night strong with vodka Red Bulls and a good old South African hot dog basically it's the diarrhea dog South African Edition yeah honestly they're pretty good though so pretty good and we got a free drink that's always a good thing we were trying to walk to the night club and we got blocked off G20 which I don't know what that is but gett says it's crazy it's like the biggest Congregation of world leaders that's crazy every year that's insane and we were like oh how do we get there and he's like you can't this happened to me in Zurich really yeah but it was for a a different Summit what the [ __ ] that's insane what that's [Music] [Music] insane you make a [Music] somehow we ordered drinks on fire and it has a shot with [Music] it Dany Bano Stag Night Stag Night Stag Night Stag Night [Music] the next day we were both so hung over but my dad wanted to take us to Kirsten Bosch Gardens it's 1250 USD to enter and there's a beautiful Cafe and Restaurant with great brunch and lunch items this was honestly just a day of recovery and food so if you want to skip to the beach day Skip to the next portion how is it it's so good really fresh but I wanted to show you another great comfort place called Tiger's Milk in mberg [Music] [Music] we just did a little bit of shopping what is this area called that in Green Market Square Green Market Square and and Long Street and Long Street Garrett bought some really cool things and now we're going to go actually get lunch at the waterfront we're going to go to timeout Market which by the way is Timeout magazine called Cape Town the number one city of the world in 2025 or was it 2024 2025 2025 so

[Music] Last meal type thing. [Music] No, no way out here. So, we just got to Osaka. This is actually our first time here. It's 9:00 p.m. We had like the longest travel day. So, we're going to hit the spa and then go to bed. [Music] These 7-Eleven pancakes are literally our favorite. Like a morning brush with a view, huh? About time, these sleepy heads. What? [Music] [Music] We're in line for the skewer place. How did you find this? Shout out to Tak for this one. He's a local. He grew up in Japan. just opened. Come here early. I saw on Tik Tok that if someone has real fruit cut, that means it's 100% real fruit. It has a real fruit that's whole, it has like 97%. And then if it's just art like this, you know, it has less than 5%. The more you know it tastes like rate it. [Music] Oh, cutie ones. Yeah. We went to a store that carried this brand last year and we're up in Osaka and found it. They have the cutest dog clothes. Okay, so I found this place save. It's called Kindle and it's like a vintage designer resale store, but the prices were kind of expensive. So, we're going to check out Second Street. [Music] [Music] So refreshing. [Music] We're at Dough Ton Bur in Osaka. We came here earlier today and it was so dead. So, this is definitely the place to go at night. Brandon took us to a really good udon spot. We're going to head over to the iconic area over the river. Feel like this is kind of a tourist essential. the fact that [Music] and one of the [Music] [Applause] [Music] candy have this. No, there's something [Music] So, instead of going to the train station to get your ticket, one of the easiest ways is to just add it on your wallet, you can just add money straight from your phone. That easy. Going somewhere fun today. We're taking the kids to one of our favorite places. We went last trip. Yep. We could take the JR line, but the local train is going to be a little bit cheaper. Just a little bit extra time. [Music] [Applause] Matcha. I want matcha. So, we just got to Kyoto. A couple days ago, it snowed here and it looks like it's actually trying to snow. We're on a mission right now to Oh my god. Is that her? That's her. [Music] Okay, thank you. First time having sushi this entire trip and I forgot that Victoria, this is her first time in Japan, period. She's not interested in the touristy things. Yeah. Which, thank God. It's pretty busy today still. So, we're going to get some sushi lunch. There's a little bit of a wait time, but it looks like a tiny little restaurant. We are staying in Osaka for a couple of days still, so it's nice just to do like a quick little day trip over. Took some local trains and took about an hour to get over here, but it went by pretty fast. Tomorrow, I got tickets for the Osaka Aquarium, which I'm a big aquarium girl, so I'm really excited for that. Osaka seems to be like a good home base for a couple of days. There's some day trips that we have planned, and so far the weather has been pretty good. Definitely bring gloves, scarves, thermal layers, comfortable walking shoes. [Music] Oh my god. Gotcha. Like they're opening a Pokémon. [Music] The sushi is really good. End up being around $25 a person. We're walking to kind of like an iconic street where you get a view of the temple. [Music] [Music] Last year when we came to Japan, one of our friends in Tokyo told us this was one of his favorite restaurants in Kyoto. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Thank you. [Music] making the silliest face. [Music] [Music] Rate it 10. Everything I wanted to see. I love the jellyfish room and they had the huge tank with like the sharks and the manor rays and you got to see it from so many different angles. I'm glad we went. And it was only like 20 something dollars per person. [Music] Pretty good short rest. Said it's like a last meal type thing. Just went back to freshen up. They had these Wagyu rice boxes came with a side of like dashi soup and I swear that healed me. It was near like Doan Bur areas. Quite a couple restaurants that all serve the same thing. We got like no weight on a Friday. Off to our next adventure. [Music] One thing I love about Japan is there's an abundance of restrooms everywhere with bed and they're all heated and they're all free. But we just got to Nara. It was about three or four transfers from Osaka. Not too bad. I've always wanted to go and see the deer. Going to try to catch it before sundown. [Music] Oh, okay. [Music] Eight and a half. I give an eight. We had chicken, egg, and pork. And it was really good. Good on a cold day. [Music] Good afternoon. We just had the biggest lunch at 7-Eleven. We filmed a haul. So, if you guys want to see that video, it'll be uploaded separately. They're sold out of pancakes. So, now we're going to go into Los Pancakes. You'll be your Christine Pancake. Hate to see me coming. Who wants one? Normally, these come with butter and maple syrup. Don't get it from Lawson. Pretty good though. It's pretty good, but you have to get it from 7-Eleven. Is it sweet? Yeah. [Music] Super Express bound to the [Music] We just arrived in Tokyo. We took about a 2 and 1 half hour shinkansen from Osaka. We had a great time there. It was our first time in Osaka. We're actually on the way to a standing sushi bar that Brian and I have been to in the past. It's around 5:00 p.m. on a Saturday evening, so hopefully it's not too busy. [Music] The world's first milk tea place ever. This is so awesome, guys. I actually got it, guys. I want it. How the heck are you going to grab a box? This is the Shabuya crossing. [Music] Found everything we're looking for allegedly and more. [Music] Crazy Saturday evening. Some proper street. [Music] Morning. Boys are off on their own adventure today, but Victoria and I are headed to a lash appointment. [Music] Joe and I spent the morning at Oido Antique Market. First time going there. That was super cool. And now the girls, they are getting their lashes done and we're going to meet them for lunch. So, we were going to eat here. That's our favorite udon place, but the line was just way too long. Still long. [Music] Best ramen I've ever had in my life. Vic and I had our eyelashes done. The appointment took about 2 hours. My eyelashes kawaii. Such a great job, but it was a little bit out of the way. It was like an LED lash, which I've always wanted to try. It's around $100, which is insane for a full set. And the LED is an add-on, which means if I didn't do the LED, it would have been like $80 worth. So, right now, we're going to this place I have saved that I saw on Tik Tok, and they do a Coca-Cola tasting drink using lots of spices, healthier [Music] Coca-Cola. They sell the syrups. [Music] We went and bought like three of the syrups before even trying it. So hopefully this is good. Wow. That's yummy. Rate it 10. I'm definitely buying the big one now. Get back in line. Doesn't think we should get anymore. I think three is good. The No, I like it. The first That one's really good. They're both honestly really good. I didn't just try to go to the store. What did you say? Out of stock. It kind of blew up on Tik Tok, I think. But they have like affordable, really nice denim. [Music] Looks different. [Music] The next stop is a mango jalapeno with tequila or [Music] mess. We got a long walk, so we're going to look up. [Music] Hey, post dinner desserts. How was dinner for you guys? So delicious. Fantastic. Best tonkatu of my life. Boom. [Music] We've been to that Katsu place before, but we've been dying to go to a bar that's across the street. Great vibes. They're playing like good records and everything. The drinks were really good, and it definitely was a little bit more pricey, especially with Japanese standards, but it still ended up being around $30 a person with all the drinks and snacks we got. So would highly recommend doing that especially if you're going to go to [Music] [Music] [Music] Buddhami toilet. First time trying this. It's spam with codro. It's my dream sandwich. M. A lot of mayo. Really good. Christine is off to get her nails done, which they are way grown out, so I'm excited. But I've been to this nail salon before. It's called Nail Seeker in Shinjuku. And while I'm in there, Bren's going to go look around for my dream camera. Screaming sound. Thrown out as hell. [Music] No luck on the camera stores. They all had vintage film cameras which were great. But yeah, looking for that Fujifilm X100 proving to be pretty tough. Yoashi sold out at all their locations. Let's go check out Christine's nails. Yep. So fun. Yeah, these ones are my favorites. Oh, this one here. Raining in line. I'm so hungry and I have to pee. [Music] Now you're going to get something fire [Music] three ac $30. Wear them with my boots. I see y'all. [Music] Okay, this is where we want to go next. Samoya Cafe. Miss the dogs. Need to pet. Turns out you have to make reservations in advance, but it is all you can drink. Another purchase. Y is taking advantage of me up here. What did you say it looked like? Looks like Brooklyn. Let's go say hi. [Music] About to get at least 10 outfits for each dog. Oh my [Music] [Music] god. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music] last night. We went to Team Labs Borderless, which I've actually been to years ago. It was so cool. Very photogenic. I feel like a lot of digital art museums try to be that, and it was such a fun experience. And then afterwards, we went to this pizza spot that I've heard so much about called Seavoy, Tomato, and Cheese. I think it won like top five best pizzas. They had a bunch of award stickers. It was incredible. And we had a really unique one with tuna on it. I don't think we've ever had a pizza with fish. No. And if any place is the place to do it, it's strong. Yeah. [Music] [Music] Dang, this is so good. Crispy cream could never How many booms? 10 booms. Boom. [Music] [Music] Good grab and go udon place. How many booms? Five booms. I don't know what this whole boom scale is, but lots of booms. Welcome to Shimakiawa. Hopefully that's how you pronounce it. This whole area we had on our list for a while. All like vintage antique stores. [Music] Do you love it? No. So cool. What did you say? Let's keep going. What? They said, ""Let's go."" Donkey. Donkey. in a while. [Music] [Music] Oh my god, that was a fight. Oh yeah, for sure. Yeah, you're in the background. [Music] She was [Music] [Music] enjoying our lives. How many boom? 35 booms. Boom. Nice. How many booms? 57 17,000 35. [Music] Oh, [Music] hey. Last night we went to a yakuniku. Our friend Tommo served us the last time we were here. All of us agreed it is single-handedly one of the best meals we've ever had. It is a little bit on the pricier end, but you have your own like private booth. It's a memorable experience. Yeah. Today we're headed to Senoji Temple. We're going to do some street food and then hit Kapabashi for some of the souvenirs that we need to [Music] get. The tourist trap. We'll feed each other. [Music] Put mustard in [Music] these. Heat. Heat. [Music] That was 10 out of 10. So worth all of us already with poodles. [Music] [Music] Oh, that was so horrible. [Music] It actually works. My That's so my So, we're walking around Akihabara. Want a couple bag charms from the claw machines. We shopped around Kopabashi, which is kind of like a restaurant supply home store. We got some customized knives which make great gifts if you're looking for any sort of like little dish home wares. You can get everything for such a good price. And I was specifically looking for a matcha whisk and bowl and was able to find that. Now back home, refresh and dinner after. [Music] [Music] Minecraft. [Music] Okay. Just ate at Joe's favorite yakinika place. 10. [Music] [Music] Go. Come on. [Music] We just had these oonie bowls from this place that Brandon has had saved. We tried five different types of oonies. I wouldn't say it's the best oonie I've ever had. It was really good. It was really good, but I do feel like it was a little bit touristy, maybe. So, we're walking around the rest of the fish market trying to find some more snacks to eat. It's already around noon and it's getting pretty busy. So, if you come, definitely need to come early. [Music] Desert. [Music] Right. The fish market. I take away a boom. Seems like very touristy. Yeah. Expensive. Fish was good. Oonie was actually decent, but outside of that, we didn't really get anything else. So, it was so crowded. We got like these like mediumsized oysters. There are better oysters in Seattle. [Music] [Music] I wear these. I blacked out. They had major socks there. Literally, every single shoe we wanted to try, they had in our size. So, clearly we had to buy multiple [Music] pairs. [Music] Hold on. We're back. Just walk. Just walk in. Yes. This is my third time here in Japan. And they went last night. [Music] favorite coffee shops in Tokyo. The owners over there super nice. They also do bike tours, so highly recommend checking that out. [Music] I'm [Music] so beautiful. [Music] Tell [Music] us. We waited about an hour for this place. It's near Shabbashi station. It's like a dipping noodle almost like soba restaurant, but it was really, really good. Five normal. [Music] Five. Beautiful. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] So We are in Hokon. We had the longest travel day yesterday. It took us almost 4 hours to get here. It's honestly very confusing to get here from Tokyo because there's so many different transfers. We had to take a bus and took it like the wrong way. Anyways, we made it. We have a full day. And from here, I think you can see Mount Fuji. And Hokon also has its own little mountain with like gondilas that you can ride up and see the view. So, we have a full nice little day trip. [Music] [Music] So cute. Legend has it the eating one extends your life by 7 years. [Music] Yeah. In my bags over there. First impressions. It's really yummy. I'm glad it tastes good. But it might be a normal egg like dipped in black paint. Don't say that. [Music] You want to ride a goose? Want to ride a goose? [Music] This place got rated on table. Uh, I think got like a 36. Where are we going? To the open air museum. It's got a Yeah, it's like 20° today. It is not 20°. We walking around. Absolutely freezing. Bro, it's 38°. It's almost 40. It's cold as hell. Nothing. Okay. Yes. I like their sewing. Looks like mommy. Our hotel car coming to pick us up. [Music] [Music] Good [Music] fight. So, we woke up early to take the Wisconsin to Narita Airport. Most taxis run at 6:00 a.m., so keep that in mind. Got some venture boxes. We have a quick ride to the airport and then we go to [Music] Korea. 3 hours later, we've made it to airport.

to another travel vlog. This time,   my mom and I made a 10-day trip to several 
cities in Belgium, and then Amsterdam in the   Netherlands. This is part one and will feature 
our time in Brussels, Ghent, and Bruges.   Belgium has so much incredible architecture, 
history, and of course, chocolate and waffles—   and I can’t wait to share it all 
with you. So let’s get started! Our journey started on a red-eye flight, which 
unfortunately ended up being delayed a few times.   But luckily we did take off, and after about eight 
hours we finally made it to Brussels, the capital   of Belgium. We hopped on the train that would 
take us to Central station in the city center.   I was so glad our hotel was nearby 
because lugging our suitcases over   all of the cobblestone was quite a challenge. But first we ran into this stationary store, 
where I found some of the cutest cards ever.   I actually love collecting cards from around the 
world and saving them for whenever they’re needed. We kept making our way to the cafe and ended 
up at the Mont des Arts garden. This garden was   originally built for the 1910 Universal Exhibition 
and provides a beautiful view over the city. At last, we made it to Bouche, a cute cafe 
serving specialty coffee, pastries, and light   seasonal dishes. It was so great to have a cup 
of coffee after basically pulling an all-nighter. Happily caffeinated, we walked over 
to the Galeries Royale Saint-Hubert,   a beautiful shopping arcade. It holds many 
of the most renowned Belgian chocolate shops,   and we had to stop by a few of 
them. I was honestly so impressed   with the sheer amount of chocolate 
everywhere, and it all looks so good. There’s a bookstore inside of the Galeries 
named Tropismes which looks like it could’ve   been taken out of a storybook. The 
architecture is so beautiful inside,   though they don’t sell many books in English. We walked through the mall some 
more and hopped into this gallery   which held some pretty interesting art. 
And this is a shop selling art on wood. Belgium is well-known for its lace, and we saw 
lots of it being sold in all different forms. After leaving the galleries, we headed to 
the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula.   This is a medieval Roman Catholic cathedral 
dedicated to Saint Michael and Saint Gudula,   the patron saints of the City of Brussels. 
It showcases these stunning stained glass   windows, most of which date from 
between the years 1525 and 1663. Before heading back to the hotel to check 
in, we found ourselves at Grand Place,   the central square in Brussels. This square is 
probably Brussels’ most memorable landmark and   is surrounded by buildings such as the city’s 
Town Hall and City Museum. This historic square   epitomizes the grandeur of 17th-century Flemish 
architecture and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. We rounded back to our hotel to check 
in, and here’s what our room looked like! For dinner we went to Wolf, a food market with 
vendors serving different global street eats,   tap brews, and wine. I loved how they had 
lots of different Asian options, and we ended   up choosing to eat Indian food. I got the butter 
chicken and my mom got the chicken tikka masala. And get ready to see us eating a LOT of Asian food 
this trip, because we just really love Asian food. We still had room for a little more 
food in us and since it isn’t a trip   to Belgium without getting fries, we 
stopped by this frites stop called   La Friterie. We got the frites 
with the tartare maison sauce. We walked to Central Station, got our 
tickets, and hopped on the train to Ghent. When we made it to Ghent, we called an 
Uber to get us into the city center. Our first stop was Labath for some 
coffee and breakfast. I love boiled   eggs and soldiers and they happened to 
have it on the menu! I still don’t know   how to properly open one of these eggs, 
but the food and coffee were delicious. My mom had booked us a canal cruise not too 
far away, so we headed to that next. It was   absolutely gorgeous outside, which made 
it the perfect day to be out on the water. Our tour guide was so nice 
and pointed out different   landmarks we passed by throughout the city. After the tour was done, we walked over 
St. Michael’s bridge, where you could   look down Graslei and Korenlei, the 
canalside streets lined with historic   buildings. As you keep walking, you could 
also see the main ‘three towers’ ahead:   Saint Nicholas Church, Belfry 
Tower, and Saint Bavo’s Cathedral. This is the inside of Saint Nicholas Church. We also went into Saint Bavo’s Cathedral, which 
has the most stunning gothic architecture. We were pretty hungry and chose 
to eat lunch at this cute brunch   and teahouse called Alice. They offer 
lots of breakfast and lunch options   and I ordered the warm toast with brie, 
honey and walnuts, which was pretty good. We continued walking through Ghent 
and passed by Gravensteen Castle,   a medieval fortress in Ghent’s city center. We then reached Graffiti Street— which is 
exactly what its name implies— a walkway   surrounded by walls full of street art. These 
walls serve as a public canvas for street artists,   and all of the art was so impressive. I 
especially loved seeing this Pokemon art. By now we weren’t quite sure where our 
next stop was, which meant it was time to   figure it out at a cafe. We went to Take 
Five, which had some excellent coffee. We decided to just walk around the city 
center a little more and learned that there   was actually a rowing competition happening 
right then and there. It honestly looked like   a lot of fun for the rowers and we 
enjoyed watching for a little while. We figured it was about time 
to head back to Brussels,   so we took an Uber to the train station 
and caught the earliest train back. It was raining by the time we got back into 
Brussels, but it was dinner time and we had to   eat. We chose this ramen spot called Takumi Ramen 
that had incredible reviews online. Little did I   realize that they have multiple locations 
of this spot all over Brussels and beyond.   The ramen really was incredible 
though— I was impressed. On our way back to the hotel we passed through 
Grand Place and were surprised to find it lit   up in purple. Since there were so many chocolate 
shops located in the square, I stopped by Neuhaus   and after receiving a sample of this new vegan 
chocolate they have, ended up buying a box. And that’s the end of day two! I had seen so many recommendations online for 
the waffles here and was very excited to have   my first Belgian waffle of the trip. I 
will say these definitely lean on the   sweet side and probably would go better as a 
dessert, but I still loved it for breakfast. Next, we headed north of the city center to 
see one of Brussels’ most notable landmarks:   The Atomium. But first, we actually went to the 
cutest little theme park that was right next door. Mini-Europe is a park featuring 350 miniatures 
depicting European countries and landmarks. After   entering, you follow an animated tour with visual 
and sound effects which are all so cute. The   attention to detail is crazy and I loved seeing 
all of the moving pieces and interactive elements. They even put the olympic rings 
on the Eiffel tower miniature. After finishing our tour of Mini-Europe, 
we headed over to the Atomium. The Atomium is a landmark modernist building that 
was originally constructed as the centerpiece   of the World’s Fair in 1958. Now it serves as a 
museum, an art center, and cultural destination.   The inside is spaceship-like and features 
large-scale multi-level digital installations. Honestly, I probably wouldn’t recommend going   inside the Atomium. Here’s a pretty 
mediocre view from one of the atoms. One of the biggest icons of Brussels is this 
little statue called Manneken Pis. This 55.5   centimeter bronze fountain sculpture is one of 
the best-known symbols of Belgium and I swear,   every souvenir shop in Belgium was 
selling something depicting it. Next, I stopped by Chocolaterie Mary 
to buy some more chocolate to bring   back as gifts. I love the elegant 
packaging this chocolate comes in! So by now we just wanted a spot to 
rest at and I found this cafe called   Wide Awake to do just that. We got ourselves 
some delicious afternoon coffee and just sat   there for a little while before we 
decided to return back to the hotel. For dinner, we grabbed some fast-casual 
food at this spot called Gatsu Gatsu. Here   you can create your own stir fry noodle 
base and include a variety of different   ingredients of your own choosing. 
We took it back to the hotel to eat,   and I was really pleasantly surprised 
about how good the food was. And that was the end of our day! So we made it to our last morning in Brussels! 
My mom and I headed out for breakfast and found   the city to be quite messy in the morning. 
We walked over to Frank, an Australian-style   breakfast and brunch spot serving dishes 
made from locally sourced ingredients. I got the yogurt and granola and a 
cup of the filter batch brew coffee   to wake me up. It was a pretty solid breakfast. On the way back to our hotel, my mom wanted 
to stop by this chocolate shop to get some   more gifts. This shop had soo many options and we 
left with a lot more chocolate than we expected. And then it was time to check out, 
so we packed our bags and headed   to the train station where we caught 
the soonest train to our next city. Ok there’s no pretty visual here 
but we made it to Bruges! We   took a taxi to our hotel which was very 
conveniently located in the city center. Bruges is a stunning medieval city known for 
its well-preserved architecture and charming   canals. We started off by visiting Market 
Square, the main historical square in Bruges,   and a hub of activity for both locals and 
tourists. Surrounded by historic buildings,   the square features the iconic Belfry Tower 
which offers panoramic views of the city. Walking a little further, we 
came across Chocolatier Dumon,   a renowned family-owned chocolate shop that’s 
famous for its artisanal Belgian chocolates. For lunch, my mom was craving a burger so 
we ended up at this spot called Ellis. They   had this Seoul burger which looked pretty 
insane, but neither of us ended up ordering   it. My mom liked her burger here but I 
didn’t really like this place so much. Belgium is well known to celebrate 
Christmas with markets and decor,   and we had to check out this Christmas 
shop by Burg Square. Even though it was   still technically summer, this shop 
really got me into the holiday mood. Next, we went to Burg Square, which 
is surrounded by historic buildings   such as the City Hall and the 
Basilica of the Holy Blood. We stopped to watch these musicians for a 
little while and also saw this adorable dog. And then we got some waffles on a stick! 
Here, they cook Belgian waffles to be eaten   on a stick and lather them in white, 
milk, or dark chocolate and a topping   of your choosing. My mom got hers with 
white chocolate and I got mine with milk.   We took our waffles to the square afterwards 
to eat them, and omg, it was so good. We set out for That’s Toast, a restaurant with an   exciting all-day breakfast concept 
serving a variety of toast dishes. I   ordered the Triple French and my mom 
ordered the All Day Breakfast Plate. I think this was my favorite 
breakfast of the trip. After breakfast we planned to see 
some of the more scenic parts of   Bruges. But first look at how 
bad my mosquito bites were. Ok now that you’ve seen that, I’ll show you 
what I think is the prettiest spot in Bruges. This is St. Bonifacious Bridge, which is often 
called the “bridge of love.” It was built in the   early 20th century and blends seamlessly 
with Bruges’ older Gothic architecture.   It is one of the most photographed 
spots in the city for good reason. We made our way to another famous location 
in Bruges: Rosary Quay. Located where the   Dijver and Groenerei canals meet, its’s 
another popular spot for photos, especially   with its backdrop of gabled buildings, stone 
bridges, and the Belfry Tower in the distance. As you can see, we decided to hop on one 
of the canal cruises leaving from that   very spot. It was a good time of day 
and there weren’t too many crowds out. Like in Ghent, our tour guide spoke 
in English, French, and Dutch,   and pointed out lots of cool points of interest. I 
was just in awe of how truly beautiful Bruges is. Back on land, my mom and I visited 
the Basilica of the Holy Blood,   located in Burg Square. This Catholic 
church is famous for housing a relic   believed to contain the blood of Jesus 
Christ, and the relic is displayed to   the public during religious ceremonies and 
the annual Procession of the Holy Blood. My mom really wanted to see a 
windmill so we found one that   was a 20 minute walk away from Burg 
Square. The walk was super pleasant—   all of the streets looked so quaint and 
beautiful, and it was just so peaceful. There are four main windmills in Bruges and 
we were able to see two of them. I don’t   think I can properly pronounce their names 
though, so just read them on the screen. We walked back towards the city center and 
realized we were famished, so we popped into this   restaurant called Paradise and shared this plate 
of pierogis which was actually insanely good. Happily fed, we walked to the Beguinage 
“Ten Wijngaerde”. This is the only surviving   beguinage in the city of Bruges, founded 
in 1244 by Margaret II of Constantinople.   A beguinage is a complex housing beguines: 
women who chose to live a religiously devout   life without taking permanent vows 
or joining a formal religious order. While walking back to our hotel, we had to 
stop for a Belgian waffle from Chez Albert.   The waffles are the perfect size for a 
snack and they offer lots of different   options for toppings. I got the one 
with chocolate and whipped cream,   and the verdict is— I think this spot 
is my top choice for a Belgian waffle. For dinner we went to Poules Moules, 
a restaurant known for its chicken   and seafood. Since neither my mom or 
I like seafood (don’t come for us),   we both ordered chicken dishes. I got 
this curry pasta which was pretty good! Before turning in for the night,   we walked through Market Square 
again to catch it just before sunset. The next morning my mom and I woke 
up early to climb Belfry Tower when   it opened. Belfry Tower is 83 meters 
tall and the only way to the top is   by climbing 366 narrow steps. So we mentally 
prepared ourselves and just got to walking. At the top you can see panoramic views of Bruges.   Honestly, I feel like the view isn’t really worth 
it, especially since the space at the top is so   tight and the fencing and the architecture 
slightly block the view. But it was still   a cool vantage point nonetheless. You can 
also hear the bells up close and personal. It just so happened to be the day that Bruges’ 
Wednesday Market was open at Market Square,   so I headed back down the 
366 steps to check it out. The Market in the Markt is full of 
stalls selling all types of foods,   flowers, and gifts. You can find fruit 
and vegetables direct from the farm,   local cheeses, meats, plants, freshly baked 
bread, sweets, and hot rotisserie chicken.   Flowers are sold depending on the season, 
and I really wish I could’ve bought some! So I was really craving a banana and I was 
too nervous to try to buy a single banana   at the market so I ended up getting a Belgian 
waffle with banana on it at this cute truck. And then it was time for us to check out 
and sadly leave this beautiful city. My   mom and I packed our bags once again 
and took a taxi to the train station. Catch part two of our trip which 
will include our next stops,   Antwerp and Amsterdam. Thanks as 
always for joining along. Bye!",1,The video content is a straightforward travel vlog detailing a trip to Belgium

to get in and amongst the festivities see what this country is about and see what Mischief we can get up to so you notice everywhere people are holding up these things these decorations I'm not entirely sure what they are but they obviously have something to do with the the new lunar year so people like selling these everywhere and they're bringing them into places like this so I think this might be a temple in here how do we get in I've been in the country for less than 12 hours and one thing that I've already noticed is that the Chinese people are very respectful a lot of like civil order here it's nice things actually work the streets are clean the people are kind and you know compared to other countries especially countries with such a large population just works it's nice so all the people here are selling like the offerings you can get the incense like oil these are things that I saw on the other side people are holding these up I'm not exactly sure what they are hello hello hello what is this what is it English English okay all right let's go let's speak to this guy what is this what is it oh what is this is this a translator let's see what this is this is the trans shipment windmill this is trans shipment windmill the whole family is safe and good every year and everything is going on step by step this transfer windmill is what you bring home ah what about in here burn incense and wor okay okay how much see how much this 3 this 38 and that 28 okay I traveled the world for 6 years guys and I've never come across real translator so here in China everything is an online payment so luckily I have my revolute card that is is able to make all these payments whil I'm traveling the world so this is incense yeah oh wow okay okay thank you very much thank you basically these things guys when the wind comes it blows all the windmills meow how are you are you good people are super friendly here what is your name thank you thank you what is your name uh I hope you have a good time thank you thank you hey people are nice here guys it's super busy in the temple here but I found an area in the corner to quickly talk about today's sponsor revolute you know guys one of the most useful things when traveling to different countries is having revolute if you didn't know revolute is a financial app that lets you manage all aspects of your money in one place and comes with a range of everyday spending features and travel benefits revolute also comes with a debit card which is super handy especially here in China a place where they don't really use much cash and communicating with locals can be extremely difficult all you need to do is add your card to your phone and when you make a purchase your money will be automatically converted into the currency you need making it so easy to spend overseas without the hassle plus their exchange fees are much lower than some of the bigger Banks which makes a big difference when you're traveling but you know when you travel you can't rely on technology all the time sometimes you still need cash that's why with revolute you can get your own car delivered to your home which you can use to withdraw cash from anywhere in the world and revolute won't charge any withdrawal fee now I know a lot of you are anxious about using your card and worried about getting stolen and I totally understand as a full-time traveler I've been in so many sketchy situations where my only option was to pay with a card and I wouldn't have felt great about it either if it wasn't for revolute thanks to their single use cards I can generate a virtual card that is valid for just one transaction all right guys I'm at the temple and I want to show you how quick it is to create a onetime use card here at revolute so I'm on the app I click disposable get card for free and then just like that we have a single-use card to be used so that no one could steal our details so even if my details were stolen they'd be completely useless to them after that one transaction if you're interested guys you can download revolute using the link in the description or scan in the QR code on the screen and you get $40 after your first purchase hello helloow meow so here we are guys celebrating the Chinese New Year the year of the snake we're in the temple the wind is propelling my little propellers guys and hers basically people are lighting these incense they're coming into the front of this area and they're taking a moment to pray lots of people here doing this in their own different way this is cool look where we are right now guys in the middle of China with my little windmills this is sick so this is where you can burn your incense guys all right we have our hands kind of free guys let's see if we can fit some of these in I think we just got way too many come on oh thank you all right let's see well they take their time eh there we [Music] go I feel like we might cause a fire here are these burning now nice we did it guys let's go pay our respects we're on fire we're on fire oh no disaster we're on fire we're on fire we're on fire oh my God emergency EXC sorry you have to put it in here

carvings all that kind of stuff it really is amazing and next to it you have ginormous skyscrapers and big malls I want to be respectful but this thing is got to be the biggest uh inconvenience right

I've noticed in the past 12 hours in China less than 12 hours is the abundance of electric vehicles guys everyone is on little scooters and they Park them here obviously this is one of the main areas for today's Adventures where everyone is driving like electric vehicles or little like bikes so all these hello hello how are you how are you good good very good yeah so people Park them here people are riding them through the streets but it is crazy and with that comes extremely quiet levels of traffic apart from that horn that's honking in the distance the streets are so quiet you can't really hear anything Ubers or DD they use here are extremely cheap like a few dolls to go like 5 km which is crazy just just a peaceful area people are going to think the CCP are paying me to say this but

ever caught in existence due to the gridlock we're on foot was literally faster to walk to where we're going which is the firework place in 10 minutes supposedly the fireworks set off and we'll be able to celebrate the new year I think everyone else has a similar idea we're down near like the Waterfront Bay Area there's cars that is not moving and everyone's walking as well I'm honestly surprised at the amount of international brands that are here in China 7-Eleven we've seen an abundance of Starbucks McDonald's KFC Domino's Hungary Jack even not hungry Jack Burger King Hungary Jack is the Australian version of Burger King but I finally reached the meeting point of everybody in China wow so what's going to happen I can't believe actually made it in time literally 5 minutes till 8:00 and I think that's when the fireworks happen are you excited to see the fireworks hello [Music] say it's going to be fire the other thing that I forgot to mention is that there is a drone show as well as the fireworks so I can actually see a few drones flushing green and red up there oh there's the drones guys and The Crowd Goes mild too bad we can't see anything oh I take it back I take it back these are actually sick fireworks they don't just explode once or twice they go into like a billion bits off them little like gold speckles W coming down to the last minute also guys this lady is

bamboo it is 8:00 a.m. in the morning [Applause] [Music] [Applause] okay honestly I didn't film that much of myself talking this day because it was so hot and I actually wore KN highp boots which I heavily regretted but if you ever travel to chendu you have to go see the giant pandas I learned that you should go early because they say a lot of the pandas are awake earlier and tend to sleep later during the day also the park is so big so definitely plan for it to be a whole day [Music] activity we are going to go see the red [Music] panda oh guys I'm going to get one of these and I really want this one or this one I'm going to try to guess which so me and my sister are just going to go to the mall across the street and just shop a little bit take a look cuz we didn't really get to explore the mall that much and they have some really cool stores [Music] [Music] [Music] we are at d l which is a old Street in Chu at night apparently there's a lot of really pretty lights and lanterns but yeah we're almost there we just took the bus here it was pretty [Music] fast this street is so so cute it's definitely more on the touristy side so the prices are just like a little bit higher but

for the rides, you have to go down one floor and cross the street to the pick up area this is the taxi area
and this is the grab area all the taxi tickets are now automated our taxi driver didn't have change
so ralph had to go get some very bangkok situation this tiny alleyway leads to our hotel and there's a little welcoming committee our first time at this boutique hotel here's our bangkok hotel tour when you enter, there's a little sink i love the space
there's a giant balcony area and this is the bathroom okay babe, you can come in the balcony area is really unique sort of like being in an old thai shophouse when do we eat though? just freshened up and now we're ready to go out and explore bangkok
one of our favorite cities can't wait to eat, can't wait to drink  can't wait to shop a little bit they gave us a little welcome snack
which is a little cashew bunny cookie which i will eat because i am super hungry such a beautifully designed space i love how open and green this space is usually it's a cafe but today when we checked in, it's actually closed walking to dinner this is ralph's favorite restaurant for northern thai food lemongrass cheers southern thai fried rice with pork cracklings wish you could taste how good this green curry chicken is lemongrass pork shoulder, deep fried shrimp omelette thai style green chicken curry with roti the omelette is so simple 
but it's always one of the most delicious bites beautifully fried pork shoulder a great green curry so early in our trip time to take the bts train to silom bangkok tip: take the train to skip the traffic heading to centralworld to catch a coffee festival thailand has some of the best coffee in the world nana coffee is one of our favorite cafes in ari this is wild
what does mozart got to do with coffee? sam's favorite beans: rum caramel took home the moonstone blend roots staff is always friendly roots everyday cup
limited edition only at this event so creative with their coffee packaging is it good for pour over or an espresso machine? it's more of a dark roast nice selection of espresso mugs drip bags are a great way to taste test different cafes met a fellow filipino who roasts coffee beans on the spot i have honey processed that i can roast for you i'm roasting right now, passionfruit processed fresh beans from doi saket in chiang mai they use the passion fruit fermentation to remove the skin during the first 2 days of fermentation after that they will dry it under the sun for another 2 weeks to get this vibrant, floral, fruity and very easy to drink, juicy coffee this aroma coming from the roasted beans is exactly what you would get for 100 grams it's only 200 baht but since you're filipino...  interesting notes of apple tart, lychee, pineapple lemon lemon fermentation coffee they use the lemons to remove the skin during fermentation these beans with pineapple lemon notes 
were the best we bought on this trip air roasting means there's no contact with the metal
producing a cleaner, brighter flavor way too much coffee tasting for late night shopping for sam's favorite shoes ending the night with this floral mango shake now to find a ride home  it's tuktuk time surprised the tuktuk took a shortcut through the mall parking lot lol what do you think of our first night in bangkok? itinerary of my dream green curry, coffee tasting, mango juice  and a little shopping a peaceful end to our first day in bangkok finally, a new pair of keens
to replace my beat up ones these are so comfy i've been wearing them for 2 years now skirt from apara in manila and just got these new keen shoes love that you can see all the neighborhood 
cats from here  what's your bangkok fit today? secondhand dickies top from hanoi
pants from indonesia, slippers from fukuoka beautiful details in our balcony we loved waking up to this in the morning there was a gallery on the second floor moo deng painting
already sold the cafe is open today different beans at this cafe dirty coffee for sam coconut coffee first nam hom in coffee form strips of coconut meat there are a few small businesses in this complex will come back here for lunch another day it's their breakfast time too time to walk around the neighborhood, 
just like this thai cat always amazed by the variety of thai street food people drive by on bikes to pick up fried snacks locals grab packed food on the way to work mu ping (pork skewers) breakfast so good, freshly grilled - chicken or pork? / - pork aroi! 
(delicious) traditional thai breakfast: 
patongo (fried dough) with soy milk i took her photo coconut milk pancakes some major smoke out here always our drink of choice in thailand finally got our coconut juice which i've been pining for sobrang sarap 
(very good) oh, our first dog boop 10 baht (0.30 USD) passionfruit + orange we wanted to have hainanese chicken here but the line was too long we sat down at this shop instead crispy chicken rice one of our first vlogs featured this cafe it's been a two years since we've been back crazy menu filled with super cold secret 
milk or super cold fresh milk the staff's personal favorite is a medium roast with jasmine notes very good medium roast
good chocolate milk i think it's worth the wait was expecting it to be crazy, but 
there's actually a lot of spots if you walk as much as we do,
 you'll want a thai massage don't know what ralph was saying here lol highly recommend the foot massage here excited to try this michelin bib gourmand fried noodles we ordered fried noodles with chicken and egg they allowed ralph to film the kitchen that's a good looking bowl of noodles a different kind of noodle crispy fried noodles with chicken and a runny egg it is crispy
you gotta hear it * guay tiew ASMR * what is this
it's like a scallion pancake that chewy pull check out the runny egg crispy, moist the noodles have a crisp outer coating the inside is super soft and chewy
a nice combo a nice combo we recommend this place if you want a trip down memory lane very interesting selection of vintage thai records it's very cold in here to preserve the vinyl  they probably have vinyl dj events here nice to hang with the owner
who played his favorite deep cuts original thai music is a thai song  covered by a hong kong band called grashopper he came here looking for thai songs showing us his japanese city pop collection this is familiar you hayami who is now an nhk reporter chinatown festivities are underway does anybody recognize this thai celebrity? more chinatown sights great view at this cafe this cafe has a cool little library and shop section didn't realize it at the time,
but sam ended up buying from this thai brand in manila mulberry espresso and iced chocolate apparently this area is called song wat it's one of the steepest stairs i've ever seen thai cats have such pretty colors we couldn't pass up this mango sticky rice sundae even the gelato is made of nam dok mai mango it's too late to have coffee
but this cafe was too cool not to check out great curation of local homeware chinatown-inspired pastries some very interesting old cars on display we also came across this cat shelter the last time we were in talad noi this lady rescues injured and abused stray cats all by herself if you pass by the popular talad noi area, you can drop donations for her at: 1010 Soi Wanit 2, Talat Noi this popular shop was already sold out of their famous curry puffs even if the curry puffs were sold out,
the  owner gave us free pastries to try it's a renowned place for curry puffs we got the last flavor, which is the sweet bean  she gave it for free thai people are so nice nice, crispy, flaky dough
and a very light, sweet potato center is this you in the photo? read about this crab fried rice stall online we're here in talad noi at night to try this crab fried rice street stall which opens at 6pm this friendly lady explained there was a vegetarian festival that week so this particular stall wasn't selling its usual crab dishes just our luck!
at least we met some friendly locals our new friend told us to try this stall next time  it has ginger and gingko and then put this brown sugar but this one is a different brown sugar from this one it's a chinese brown sugar I thought these were joies since our plans didn't work out,
we ended up back at our hotel where there was a branch of an old favorite this shop features fresh local seafood delivered straight from koh lanta grilled grouper fish salad louisiana-style grilled squid painted sweet lips fish and chips the seafood quality is always amazing in thailand a delicious end to a long day in bangkok good night! thanks for watching",1,The video transcript is a travel vlog focusing on exploring Bangkok

ever I love it this is what I'm going into there's always people in there I assume it's Scandinavian based off of uh some of the signage they got so I'm [Music] excited wow absolutely sunning weather I just took so many pictures anyway something I think about that street like Marone High Street is that it has a Lulu Lemon it has an all birds but somehow it still doesn't feel like a really touristy street it's like very Tastefully done even though it has some of those you know typical shops that you see in the very gentrified areas I don't know they're doing something right here we go Che if I check on Lauren she looks amazing as always Hey Taylor what time is it oh gosh I don't know I wish I had a [Music] CLA needless to say Lauren and I are in Westminster today I remember when we said everything will happen I think you would never fail we would never die want I forget myself again so that everything can happen the wee bit windy but uh pretty cool in the London I see it find the between the and the platform we're here in Camden and we're going to go to Camden Market where there's a ton of food options apparently but how cool it kind of looks like Pella road but kind of different just colorful you know Lauren maybe we should get some you actually look good in those you're basically already last chasing myself take me Lauren for showing this to me I love it yeah I haven't even eaten yet I said I just love the vibe all right I'm getting this because it just seems like the authentic thing to do your Li is cold yeah can I do a little bit of both please thank you

the shopping area I got this scarf because I'm so obsessed with Lauren's that you've already seen in a bunch of this footage so I got this and a couple other things Lauren also got some fun stuff we did I'm incredibly proud of Taylor yeah she got stuff not black like it's really impressive Camden Market if you come to London highly recommend slay it's a sleigh another part of Camden Market it goes on way further than I thought next is Dutch Pancake they're so cute and Lauren and I are sharing 10 of the Little Dutch pancakes he's little baby all right nice vlogging skills Taylor really showed what it looked like and how I enjoyed it as well we inhale it was so good [Music] Moren and I are back out outfit changed a little bit Chang scarf I just changed it scarf oh pretty anyway we're

bringing some home to friends as well to me do you want a little a quick look at what I got yes very quickly okay raspberry and milk flavored foam sweets Percy Pig the piglets these are small mini versions red and black gums cuz I just love gummies Percy Pig The Originals two Cookie Dough Bites this one is milk chocolate with honeycomb and then this one is milk chocolate mini whips that's marshmallow inside could not be happier with my [Music] selection thank you for showing me this we haven't even eaten yet and I'm so excited oh my God pull up some bad boys with a [Music] dessert all right here we are in the basement this is the floor below where we were and there's just it's like a big wine shop and there's a a Distillery and some sushi it is so cool yeah probably sacriligious like we said but uh you know fun this isn't like Fame enthusiasm for the video either I actually think this is so sick okay and now we're on the upstairs Terrace where there's even more seating it's so cool but it's not like overcrowded how is it not so crowded up here [Music] now another day another sunny day anyway this is one of the things I got yesterday it's a bunch of old car heart jackets upcycled and then patched together which I think is pretty cool [Music] but when I turn the lights off Laur and I are back together once again we've kind of been doing a couple of our mornings where I go get my coffee and Lauren does a run or a workout I'm waiting till I'm back in New York now we're going to a place that Lauren says apparently is all over social media as like a what would you call it a hot spot in London I didn't know that you will immediately recognize the bathroom oh really can't wait to see anyway so we're going there you'll see it in about 3 2 1 here we are at sketch London's hottest tea place I hate [Music] you got a chair of hair this place is I think supposed to like trigger your senses oh so that's why it's so weird Oh indeed and it is so we got here 10 minutes early and he just said take a look around there are crystal toilets that are only available before 11 so it's good that we got here early who there she [Music] is you so much so I'm getting Taylor to try white tea which is not a very competent it's kind of like black tea but it's like process slightly different still very strong and caffeinated yeah I I think you'll like [Music] it orang this is really cool oh my God wa [Music] out and about now Lauren had to run to a meeting so I'm just going to Gallant around myself going to walk over to Covent Garden apparently there's a couple really cool fun things to see there so let's do it so lucky with the weather again we're actually going back there tonight for dinner so I'm not going to do it even though I know it's supposed to be cool we're going to c garden I think it's is this way I'm just kind of kind of figuring it [Music] out Lauren told me to come to Neil's yard it's so cute it's this little side street off of Neil Street it's kind of like a back alley with a bunch of little shops and bars so cute I love stuff like this Lauren has the best recommendation is for real what sup vlog back out and about Lauren and I are going to deu d one of the most popular Indian restaurants here woo and it's like has a little bit of a modern British twist modern twist [Music] all right I feel like I've just filmed all of London at this point but that's cuz we' be doing so much lot too there's too much to see oh my God if you guys know how I feel about oh my God I love him let's go play with him [Music] [Applause] Lauren and I are here at Burrow Market yes we are another iconic iconic Market okay check this out yeah we're underneath like a train like all the trains there's one very specific thing we're going to

like this. We're just trying to find the snake   charmers with the Cobra. We're in Morocco Africa. 
Holy smokes they had like full AK-47s John. We've   just escaped from the square we just had the 
most craziest experience. So let's rewind to the   beginning. We're in Morocco in the top corner of 
Africa for the next 7 days and this is our planned   route with Fez, the Sahara Desert and Marrakesh 
top of our list. Today we're catching a train to   Marrakesh and a little later in the episode we're 
hiring a car and we're driving ourselves out into   the Sahara desert, with the Atlas Mountains and 
famous movie sets on rout. This is where like the   Gladiator, Game of Thrones was filmed. But first 
I have to fool you in on Marrakesh our first stock   it's surrounded by this huge historic wall but 
we're going inside, in there to check out its   Labyrinth markets, its opulent palaces and we're 
going to try to get lost. There are no cars in   here, just donkeys and carts and the markets go 
on and on. So join us as we explore the streets   of Marrakesh. We'll show you the scams. I had 
$20 my hand. The sights and our favorite things   to do within these red walls made from clay 
and chalk that give it its name the Red City. John's got the bags. How are you? As part of day 
one we are catching the train to Marrakesh. We   made it with is 6 minutes to spare. Kristina 
would say that's 6 minutes too early. If you've   just joined us this is our 47th country together. 
So John's an airline pilot so we get access to   massively discounted fares, and for the past 
2 years we've been traveling and sailing the   world as much as we can when he's not working, 
and we've been documenting our adventures here   on YouTube. In our last episode we flew into 
Morocco and landed in Casablanca and we've   spent the last 24 hours here exploring the city 
and adjusting to the culture. It's a developing   country that's intrigued us for years as 
it's so close to Europe. It's literally   located directly across the Strait of Gibraltar 
from Spain. Today we're catching a train though   to Marrakesh. It's Morocco's most visited city 
and we've scored first class train tickets for   a steal. So we thought. We are currently 
on a train, it is a 3 hour train ride,   it's $30 each. I'm currently walking to the 
bathroom. It is so noisy in here. We're in first class. My gosh. There no running water out of 
the bathroom sink, super basic bathroom. This   was our cabin it seated six people and the whole 
Carriage was just about full. It's so packed,   I'm embarrassed to talk. Damn it is hot there's 
no air-conditioning. Oh my God let me see your   cheeks. So red! One thing we did have on board 
though was the internet, we purchased an esim   on our phones before jumping on board so we 
could book tonight's accommodation. On the way,   we locked in our schedule, found an Airbnb and 
we soaked in the scenery as we got closer to   Marrakesh, but look at this view. John and I are 
traveling around Morocco for the next week. Wow.   And in a few days we're actually going to be out 
there in the Sahara Desert. This is the first time   that we're seeing desert out the window. Before 
the red desert transformed into red buildings.   We've arrived in Marrakesh. It's very tropical 
isn't it? Look at all the palm trees. we've heard   pickpocketing is pretty common here, especially 
in crowded areas. The bag is officially going on   the front now. I'm so glad to be out of the heat 
though it was hot in there. So hot. We paid for   first class but the air-con wasn't working. 
It already looks much nicer than Casablanca.   Yeah. First impressions? Well it's modern and 
security is beefed up with police presence. Oh   Wow. That's so crazy oh my gosh holy smokes they 
had like full AK-47s John. What this is so sick,   look at this. I always find it so weird like 
you're in this totally different country,   totally different culture, but there's always a 
KFC in a McDonald's and it's so jarring don't you   think? Yeah. We chose an Airbnb in the district of 
Guliz, because it's in between the train station   and the main Medina. So that's the wall historic 
district with narrow streets and where all the   action is. Now the action actually started almost 
a thousand years ago here when Marrakesh was once   an Imperial City, the center of an Empire. This 
morning we are on our way to Marrakesh's Medina.   It's arguably the most famous in whole of Morocco 
and it's a UNESCO world heritage site a maze like   district with souks galore. So this is the plan. 
First we're going to walk through all the souks,   we'll then accidentally run into the incredible 
1112 tea house. Wow thank you and then we'll   head to the famous Square. So this is where we're 
going to have to have our wits about us cuz this   is where the cobras and the street performers 
are. Oh my gosh, you can see them. Oh wow but   first we need to walk through the city walls and 
as we enter it instantly becomes of photographers   paradise. John's capturing everyday life on the 
street through his lens, and I'm using my eim data   online looking up the average salary here. The 
minimum wage is roughly $2 US an hour and those   working in the public sector make around $350 US 
a month. These guys they man the Royal Palace. Big   scary guys. Oh my gosh. Next thing was to ask them 
if we can hold their gun. We just went past John   said go and ask him for a photo oh really and 
they said yes! Anyway they wanted us to send a   photo of them, on WhatsApp, to them which is so 
lovely. I'll have to send it off straight away.   How beautiful is that? Yeah very cool, it's rare a 
lot of military people don't want to be filmed so.   To show our appreciation we sent the photos to our 
phone and then we messaged them to the officers   straight away which brings me to the sponsor of 
this episode, Saily. An esim provider that lets us   have data in over 180 countries and regions. So if 
you're a traveler like me you know how important   it is to have a working phone, to stay safe. 
I'm so glad we have a navigator and connected   to family and the world. I just asked GP one are 
the top things to do. But roaming costs are really   expensive and finding local SIM cards and relying 
on public Wi-Fi is sketchy. So Saily is a great   solution that keeps us connected everywhere we 
go and is super easy to use. It just takes a few   minutes to set up and activate and with a working 
phone we can book an Uber, find great restaurants,   post on social media and text our friends. And the 
best part you don't have to install a new SIM for   each country. Once your Saily esim is installed 
you can top it up with any data plan. Get an   exclusive 15% discount on Saily esim data plans

of the Medina searching for the snake Charmers. Oh   my gosh this is so crazy going to go over here for 
a second it's sort of in the heart of Marrakesh. This is a really tourist area where they have all 
the market. There are no cars in here but there is   the occasional motorbike and Donkey. So it feels 
like we're stepping back in time, as shop owners   and couriers cart around Goods the old fashioned 
way. Are you okay? Do you want to come closer this   way? Oh. Through these narrow streets, as stray 
cats duck and weave past our feet. It is all happening. There's arts and crafts. 
jewellery and rugs pommy Granite juice. You can even get taps John. What really 
stood out to us was just how much manual labor   goes into making things here. People spending 
hours crafting items that would only sell for a   few dollars something we're not really used to 
back home in Australia, where most things are   made by machines or imported. This is one for the 
senses. As we walked past rows of leather goods,   bags and belts, I want to ask if one of 
them can make another hole in my belt,   we found this man who was happy to help. Perfect. 
That was so nice he just made a hole in my belt   for free and he didn't even want to take my $10 
that I was giving him. Which is $1.50. Everything   here goes on and on and on. But of all the 
hundreds of colorful stalls that we walked   by there was just one that caught our eye. Pastry 
Belkabir. We were so tempted to buy something from   this man. What do you recommend? We've never 
tried this before. What is the most popular? Almond. Yes. Coconut oh yeah Coconut's good. The 
hospitality in Morocco has has been amazing and   our guard is coming down. That's good thank 
you thank you. What is your name? This is   Hajj Belkabir and his family business has been 
here for over 60 years. That's you hey? Yeah   good looking. The people we've met so far seem 
friendly but we're yet to see the Market Square,   that's where we're about to be scammed. 
But first... nice to meet you, thank you, It's like dripping in Sugar. Try this one okay 
almond sesame seeds. This one? Crunchy fillo   pastry. Like a samosa. Coconut coconut oh that's 
good. God knows how old these are. okay Carry On?   No I want to try some more oh that's a big bite. 
Hang one more, oh my gosh I've never known you to   eat so much. I think this is the famous one, the 
horn shaped. It looks like a dumpling. You've got   to try it first. Okay. Marzipan. No, I don't want 
anymore. I've got a headache. Don't mind if I do.   We've been getting lost exploring the souks on our 
way to Jemaa el-Fnaa square but then we stumble   upon this Tea House, unrecognizable and completely 
hidden from the street. And you wouldn't know it's   there from the outside of the building other than 
the signage, it's just a rended wall. A lady in   dress enticed us to enter and have a look inside 
and what turned out to be a tropical transformed   Riad. It completely blew us away. Gosh this is 
just a Beau beautiful place. It's away from all   the hustle and bustle. Just through here? Okay 
thank you so much. So we're inside this beautiful   Tea House called 1112 and the family who has 
restored this beautiful property has more than 100   throughout Marrakesh and Fez, that's part of their 
mission to preserve the history and the culture of   Morocco. We've just ordered some beautiful 
teas and coffees and a couple of desserts. Beautiful thank you. Gosh this looks so delicious. 
I'm so excited for this I got the rose petal tea,   a fresh clean green tea, with a rose infusion. 
It's beautiful and this dessert here uh has   honey almonds and cinnamon, and this is what they 
actually eat during Ramadan to give them energy,   so what it's packed with goodness. Let me 
tell you what did you get? I got what is   known as coffee. Tastes like coffee. 
The coffee break was needed. You know   walking around this quiet Sanctuary made 
me realize the Medina is pretty intense.   The Sounds the Souk sellers all inviting you 
into their shops and so after our afternoon   snack and then randomly bumping into the 
owner while trying to film this shot,   he gave us an impromptu tour and then we're ready 
to hit the streets once more. Thank You. Bye. Wow that was the most amazing experience 
and tour and to get that local authentic   experience from the owner, the owner's son. 
John this is what they told us. They explained   how a traditional Moroccan house with a 
central Garden or Courtyard like this,   is called a Riad. The word Riad means Garden in 
Arabic, and you'll find that many of these once   family homes have been restored and converted into 
boutique hotels. That was cool ha? He spent like   an hour with us, that was a good hour explaining 
not just tea but whole culture Morocco culture.   Wow that beats any Museum that we've ever been to, 
any guided tour. Should we go to the main Square?   Yeah let's do it. The famous main Square Jemaa 
el-Fnaa, is just a short 10-minute walkway. So   John and I have just made it into the heart. As 
soon as we arrive we see food stores juice bars   but we've been warned about this place. Watch out. 
You going to get something? Got to be careful not   to film everyone here supposedly get in trouble 
they want money. Our YouTube Friends Vicki and   Adam documented their extortion experience at a 
henna stand. You hoping this is free? Just babe   get your pockets ready. They took Vicki's hand 
and started working before negotiating a price   making things awkward later. How much together 
excuse me excuse me give me 700. The artist wanted   700 that's $70 that's equivalent to about a week's 
wage here. Turns out the Cobra stand had a similar   tactic with us. Vendors are selling juices and 
we're just trying to find the snake charmer with   the Cobra and you can hear that noise that's them 
putting the snake into a trance right? Oh my gosh,   you can see them. Oh wow. Can you see the 
cobra on the floor? Wow, this is so crazy. So let me talk you through what's happening 
we're still a distance away but I've made eye   contact and I'm aware that they're busking 
and so I take some money out of my bag. I   take out a 20 which is about $2, and I clearly 
have it in my hand so they can see I'm about   to put money in their hat or contribute 
in some way. This is really the only way   that I'll be able to film for this video 
but it's at this point the bloke takes my [Music] phone. While another directs 
us to come in front of the snakes. He   then asks for John's camera and at the 
same time puts a snake around his neck.   It happened all really quickly 
and it was all a bit awkward   all while I still had my 20 in my hand. Then we 
were hit in exactly the same way as Vicki and Adam were. Okay so we've just escaped from the 
square, we just had the most craziest experience,   um we were obviously just trying to show you 
guys the snake charming um because it's a real   like Street performance is a real popular thing 
in the Square. Snake charming in Morocco has a   long history dating back centuries we're talking 
at least 500 years. We just wanted to get a shot   of the snake performance to show you guys and then 
they put a snake around me um they took my phone   um and then they lured John to come over as well 
they took the big camera. So I definitely wasn't   wanting to be part of that experience but happened 
really quickly so I guess if you're interested to   see what it looks like but you don't want to 
do it, I hope we took one for the team there   because we definitely weren't expecting that to 
unfold. Okay that was crazy. I had the $20 in my   hand just so I could feel what was happening. 
I had $20 in my hand he knew that I was only   going to pay that. They really pressured us. They 
wanted 200. But we just told them we didn't have   enough to pay them what they wanted and I guess 
that was an experience in itself. How I wish we   had met Vicki and Adam before this experience so 
they could have given us the heads up sooner. You   see we actually meet them in a couple of days 
time at a luxury camp in the Sahara Desert.   They actually rescued us from our tent. Hello 
could you help us please I think the door's locked. Speaking of which all 
night we've been trying to work   out where we're going to stay in 
the desert sand dunes. Oh my God   it is an absolute headache. Oh look at 
this Cat. Is this going to be a great shot? But we have finally booked something and I'm 
so excited to show you where we've booked. Before   we dive into the adventure let me quickly show you 
our Air B&B here in Marrakesh. So we paid $100 for   the night. The apartment had a washing machine 
and the bedroom even had a projector although   we didn't use it because we were so busy booking 
our luxury Sahara Desert Camp. Look at this. We've   decided to skip booking through an agency and 
instead we've decided to rent our own car and   drive 9 hours towards the desert. We'll leave in 
the morning and along the way we'll stop at Aït   Benhaddou which is a preserved fortified Village 
made made from clay. And the site where tons of   huge Hollywood Blockbusters have been filmed. They 
make it into like a movie set. This is where like   the Gladiator, Game of Thrones was filmed. Then 
we'll continue East taking in the real Morocco,   the Atlas Mountains and Views like this. 600 km 
or 350 Mi later we finally reach the Sahara. We   have made it into the Sahara in Morocco but it has 
been a mission to get here. And it all starts here   in Marrakesh, where John and I are about to head 
into the Wilds of the Moroccan Outback venturing   into the unknown just the two of us. No tour 
guide just the open road ahead. Good morning,   good morning who's ready for a delicious 
breakfast? Another delicious breakfast. In our   last episode we're in Casablanca for breakfast. 
Sounds like you're very excited. Casablanca. But   a 9-hour drive ahead today we're fueling up for a 
big day ahead. We just have to navigate the menu   first can't really understand it. Most menus are 
either in Arabic or French. English comes third.   Thank you so much this is so beautiful look 
fresh orange juice wow omelet avocado fruit   salad this one's all 70 like this is like $10 
this is like $6 us for all of this food. You   can't even get it in Bali for this price. Yeah. 
So far the start of our week long trip in Morocco   has been pretty thrilling. Casbalnca was an 
eye opener, the train ride was an experience,   and we're really excited for this road trip to 
finally begin. It's excellent thank you very much.   This is the first time that we're going to be 
driving in Morocco so it's a whole new experience   for us. New Road Rules, new everything, and it 
doesn't take long for something memorable to   happen, just a few kilometers out of Marrakesh, we 
had an interaction that will definitely stick with   us forever. So it was been an all deal getting 
underway so we've stopped off at the Moroccan   7eleven, there's all these vans on the side 
of the road on the way out of Marrakesh making   coffee so this guy's whiffing us up a little 
coffee for the road. These little kids bought   us stools to sit on. My gosh the cutest thing 
just happened these little kids came up to us. oh merci. They came up to us and we thought they 
wanted money but they just came to kiss our hands   and when we did try to give them money, 
his Dad said No. So why did they kiss our hands? That is the most sweetest thing like 
I'm actually shocked. When children kiss the   back of adults hands it's a sign of respect 
and they been bought up with good manners. It   said that it's rooted in in the Moroccan culture 
culture as a sign of respect and hospitality and   to show that the kids have been raised with good 
values and curiosity. That just hit me I just felt   guilty that I just had an assumption that they 
wanted money. Same but they were just trying to   do something nice same, and it just reminds you 
to be opened be a little bit openminded it as   easy as it is to kind of push kids away when they 
come up and ask for money or something. We've had   so many experiences overseas with parents sending 
their kids up to you to ask you for money. Sorry   Driving Manual while holding coffee is not 
a good idea. And so it wasn't long before we   were high in the Atlas Mountains. Berbers 
have lived here for thousands of years,   with villages made from mud and stone, and 
it's like we've traveled back in time. What   was that said I can't tell whether Nevada 
or India or Mexico or Nepal. Nepal. These   are the scenes and The Villages just an 
hour or two outside of Marrakesh [Music]   Wow this is amazing. So as we're 
driving through the Atlas Mountains,   we're going through town after town and there is 
just so many people around and the the communities   are thriving. When you drive through one of these 
Regional towns in the mountains there are people   everywhere, riding bikes, carrying things going 
to Markets, selling things. and they're all ages,   they're all demographics, children going 
to school. Along the way as well there's   plenty of people on the sides of the road 
selling different ornaments and tangines,   and. There are a lot of police checkpoints so and 
speed traps. And the guy that did the Handover   for the car told us to use the Waze app so 
it'll give you a little heads up where the   police are. And so far it's been spot on. It's 
been really handy. Yeah not that not that we're   speeding, but they do put out speed signs. We 
do eventually get pulled over but not just once,   twice. Is English okay? So what happened? 
apparently I over took on a solid line. But   more on that soon. We're now 3 hours outside of 
Marrakesh and we're arriving to one of the most   preserved towns in the entire country, and it 
looks like a movie set. Turns out Hollywood   directors have been scouting this area for 
years. So we've just arrived to the town of Aït   Benhaddou. We're just walking up to the highest 
point which supposedly has spectacular views. So   this is built in the earthern style john? Which 
is made from mud and straw and it's one of the   most preserved here in Morocco it was actually 
declared a UNESCO world heritage site back in the   1980s because one of the best in the country. This 
is amazing. Wow. I would have love to come here,   like it still feels like you're stepping back 
in time, but I would have love to come here 50   years ago. Oh yeah. No one would have spoke 
English. We're working our way up to the top   through these little narrow Alleyways with 
Timber, wooden roofs, and it's like almost   Hollow can you hear that? oh yeah not really but 
it's looks nice and cool. Along the way I bought   a head Scalf from this man and he offered 
to wrap it around my head in the traditional way. Like this, Perfect thank you so much thank 
you thank you. You look much better. So I yeah.   We also met a local called Muhammad, we bought a 
few hand painted cards from him saffron thank you.   So much thank you and he told us a story about 
his family home. So this was Muhammad's Father's   Place. Just here, they make it into like a movie 
set this is where like the Gladiator, Game of   Thrones just filmed. In fact not far from here we 
actually drive past some of the biggest studios in   the world, can you just go around the round about 
once? That is the studio. Atlas Studios. Look how   big it is. wow I had no idea they 
filled so many movies here [Applause] We could see hotels and pools in the distance 
and we wish that would stayed the night.   If you stayed the night and you came here first 
light in the morning this would be photographers   Paradise. I feel like I'm literally in Warner 
Brothers. Yeah amazing. And over the other side   you can see the Atlas Mountains. I just saw as 
we rounded the corner on Atlas Mountains which of   the mountains we just drove across from Marrakesh, 
there's a little bit of snow on the Peaks. Should   we go have a look. So this path forms part of the 
former Caravan route between the Sahara Desert and   Marrakesh. So when Caravans and they're not the 
Caravans that you and I know today the Caravans   were lines of camels, the locals would take gold, 
salt from the Sahara across to Marrakesh, and this   would be one of their stops their trading posts. 
At the very Peak John and I took some photos they   make part of a Morocco travel guide that's on 
my website, so if you want our full itinerary   it is completely free the link is below in the 
comments and if you're feeling generous give this   video a like or leave a comment and while you're 
doing that we're going to make our way to Todra   Gorge but before we do we are literally crossing 
the river, along with the locals on the back of   their mules, it is like going back in time. They 
carrying out their daily business amongst all   these hundreds of tourists who are visiting and 
John just mentioned before which is mind-boggling   this is UNESCO site and it's free to visit. Next 
time we come back we definitely spending more than   7 Days in Morocco. Okay next stop we spent way 
too long there my gosh damn it next time we have   to stay here John. The funniest thing is is John 
keeps saying to me we have to go we have to go   and look the photographer. Is this for real this 
time do you want to drink? So for the next 3 hours   we boosted across the country. The Landscapes 
changed as we traveled along the sealed roads,   they were at times windy, wow look at this 
place the speed limit was constantly changing,   which drove us crazy, because there were cops 
everywhere and stopping people constantly at   checkpoints. Oh my gosh John you look tired. 
round take the second exit on, But 200 km or   130 M later we reached Todra Gorge as we walk 
through this Valley you can see all the abandon   houses there the mud houses and this incredible 
Oasis right here it's just everywhere you look is incredible. This town is so quaint there's only 
a handful of restaurants and somehow we ended up   here. Okay this is the most random Place we've 
ever eaten dinner. This is chez's restaurant and   before you judge what I'm about to show you 
this is what the place ran ranks on Google,   and this is what his little Oasis looks like 
during the day. Now unfortunately we've arrived   late and we're the only guests, here so we're 
invited into the kitchen. Kristina's cooking   cooking classes. Okay there's really not not 
much open in this place and the hotel needed   a few hours notice if we going to eat there, 
so we feel really lucky to come to chez's   place. Secret herbs and spices. We found 
it on Google and it had a full five star   from other tourists who have really embraced his 
generosity and his sweet and kind heart, literally   opening up his fridge and freezer for us at 8:00 
p.m. at night when there's no electricity in town   and offering us a hearty meal. Oh my gosh look at 
all the food we have tangin, fresh fries cooking   all these chicken skewers are for us, and the most 
delicious salad. Amazing salad and two waters.   Thank you so much all right so fresh and crunchy. 
Early in the morning we woke to birds chirping in   a view that looked like a [Music] painting. Look 
at this beautiful hotel, we're staying at $65 for   the night including the most beautiful breakfast, 
coffee, tea all the condiments, Moroccan pancake.   What a spot to breakfast thank you so much thank 
you we're staying in the Sephora room and this was   the view look at that what a stunning morning 
so beautiful. Our car is just parked down on   the street. We have a big day ahead of us this 
is day four we're going to the Sahara Desert,   and we're going to be jumping on some camels. It's 
a bit of a mission to get out to this luxury Camp,   so we'll show you where we stay, how much it 
cost and if it's worth it. Having reception   out here is so important as we're pretty 
remote now. We're literally in the middle   of nowhere on a highway and in our next episode 
we're in trouble. So what happened? I overtook   on a solid line. I've left the 15% discount 
code from Saily in the description below. For   more behind the scenes join us on Instagram 
and Patron and we'll see you next week for   the ultimate desert Safari before we head to our 
next destination. Wow that is fresh! Tokyo Japan!",1,The video is a travel guide focusing on the experiences of a couple traveling through Marrakesh and other parts of Morocco. It provides a narrative of their journey

leadership [Music] me I'm going to this video is sponsored by printify for senior high school I will be taking ABM or business Strand and one of the things I want to look into during 2025 is starting a small business since I want to have an outlet to be able to practically apply what I've learned from my classes but we all know as a student we do not have the luxury of time since manufacturing products takes way too long and let alone learning how to ship them worldwide which is why today I want to show you a profitable side hust that you can start from the comfort of your own home without spending a single scent if you've been thinking about starting a small business in 2025 this is your sign to do so because here's an Etsy shop that made over half a million doll selling shirts that look just like this which is insane because anyone can do this in less than an hour and I'll show you three easy steps to start step one create a design you can do this on canva but if you're an artist like me you can draw a design for your product step two head over to a website called printify and register for a free account they have over 1,000 products you can choose from like t-shirts hoodies mugs and more by the way they have some of the best prices in the market like these sweatshirts for only $15 which are being sold for at least $30 on Etsy personally for me I'm going to be choosing this mug to add my design on it since the heart- shaped handle is so adorable step three okay now once you've made your product you can connect your printify on platforms like Tik Tok shop Etsy Shopify and Amazon whenever someone buys from you printify will do all the work and ship the product to your customer while you get to sit back and earn passively if you're interested in starting a small business for 2025 stop waiting and start doing since now is the perfect time to do so and with that being said feel free to sign up to printify for free using the link in my description thank

I'm renting this bike for the day. This is the hotel, the egg hotel that I'm staying at. But we're going to be exploring all around the island. So, it's only like 3 km wide and 3 km high, this little island of Homos. But there's tons of things to do around here. We got salt caves, all kinds of things. But once we have this bike, then uh we'll be sorted. We'll be free and we can do whatever we want. I have no idea how much uh this is going to cost. All I know is that gasoline here is like 2 cents a liter. So, uh we're good. But this is our whip for the day. I think the man is bringing over the key and then we'll be able to do what they're doing. Drive it on the beach. Let's go. And which one's good? Which one's better? We got 125 and No. No problem. Good. Good. Good. Yes. Good. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. How much is it? Uh uh $3 $3 per hour. Oh, per hour? Yes. Oh, what about one day? Oh, you speak English? Yeah, I can. Thank you so much. I just want to know how much it is for like the whole day. The whole day. It's like a $20. $20. Yeah, that's okay. Is that a good price or uh I think so. $20 for us is nothing. Yeah. Are you from Iran? Uh I'm I'm living in Los Angeles, so that's why. Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's like one kilometer Uber in LA. Yeah, exactly. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So you have to be careful when you park. So um like at any places you have to take the key and you like of course and you know here how is that? So don't give it to anyone. Yeah. Yeah. And there's gas inside or I have to fill up. So if you want you can try see how is it. But they said like everything is okay right now. But if something happen, it's my fault. But if you want, you can check or Yeah, I'll try it first. I'll just do it around here. You have a scooter maybe. When I did a bike trip across LA, I had a manual bike and it was the worst decision ever. No, they tried to bring it. So, if you want, you can wait to see the other one. We're waiting for that also. Oh, yeah. Oh, you're getting scooters. Yeah, this is way easier. Five. Yeah. Check everything. Okay. Good. Perfect. So, there's no gears, no nothing. All right. And how much is this one per day? This one is less expensive than that one. And it's like $10. Okay, perfect. So, nice to meet you. [Music] All right, we're off and racing, everybody. We got our bike. So, this is uh 10 bucks a day, like nine like 8 million real or something like that. This is like a kids toy. There is like foam on the handles and it has zero power. But when I'm vlogging like this, it's so much easier having an auto bike rather than having to change gears. And also, the the roads here are so terrible. When I was in Lao, I had a manual bike for part of the trip and the roads were so terrible. It makes it just not an enjoyable experience. But we have two options actually. Option option number one is to go that way back to the city and loop around. Eventually, we're going to end up back here. It just matters which way we go from here. So, I think we will continue this way. We're going to then end with a bite to eat in the city and then we'll bring you along for the journey. I don't know what to see. Let's just keep driving and we'll see what we uh what we come across. Salam. All right. Does this thing have a [ __ ] How do you How do you Where is the Where is it? Is it this one? No, there we go. All right, that's how we That's how we do it. So, this is our bike, guys. Look at this. How many cc is it? Like 60 cc. This is crazy. It looks pretty good though. It's going to get us around. This is the bike that I was trying to hop on the guy's uh bike with yesterday and I kept falling off the back cuz it's only one person. It's not very powerful. I don't know how you can get more than uh more than one on. But people having the time of their life out here. We are going to go that way after, of course, buying some cigarettes cuz we're in the Middle East. [Music] How are you? Are you good? Do you only have you have AC? You AC? No. What? What is that? Oh, his switch. K. Kent. Switch. How much? How much? Switch. Yeah. How much? Real power. Cash. Cash. Cash. Uh. All right. You tell me when to stop. Okay. Okay. All right. So, this is a really popular viewing point, guys, cuz we got my hotel down there and the ocean where people are getting their photos and everything. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Is this our first for the Luke de Man channel of doing a cigarette review? I think so. Why in the Middle East? Do what does the Middle Easterns do? And that is ripping six. The taste tastes like tar. So we're going to do the good old [Music] switchellini. And now it's going to be menthol. Hey, that's nice. That's nice. That's how we like it. I got to remember they drive on the Wait, left or right? Right. the right side of the road. Woo! Look how beautiful this is. Wow. What can we get up to? It maxes out at 40. Oh, wow. Oh my goodness. She's shaky. All right. Wow. Look at all the salt on the left here. Oh, this is a this is a salt cave. Look, everyone's parked up here. Should we uh should we go inside? All right, let's do it. Where do we park? I reckon just here is good. Get our key. All right, our first stop of the day, everybody, is the salt cave. It's actually pretty busy. What's so exciting about the salt cave? [Music] Excuse me. Thank you. This is going to be one of the worst tourist experiences ever. Everyone just stands in the way. [Music] All right, guys. We're in the Iranian salt cave. Quite claustrophobic. Oh, wow. Got to watch your head. Oh my god, it's [ __ ] smacked my head. Sorry. This is all salt, [Music] guys. How far does this go in? Can I go all the way through? Oh man, I'm crawling right now. I'm crawling. What's What's up ahead? Do they have dangerous animals here in Iran? Like snakes and stuff. All right, we're going in. We're going in. I don't think we're going in. All right. Can confirm. We're not going to fit down there. [Music] How are you? Thank you. Thank you. I'm just about as tall. How is it? It's so hard to navigate. All right, let's go. Look how beautiful this is, though. It's like I'm on Mars, guys. It's a different planet. Wow. It's so sad actually how polluted this island is. People just leave their trash everywhere. I've seen uh you know a fair few places around the world, but this is might be the the most polluted I've seen. Like for a remote island that's so beautiful, it's so sad. Like the abundance of bottles. And there's a bin right there as well. Literally, what is the point of putting in the bin? They probably just dump it out onto here. But let's go and uh go and explore. I need to get some food, guys. I've not eaten all day. These people are eating something delicious. Salam. Hello. How are you? Good. What do you sell? Food. What is this one? Yeah. Can I get one? How much? to pra you want. Yeah. Yeah. What? What is the name of it? Sam samosa. Oh, samosa. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. As India. Yeah. Yeah. Similar. But it looks different. You want one? Oh, wow. Yeah. Yeah. I'll have one, please. 60. 60. 60. Okay. 62 months. Perfect. Are you just here in Homos for vacation? Yes, we are here for like you from Australia. Australia. Yeah. Wow. The Iranian samosa, guys. It's like made like masala dosa. It's very different from the Indian samosa. Yeah. So, who created the samosa? India. Indian. Yeah. So, did Iran steal it from India or India stole it? From India to Europe. Ah, okay. Oh, well that's what it ends up being like. Is it good? Tasty. Very good. No, I have I have I have. Thank you. All right. Wow. It looks like a masala dosa, guys. Or like dosa cooked the same way. Oh, wow. What's that one? Is that the samosa or that's the samosa? That's kind of bread. Oh, it's a kind of bread. So, it's different. The This is the This is Oh, okay. What do you want? Yeah, I'll have this one. Yeah. Yeah. I thought we were getting this. Yeah. One. Thank you. That looks good as well, though. We have to try that at some point. Maybe later on the day. Thank you. Here's the samosa, guys. Let's go. Ketchup. Oh, ketchup. Good. Really? All right. Thank you. Okay. Salam. Oh, you going to be camera man? All right, guys. So, apparently in Iran they have samosa just like the Indian samosa. They use a ketchup on the side here. We'll get a bite without it and then we'll try it with ketchup. [Music] Oh, it's so crunchy. has aloo potato inside. Oh wow, it's good. Let's get some uh ketchup on them. Wow. Good. So good. Thank you. This is amazing. Look at like the the edges there. They're like bubbly and crunchy. Wow. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, this is actually so good. I could go back for for seconds. It's so crunchy. And you got potato in there. There's some little green things in there. Oh. This seems to be a pretty popular area to explore the mountains. So, we're coming down to my favorite part of the samosa, the corner bit. This is always the best part of any samosa around the world, the crunchy corner bit. Oh, honestly, I would go back for more. That was so good. Let's go and explore the caves. I think I left the key in the bike, guys. Oh, we've lost it. Neither are good. It's over there. That's mine, right? Please be in there. Oh, no. I've lost the key. It's a miracle that I'm even able to travel the world full time if I'm this hopeless. Where is the key? This is my room key. All right. False alarm. Yeah. I'm an actual Bron. All right. Now, let's go and explore the caves. Wait, I have the key, right? Yeah. I'm [Music] hopeless. So, I don't know what this place is, but it feels like I am on Mars right now. Look at this. Elon has done his job. Elon has brought humanity to the red planet. I think this is salt. Pretty sure you can eat this. Yeah. Oh, wow. It's salty. Wow. Let's try and climb up one of these uh big red mountains. All right. Where's the best path? Over here. Then up, I think. So, you can see here this is all salt as well. Look at that. That's all salt. Yeah. Fascinating stuff. All right. What a view we have up here, guys. These are the colors that I've never seen in my life. Just like deep dark red and purple. Then you got light colors. And this mountain, like even at my hotel on the beach, you can see this one pop out amongst the others. But this is just crazy. This is crazy. These formations are just insane. Literally, I was surprised by the natural landscapes of Afghanistan. Very large rocky mountains there, but very light in color. But here, it's like the same, but all colors. It's madness. We're back on land. That's the most good. I'm honestly thinking get another one. We're doing it. We're getting another one. Salam. You have samosa. Yeah. One. Oh, you're cooking it. Okay. So good. Delicious. I'm getting another samosa, guys. Another samosa. They're being cooked fresh. Honestly, it could be up there with cheese proper. That's saying something as well. So good. Yak samus. Yak samus. Oh, okay. Yeah, yak is one do two yak yak. They have a similar language in numbers to erdu as well as pashtu I believe when I was in Afghanistan. It was very uh similar numbers just slightly slightly changed a little bit. So just for context on the island guys this is Homo's island. We started off today uh over here at the Majara Hotel. So, we've driven down to this area, but we have not gone far. We got to go all the way around and then back. So, what else is there? The Valley of the Statues. Red Beach. Saffron Valley. Plenty of different things to check out. Salom. How are you? I'm good. I'm good. What is your I'm fine, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. What is your name? Nice to meet you. I don't know what you're saying. Here's your card. English. Australia. Australia. Australia. Australia. Australia. Where? Where from? This guy's a This guy's a ball of energy. He's a cool guy. He's a cool guy. Moscow. Wow. All right. I think we have a few samosas coming up for us, everybody. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right, we got another samosa, guys. This is honestly the best food I've had so far in Iran. It's been good, but they're big and they're crunchy. You saw me eat one like 5 minutes ago, but this is fresh. Wow. The oil is still on there and it's hot. Look how crunchy that is. There's so much filling and it tastes so good. Wow. That was so good. All right, we got to make moves, guys. I didn't realize how little we had covered so far. So, as beautiful as it is, we're going to have to uh get a move on. Oh, all right. Maybe we slow down a little bit. Wow, this is just crazy. So insane. Look how beautiful this is. This is incredible. Oh, wow. There's a lot going on down there. All right, guys. So, we got red beach here. And the drive to it is a red road. This is just the natural colors of the road, the dirt roads here. It's just crazy. But it should get even brighter as we go down. Oh my god. Before we go down, let's see what it's like from the uh the top. Wow. Look how red that is. It is so busy down there. So, out of every location here on Homo's Island, Red Beach is definitely the most popular. Oh my god, far out. This this bike is not what it's meant to be doing. So, this is Red Beach, everybody. Believe it or not, the beach is red. Now, I'm going to say something crazy. You wouldn't expect this in Iran, but Homos is known for weed, and I can smell it. I smelt it yesterday on the ferry, and I've been told multiple times that people will offer it to you here. Legitimately, it's not even just a a scam or anything. But yeah, around here, smell it extensively. But look how red this is. Wow. So, the beach is unfortunately black, but the parking area is red. Wow, that's actually crazy. It's very red. Where are you from? Iran. No. Australia. Australia. Australia. Yeah. You know Australia? Where are you from? What city? Uh, Shiraz. Oh, Shiraz. Very good place. First time ever, guys, that we got asked. Uh, someone came up to me and said, ""Where are you from?"" Maybe I'm not as Iranian as I thought. The whole trip, everyone has been speaking to me in fy. Oh, these guys are getting photo shoots done. All right. Bye-bye. H nice to meet you. So that was Red Beach. We're not going to spend too much time here. It's a bit too uh touristy. Got the market area there. There's a lady selling samosa and then all the uh you know little trinkets that you can expect at the beach. All the colored sand, all the shells, the jewelry, all that kind of stuff. It is kind of cool just being able to pull off to these random areas, get a bite to eat or see something. Let's do it. All right, finally we're back on paved roads. Thank god. This bike does not do well with the bumps. There is like zero suspension. Every time I go over rock, bang, bang, bang. It's crazy. But let's continue on with the loop. The loop. We only got one direction that we're going, guys. It is this way. And these guys, they're having fun. Hello. All right, guys. I was driving for like 10 minutes and I was like, ""Fuck, we may be getting close to doing the whole island."" And I saw someone turn off into this area. And there seems to be a few things or a few people. What is it? Like are these like the mangroves or something? The ocean's all the way out there. [Music] Ah. What is What is this place? Where are we going? All right. So, we made it. We were basically like just over halfway. Well, we at like the very north of the island now. So, this is the Har forest. Har forest. I think they're just mangroves. Oh, wow. Yeah, they're all little little crabs, guys. They all just went into the holes. Like, if you walk over this way, they all go in. Yeah, I know you guys are in there. Knock knock. Hello. Knock knock knock. Look how big their claws are. Little nippers. Hello. I see you in there. I'm going to get a good video of you, my friend. So this is where we are. We started around here and this is the main port area where there's a ton of uh little activities and restaurants to eat at. That land mass over there is mainland Iran. So that's bundus where I caught the ferry from. So like honestly I thought maybe it would take a few hours to just like get by and do everything, but we're literally like like a kilometer away from the main city. And then I don't think there's much around here. Maybe Soil Carpet Beach, but I think that is actually where my hotel is. I think my hotel is there. And then I've already explored Soil Carpet Beach. Oh, let's go into town. See what's there. Oh, here we are, guys. Back at the main part of town. The little prominard here is super nice. The water is like turquoise. There's not a whole lot going on really. Can you imagine in the summertime in the the middle of the year you know July around those months 50° plus weather or all of us lost my hat almost almost we still got it though 50° weather is like normal. It's crazy, right? Oh, look. He's got quad bike. That's all you need out here. You can go anywhere with that. But 50° plus the guy said yesterday even 55°. How do you even survive in that? It's crazy. But this is the castle. Wow. It is slowly uh losing its castleness. The bricks are falling apart. This is pretty cool. You have to go up these little ramps to then park up on the the boulevard. Yeah, that's cool. I spotted some tea over here, though. That's Let's try some of that here. Look at this. The tea The teapot, man. It's all cooking up there nicely. So, these are the options. I had these in ter Don't taste too good. Salam. How are you? Are you good? Do you sell coffee? You have coffee? Okay. It's uh take you what? 15 minutes. 15. What are the What are these ones? This one is black. Uh this is a lavender. Lavender. It's take uh 15 minutes. Can I get lavender, please? Lavender. I had lavender with Yeah, I have one. Okay. Uh can you wait? How how long? Uh 40,000 real, but it takes uh about 15 minutes. Oh, 15. That's okay. All right. How much real? four cars. Yeah, you take. Is that enough? It's okay. You can keep the change. It's fine. No change. No change. Okay. Thank you. All right. Too much, man. No. Yeah. It's okay. It's for you. All right. Thank you. Thank you. So the heat in there on the big kettle is all fired by wood. That's pretty cool. But this is a natural way of of cooking the tea. It's cooking up the hot boiling water like that. And here is the coffee that comes. That's like the coolest cup ever. That's sick. Anyway, we'll wait and then after this we can get some food. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. Yeah, it's okay. Yeah. So, you know how I said like 3 minutes ago that I had one of these in Tan? I literally saw it in my hotel and I just ate the sugar stick and thought it was a a lolly. Turns out it's sugar, but Oh, it smells lavendery. That's way too hot to drink, though. Yeah, it's just dissolving. Good. That is a lot of sugar, though. It's cooled down a bit. Let's try it out, guys. The tea here in Hoo. Oh, wow. That's so sweet. That is delicious. I don't know if it's the lavender or the abundance of sugar in there. That tastes amazing. Wow. This is so good. It's so good. But it's so hot. All right. Well, now we got the tea. Thank you. Now that we got drink in for the day, let's go find some food. See if there's anything good around here. So, I ate there last night. They have really good shawama. Oh, kitty cat, watch out. They have really good shama there. As much as I'd love to go to the same place, we just can't. What about these bread roll things? Let's try them. So, a lot of people come from Bando bus, which is like a 30-minute ferry to Hormos just for the day, just as like a day trip. You know, you come in the morning and then you uh enjoy and then you head back on the last ferry at 7:00 p.m. But what spotted my eye over here was I think falafil being put inside of a bread roll.

But it is really interesting how uh liberal this country actually is. Just the way people dress, the way people act hacked. Um, yeah. Really fascinating. Really fascinating stuff. All right. Thank you. Gotcha. All right. So, the falafel sandwich. So, this is the most popular popular food in the most. Yes. Everyone likes it. Everyone likes it. All right. All right. And I know I will as well. Different cities. Yeah. The best place is here. Okay. And our So, it's huge. It's like a foot long um sub everybody. All right, we're going to make use of my phone. So, inside we got the falafel that have been freshly cooked. We got the tomatoes, we got the pickles, and we got the lettuce. But this Oh, this is just the the perfect the perfect meal. Just incredible. And you can add all your sauces on. I will probably add ketchup in a second, but I want to try it out as is. We're going to get right through the bread roll first. So, that's not a real bite. The bread roll is done. Now, this is the real bite. Oh my god. Wow. Waffle. It's so good. Look at it in there. Wow. It's like crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. You get the warmth of it as it just came out of the the fryer there. And now we're reaching all the vegetables in there. It's amazing. Wow. Bye. Welcome to Iran. Have a good time. Thank you. Thank you. So, this is just $1. That is crazy. What we're going to do, I think this is ketchup. No, that's spicy sauce. I'm glad I checked. Is it? Oh my god. So spicy and just gross. Um, this is ketchup. It's so watery though. Which one's ketchup? Do they have ketchup? We'll have to eat it raw. Raw dog it. $1 for this. What a bargain. falafel sandwich on the streets here in Arm. Let me get one of these falafles out. Show you guys. So, what is actually in a falafel? Who knows? But it tastes good. It's got the crunchy crispy outside, the soft middle. So good. And something I've not actually commented on is the fresh white bread roll. Sometimes the bread rolls are, you know, stale or too flaky. But this is like the perfect mix between flakiness and actually softness for a full roll. So good. [Music] What a meal. So good. Yeah. It's really, really good. Yeah. Yeah. So amazing. Thanks so much for helping. You're welcome. I hope you enjoyed it. Yeah. Yeah, it was so good. Delicious. Very good. Good. No. No. Full. I pay. I pay. Real. Real four. All right.

This is the way that they show that um you matter to them. Yeah. All right. Okay. I hope you Thank you so much. Thank you. Bye. All right. Thank you. We got more fluffs, guys. Oh, I'm not complaining, though. They are good. People are so friendly out here and happy. What's up, brother? How are you? I'm good. How are you? What's your name? My name is Jay. Jay Johnson. J. Yeah. Your name? Luke. Luke. Luke. Are you from Australia? Oh my god. Yeah. Let's go, brother. Where are you from? I'm from Iran. From Homos. Yes. Gamon. I'm from Gamron. Uhhuh. And Yasham. Gam. Nice. What are you doing here? Um, very nice girls. Hey, we might get along. Okay, thank you so much. See you, brother. What a cool guy. Those falafles were so good. Just in that conversation, I inhaled them down. All right. B, what do we do? It's getting actually a bit cold out here. I will say we still got the motorbike. Should we go ride on a beach somewhere? I think so. Honestly, that falafel sandwich and the samosa that I had, some of the two best meals I've ever had traveling the world. Seriously, they were unbelievable. Unbelievably good. The falafel was so good just on its own. So delicious. Like seriously, I might have to go back down there tonight even when I finish this video and go and uh get a little midnight snack. That was unreal. Ah, it's so cold, guys. I can't believe I'm saying that. I moved down here to Horos to not say that, but I'm saying that it's so cold. Nowhere near as cold as Terano, but still not ideal. Hello. Hello. How are you? What is my job? I take photo of you. Photo. No worries. You hailed me down like I'm a I'm just going to take a lot. Yeah. Wait. Smile. Ready. One. All right. Ready. All right. Go. Come on. You got muscles. Lift them up. Lift him up. Thank you. No worries. It's okay. All right, face me. All right. Very good. Very good. Very good. Thank you. Okay. Bye-bye. Got his phone. Imagine I just drove off with the phone. Whose phone is it? Okay. All right. Bye-bye. So that's my hotel behind me. And that green one put between the two blues just on this side is is my room. 334. But you can just ride along the beach here. How cool is this? You know, yesterday's weather was so good. Beautiful. Today it's a bit windy, a bit cloudy, not as fun, but it is pretty cool being able to uh ride on the sand like this. Although it is kind of bedrock underneath. All right, we're going to go onto the sand bit. Is this a good idea? Probably not. Do I ever have good ideas? No. A sakes. Oh no. This is thick sand. I reckon we can do it though. Come on. Are we Are we really stuck here? That was anticlimactic. Come on. Oh, the back wheel is just It's like sliding out. Oh my god. All right, this is crazy. Oh, finally we're up above it. Oh, the back wheel though. It's just like it slides out. Look at that. It's so hard to control. And we are moving towards the quick sand. This sucks. This is a terrible idea. Whose idea was this? All right, we finally got it. We're moving at a snail's pace, [Music] though. All right, nice. Trust me, it's not as fun as it looks on this thing. If I had a dirt bike, that'd be fun. But this thing sucks. Oh, this is the part where I just kept sliding out off the back. No, it's so thick. I might actually be stuck here. The sand changes consistency every like 20 m. Up there it's fine, but then here I was I was getting so stuck in. And half of this is when I wasn't even sitting on it. I was like waddle pushing it. Some weird action I've created. And then where did Was it this one? I think I got up here. And even in this area, it looks rocky. The back tire was just not gripping. Oh, this is rock. I should have come up here. She's still working. Let's go. So, this place is soil carpet beach. I don't know why this is like kind of soil/ sand down there. This tide is actually gone out. It usually comes all the way up to just below this little bank here. But there's someone camping over there. My hotel is just over that way. But that's pretty much everything there is to do in Hormos, guys. There's a few salt caves, a few other things, but it's really fun just roaming around, getting one of these bikes for the day, exploring all the different parts, trying some of the food down in the city center. But tomorrow morning, I'm off early on the ferry back to Bunderos and make my way over to another remote island known as Kish. We'll see you in that video. quite a good review. Oh, they have a um do they have Google map? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you, brother. Nice to meet you. Hey guys, I will admit I I've been a little bit naughty. I have been a little bit naughty tonight. I went back for my second falafel sandwich. I didn't even vlog any of it, but it was so good. It was so good.",1,The video transcript does not contain any claims that lack credible evidence

us to the test We've had the most intense   experiences and have seen places like nowhere 
else on earth But we wanted to see whether in   a country that is famous for chaos we could also 
find some beautiful nature So we headed south to   the state of Kerala arguably the most beautiful 
state of India And over the next week we will be   exploring this region and seeing the peaceful 
side of India The side we've been dying to see   Good morning from the beautiful state of Kerala 
This is the place everyone has told us to come to   in India We are finally here and we are starting 
it off in the best way possible For the next 24   hours we are staying on our very own house boat 
on the Kerala backwaters Fourth one Fourth one   Fourth one Are you okay yeah How many boats are 
we climbing from we have to close We've just   got given a welcome drink This is fresh lemon 
Here's our captain George Captain George He   will be driving us for the next few days We are 
just unraveling the boat and we will be off any   moment now It is time to start our cruise around 
the Kerala backwaters I am so excited for this   Should we have a look up here apparently this is 
our cruising platform where we can watch from the   balcony How is this hey I've got a bed You've got 
a bed You can just fall asleep I might if I'm not   careful To be honest this is just going to be 
such a relaxing time just taking in the views   on this beautiful house boat Did I mention 
this is all private just for me and Amelia   how long have you been the captain 16 years 16 
years Wow We're in good hands Very good hands   Hi Living the life You look like you've got like 
a cocktail and you're having having a party on   this boat Yeah just me and my private boat We 
are passing so many of these house boats There   must be so many on these waters So I think right 
now we're in like a big lagoon area and then we'll   go through maybe some more like smaller narrow 
river areas It looks like no choppy waters today   No choppy waters A nice relaxing cruise We will 
be giving you guys a little tour around our house   boat but for now I'm just going to relax here 
because I I just can't move It's too comfy We   are about to have lunch whilst we've pulled in 
here for the next half an hour or so We've got   some rice some papadoms a vegetable curry beans 
cabbage fresh fish that was caught in the lakes   and what was this one like I'm not sure but 
I think it's a little bit sweet or something The fish is still Oh it's incredible The vegetable The Kerala backwaters which we are on right now 
is made up of five big lakes and they're all   conjoined using man-made canals and also natural 
rivers This whole area is actually attached to the   sea but very very far away So it's mostly all 
fresh water I wonder if there's any crocodiles   in here Like can we swim in it i don't think there 
is I would like a swim because it's so hot I think   we've both just gone really lethargic and relaxed 
though There is a nice breeze right now These rice   fields here are so green Everywhere else we've 
been in India so far has just been so brown and   average Obviously right now we're in the bigger 
canal ways but we want to head down to some of the   smaller rivers And to do that we actually need to 
get a smaller boat One has just pulled up next to   us So I think we're going to pull over and then 
transfer over to that boat Hello Hello Thank you   On to the next boat Say goodbye to our boat Bye 
boat See you later Hopefully that returns Yeah   cuz that's got all our stuff on it and our bed 
which I'm looking forward to Oh maybe we're going   down this little waterway The Kerala backwaters 
also has like this nickname called the Venice of   the East And I can kind of see why here because 
there's houses all the way along and the only way   to get around is by boat Hi Hi Hello Welcome to 
Kerala Cara Thank you Thank you Genuinely we've   probably only met a few people here but everyone's 
been so like peaceful in the way they've just   said hello Welcome Ooh coconut boat Coconut 
Maybe we get a coconut Three coconuts please You okay thank you This is the life isn't 
it this is the life Just cruising along   the river Fresh coconut in hand I feel 
like this is the most relaxed I've felt   in India This is the most relaxed I've 
felt ever It's very offputting We're   going under a bridge We got to get 
right down He said duck He said duck Good luck Oh it's not too bad That's so funny So we just saw a boat full 
of school children So rather than having a   school bus they have a school boat here 
That's so cute A school boat That is how   they just go about their lives here Here's our 
boat George is waiting for us with his big smile   Hello All beautiful Yeah Very beautiful 
Amazing So peaceful out there Thank you It is tea time And we also have ourselves 
some fried banana I thought that was like   an Indonesian thing but clearly it's a 
thing in south of India too If you're   interested in the house boat we're staying 
on I'll leave a link in the description We   booked it on Get Your Guide and so far it's 
been very good hasn't it highly recommend Looks like they've put this temporary 
like boat floating device to get that   truck across And now it looks like they're 
unraveling it over there and they're going   to hopefully let us through This does 
look like a very small gap but I know   George will have it under control He's the 
best driver in all of Kerala It looks very narrow I'm not 100% sure but maybe we're going to 
be watching the sunset here Maybe this is actually   where we're going to be camping tonight Well I say 
camping Obviously we're going to be sleeping on   this house boat Is this Do we sleep here Oh nice 
Now it's time to give you a tour around our house   boat And it's not this one It's actually this one 
Right Amelia is going to jump back on and take you   around You have to walk the plank to get back on 
Yeah Make sure you don't fall in You don't want   to do that And then through here this is where our 
Captain George sits We've got like a pirate ship   wheel thing This boat can only fit two people 
but there is so much seating We've tried to try   as many chairs as we can but we really don't need 
this many but it's very nice We got these ones And   then over here is our dining table where we had 
our lunch And there's a pineapple that I've been   eyeing up for later because fruit is so good here 
And if you follow me this way down the corridor we   have our bedroom And down at the end there is kind 
of like their quarters where they have the kitchen   and stuff And through here is our bedroom And 
it's so much cooler in here because we actually   have AC even though we're floating We only have 
it on in the evening and when they plug up to   like the hookup that's on the land at the moment 
but it's so nice because it is so hot at this time   of year And obviously this is the first time I've 
laid on this bed and you kind of sink into it It   feels like memory foam Is it not hard no Oh last 
night we slept on a train and that was rock hard   So this is lovely A little extra seat because you 
can never have enough I guess you could like lay   that out and probably have a third bed Oh that's 
probably why But you can never have enough places   to sit on this boat And then in here is the 
bathroom I don't know if it's just me but it   feels slanted Probably cuz we're on the water Yeah 
maybe there's more things on the right of the boat   than the left I think so Um which is why this door 
keeps falling But we actually have a proper shower   a sink and a toilet with a bum gun and toilet 
paper What more could you need when we booked   this we generally weren't sure Wo you really 
do sink into this bed We really weren't sure   whether we'd have like a shower Like we thought it 
might be a bucket or something cuz obviously we're   on the boat But it is so nice to have these 
luxuries in the middle of Kerala backwaters Oh this room is really swaying Is it 
swaying i think we're just at an angle   Also I kind of look blue right now 
because they've got blue light in   the sun We're going to sway our way to 
sleep and we'll see you in the morning How did you sleep on the wonky bed good 
I slept a bit wonky So every time I don't   know every time I woke up in the night I 
was like falling further into jail when I   had to climb back up to the other side of the 
bed because it was really on that much of a slump We have finally cut open the pineapple and 
I am so happy Look at that It looks incredible   Fresh pineapple She's dancing She's happy 
She's got what she's been eyeing up these   last 24 hours So good Just as we're finishing 
our breakfast unfortunately it's time we have   to head back to the harbor So let's enjoy 
this final journey along the backwaters I just saw this lady like doing the 
laundry but the way she was doing it   was like whacking it on this rock I've never 
used that technique before but maybe Amelia   should try it I might try that when I do 
my laundry next to just whack it on a rock   Maybe it's a drying method or something 
And unfortunately I think it's time that   we're going to leave our house boat but we 
still have lots more to do here in Kerala And here we are back on the land Thank 
you Lovely space Thank you so much I don't even believe this We have just checked in 
this ocean front little villa place for only $25   £20 per night and it is beautiful Like the sea is 
literally what 40 m away So this is our beautiful   little room This is just the only room they have 
here in this place But let me show you the sea   Check out this view We're literally 40 meters 
away and we are only spending $25 a night That   just blows me away Hello Anyone home hello Welcome 
to my beach house It's so nice in here We've got   a big bed We've got a seat And it's actually 
really spacious So we've been able to spread   out all of our stuff There's all my stuff on the 
floor as usual Yeah Joel likes to spread out his   clothes And we obviously have a nice bathroom It 
feels like everything's brand new in this place   and the price is just insane I can't believe it 
Are you ready for the beach always always ready   Always ready for a swim The sky is so blue and it 
just looks so nice with the sunbeds the white sand   Feel relaxed But the whole thing is like where is 
everyone there's 1.5 billion people but there's   like no one here Like look at the beach It's so 
empty We're going to try and get one of these   sunbeds Not sure how much they are but let's see 
if someone comes over if we kind of perch around   them Should we go for these ones yeah let's go 
for the ones at the end Look we've got a nice   towel Oh here comes the guy How much 1 hour 200 
Okay How many times uh maybe just 1 hour 200 Okay This is not bad What a life Got my book here 
which I haven't started because we've been so   busy in India and it's been so chaotic that I 
haven't wanted to read my book But now maybe I   can take a time to read Because we were so 
ill when we were in Goa we had no time for   like doing exactly this But this just feels so 
good You're getting your little suntan aren't   you yeah Getting my little tan on in India I've 
given up reading Giving up I think it's time we   probably go in the sea Yeah Yeah I'm going 
in I'm getting too hot Sitting there doing   nothing Ready for a swim I was ready the 
moment we sat on those benches to be fair I can't get over how warm the sea is here Like 
it is so hot Hurrying to cut my teeth I can   take what I need to get by It doesn't make 
it easy It's time we get some food There's   quite a few like beach restaurants so maybe 
we can get some local curry or maybe some   fish Should we go All righty D is so hot 
Amelia's running Help me He's literally   burning my feet Let's try this one Luave Cafe 
Probably traditional French food I assume This is a mango fish curry We weren't 
sure what it was going to be like but   honestly it's one of the best things I've 
ever eaten It tastes so good And the fish   is incredibly fresh It's almost like a 
Thai curry I'd say cuz it's quite light   but the fish is just melts in your mouth It's 
so good Right We're going to have to get this   again It's just incredible We spent the 
rest of the day relaxing at the beach   and enjoying the sunset before heading 
somewhere completely different tomorrow drag our suitcases along the sand The people 
here are just so nice They like refuse to let   us carry our bags I feel so bad cuz it's 
heavy So we are about to jump in a taxi   for about quite a while and head to Manar up 
into the mountains of Kerala I'm so excited I don't know what's going on but we just 
stopped in the road and I think they're   dressed up as Hindu gods maybe it looks like Wo 
wow so cool I don't know what it's for but it's   beautiful She's smiling I got a smile at me So 
I don't know if that was correct but it sounded   like that sword kind of thing the metal was going 
directly through the cheek and through the tongue   But for some reason they don't feel pain Maybe 
someone knows more information about this than me Munar feels a lot busier than we were expecting 
and it's kind of hard to get around I think we're   going to try and take the public bus We've 
got a written down instructions here from our   hotel manager We have just got into the town 
center of Manar and I think we've just found   the bus stop It's just in front of us here 
So we're going to take the public bus so we   can avoid all these package tours which seem to 
be sold here in Munar We are getting the bus to   Stenny and then we stop at Lockheart Nice Yeah 
Are they lucky i think this is our bus tenny This is our second Indian bus and this is 
a very local one So wish us luck through   the mountain roads Oh wow Starting to 
see some greenery outside the town of Manar That was a very relaxing bus ride here in 
India I was not expecting that I was expecting   him to like crash down the down the road 
but it was actually just a beautiful ride   But unfortunately they didn't stop when we 
wanted them to stop I don't know if they just   have to stop at specific places but we now have 
to walk 15 minutes back in the direction we came   The thing we found here in Kerala is that it's a 
lot of package tour holidays and so everyone has   like their individual drivers who take them 
to the different points especially here in   Munar So it's a lot harder to do on a budget 
especially if you're backpacking But we're   proving today that we think it is possible 
Just get the bus Just get the bus As soon   as we got out of the town of Muna it feels so 
much more peaceful again Lockhart Tea Factory There's no one at the ticket counter and I need to 
pee Upon entering the tea factory we were invited   in for a tour The facility was established in 
1879 when the British began planting the crops   The tour lasted around 30 minutes and cost 
us 300 rupees each To be honest we couldn't   really hear a lot of it because she had a mic 
on but she was talking quite quietly and it   was a big group of people We've been told that 
if we walk about a kilometer up the road that   we can actually go into the rice terraces rice 
terraces tea plantations and have a little walk   around So we want to hopefully have a little 
peaceful walk but we'll see if we can get in   We didn't feel like trying the tea there because 
they reuse all the spoons and it just seemed a   bit unhygienic So we're going to have some tea 
at this little place This guy's making us tea   right now Thank you Thank you very much Uh that's 
good It's so sweet Cheers Cheers Nice cup of tea Oh wow This is incredible So green It's like 
a yellowy green It's beautiful What kind of   amazes me is that it's so dry here at the 
moment Like everywhere is so dry especially   up in the mountains It looks so brown but then 
all these tea plantations are just so flipping   green I don't know how they do it They must 
water it So tomorrow if all goes to plan we   will try and climb the mountain up there 
Is it that one i'm pretty sure it's that   one Yeah Looks quite high up doesn't it 
yeah going to get a freshly cut pineapple So about 100 years ago the year ago 105 years ago 
105 years ago we got speaking to this lovely man   who explained Munar used to have a railway but 
a huge flood destroyed the rail and it was never   rebuilt No chili Thank you Thank you so much Look 
at that Got some very fresh pineapple This looks   amazing to me And they actually grow it around 
here as well Yeah it's actually freshly grown Thank you very much It's so good The green of 
the coconut matches like the beautiful greens   behind Feels good supporting the local 
If you ever want like a little coconut   make sure you get one because it's your way 
of helping the communities who don't always   get all the money from tourism like the 
big travel companies on these big group tours Yeah we've come into this tea plantation 
area which you can actually walk through and   it was 50 rupees each which isn't too bad 
There seems to be a few people around getting   their photo taken but not too busy 5 minutes of 
walking and I'm pretty sure we've lost everyone   else who's entered this tea plantation 
It's very peaceful around here It's lovely A lot of the tea estates here are very 
private and so you can't actually walk   on them But I definitely recommend coming 
to this spot because you can actually walk   around pretty much wherever you want around 
this area You can actually see up there there   are some people working right now Apparently 
most of the time they do the picking at like   really early in the morning because of the 
heat But maybe because it's March they can   do it in the middle of the day because 
at the moment it's only like 24 25° and   it's the middle of the day So not too hot A 
lot cooler than when we were in the Kerala   backwaters and the beach yesterday I think 
this is our bus Well we need any bus to Manar After our walk through the tea plantations 
yesterday I ended up not feeling very well   I've still got a stomach bug from Voninasi 
which was a few weeks ago But Joel is going   to do a hike now without me because I just 
can't leave the toilet You're going to have   a good time Yeah I don't think it's too far 
a hike I think it's maybe like an hour and a   half right then let's start this adventure I'm 
going to try and see if I can get tuk tuk but   do some negotiations and see what price we can 
get Otherwise I'll just take the bus cuz it's   a lot cheaper I'm going to chukundi Chuker 
Mundi Chuker Moody Yeah The the mountain go   How much uh took to 400 400 Yeah So drop off 
yeah Drop off Okay Let's go Okay Thank you Okay Yeah this one is fancy Perfect Thank you Here 
we are We have arrived at Chukamundi Now this is a   less busy track and a less busy viewpoint than 
the famous one which everyone goes to and it's   supposed to be super crowded So here we're going 
for the more hidden hidden path Yeah You're from   England You only take card yeah Only card Only 
card Wow Very modern Yeah These for me Bourbon   included in the fee Yeah Fe Oh okay Thank you That 
was quite nice 600 rupees and it does include a   guide but I was like I don't need one I'm just 
going to chat to you guys and kind of follow the   path up cuz apparently shouldn't be too difficult 
So hopefully we don't get lost Yeah we also got   some bourbon biscuits Some water included as well 
Not too bad He just told me to be careful on some   of the rocks cuz they're slippy Whilst we climb 
this mountain which takes about an hour maybe an   hour and a half We'll see how fast they do it Um 
I want to talk to you about the difference between   North India and South India because honestly 
it feels like I'm in a different country Looks   like we've got a few clouds coming in Hopefully 
it doesn't rain Let's start off with the people   The people in the south of India compared to the 
north have been so much nice so much friendlier Oh   I nearly slipped So much more honest For example 
the tuk tuk guy he offered me 400 rupees In Jaipur   for a 15-minute journey someone tried to charge 
a,000 rupees and we'd only go down to 600 rupees   Obviously I'm still paying tourist price but still 
be honest guys Woo look at this You can really   start to get a perspective of the tea plantations 
down there Something about looking down on them   just makes them look even better I think it's the 
patterns or the greenery What a beautiful view   This section is just kind of slab of rock You're 
going to have to go up Not a bad view really The   second thing which is so different is the traffic 
Like up north there's so much traffic There's so   it feels like there's a lot more people It feels 
like the billion people live up there in the north   of India But even down south even when there 
is traffic there's not much beeping It looks   as though we've got ourselves a rain cloud Does 
look pretty gray Oh wow there's actually cloud   Look there's cloud coming off the mountain 
Not sure we even have a view at the top Hello England Where are you from kerala Kerala 
whereabouts from Anar or Kochi Kochi Kochi   Oh nice Sorry Yes Hello The is the 
view clear yeah Almost Almost Maybe   It's awesome Yeah Good Awesome Thank you Okay 
Have a good trip Those lovely people said it   was clear at the top Maybe that will change 
It's not looking great though Look at this   just mist coming over I'm blowing cuz we're 
at altitude We'll be over 2,000 mters by the   time we get to the top If you are doing this 
it's quite easy to navigate You don't really   need a guide as there's little pink ribbons 
and like arrows pointing you in the right direction It's so peaceful I can literally 
hear nothing And we're still in India   The third thing I'd say which is so different 
from the north to the south is like how clean   it is Like obviously there's no rubbish here but 
even in the streets Like usually like in the north   people do just chuck plastic anywhere but here 
in the south you see it obviously but it's not as common All right This is turning into 
quite the adventurous walk just through   all the undergrowth Someone's like 
machete through I think I'm just   going to sit here for 2 minutes maybe 
three and treat myself to a bourbon biscuit That's actually really good Borborn 
biscuit Doesn't get better than this Going   back to the north and the south the fourth 
thing I definitely think is different is is   again more about the people but like Amelia 
is not getting nearly as many looks Like in   the north like some of the men were just looking 
at her like looking her up and down and it made   her feel really uncomfortable But those are the 
main kind of differences between the north and   south that we've found I'm sure there's some 
others And if you do have some leave them in   the comments Be interesting to see the difference 
what kind of difference you think as well Hello   All right Is this the top top view That's top 
view Further That was a fake little top You   know when you get to the top and you go ""Oh 
it's another next peak."" But I think this is   the genuine top just up here Finally nearly made 
it And it's closing in It's 11:24 So that will be   yeah pretty much an hour and a half with tripod 
shots and drone shots So I stopped quite a bit   There we go The peak the last little scramble 
up the top and the view is nowhere to be seen of course Hey well Chukamundi we made it You 
made it Yeah Top top The top Yeah Yeah Relax Hello These guys asked me to 
film them for a video and I   have no idea what was going on Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Nice to meet you Bye-bye What friendly 
people I have no idea what they were saying They   said something about this video Maybe they guessed 
I was a YouTuber or something but friendly smiley   happy people Little bit slippy All right 
this is the place for the borbon biscuit eating I can't tell you how 
good these are right now And I am practically back It's literally 
like a one minute walk back down here to   the road Completed it It's now half one So 
it's taken about 2 and 1/2 hours So there   you go with some relative stops Back to 
the little hut I think I'll just jump on   the bus to go back cuz it will be so cheap 
and fast Probably faster than a tuk tuk Yeah Winner winner winner winner That was so fast grabbing a bus Literally 
2-minute wait and we'll be back to Manai in no   time because these buses fly down these hills 
don't they the following day we headed back   to Kochi the main city in the state of Kerala 
Good morning from Kochi We are about to take a   ferry onto the main fort area of Kochi to have 
a little look around this city I think this is   like a big kind of inward lake but the best way 
to get to the full area is by ferry because if   you take the road apparently it takes like 
forever to get around and you get stuck in   traffic and stuff So the ferry is the best 
way and apparently it's super cheap It seems   so calm and quiet down this road I don't know if 
it's just cuz it's like 8:00 in the morning or   if this bit's just a bit calmer Fort Coochi 
this to go there to go there Okay thank you Two So that only costs six rupees each and 
they literally only sell the tickets literally   as the boat arrived which makes no sense but 
that's India for you Here we go onto the ferry We've just arrived in Port Kochi 
and we're going to try and take   a tuk tuk to the main area How much to the 
basilica basilica 40 rupees 40 rupees Okay that's good We just got an honest 
price 40 rupees to the basilica   here in Fort Coochi Honest tuk tuk 
driver I like it It's okay Thank you   We have arrived at a basilica at the cathedral 
and apparently it's like one of the most famous   churches in all of India It's pretty big as well 
I forget how like Christian it is here or Catholic   Like there's so many different religions in Kerala 
but they all seem to get on well and just like   respect each other which is so nice One thing I 
forgot to mention is here in Kerala it's actually   kind of like a communist party which kind of runs 
the state Um I'm not sure obviously it's not super   communist but there was loads of communist flags 
when we were up near Muna And yeah just something   I had no idea about before coming to India It 
definitely feels different here The streets feel   super clean and it just looks European I think it 
has Dutch British and Portuguese influence So that   is probably why But it's honestly very pretty Look 
at this Oh it's such a beautiful little cafe Wow   Oh it's the tourist information We've just seen 
Santa on the streets of Kochi Didn't fancy seeing   you there Didn't expect to see Santa going to the 
beach in the city Can someone explain this to me   stick no bills I've seen it so many places and I 
have no idea what it means but it's like all on   the walls of things It's really odd I just want 
to know what it means Here we go again But it's everywhere So we thought we'd come down to this 
beach area And this is what the beach looks like   There's a nice dog but it's just covered in 
rubbish It is just filthy Look at that It's   actually crazy It's not quite as good as the other 
beaches we went to in India unfortunately Go kind   of beat this didn't it yeah Well even the beach in 
Kerala but no not here Here we go This bit of the   beach is a little bit nicer You can see some sand 
You can see some sand Yeah Not just rubbish It's   so hot here currently in Kerala It's mid-March 
And if you are coming around the city I would   definitely recommend coming in the morning when 
the sun's a bit lower cuz by midday it's way too   hot to walk around You'll just be sweating If 
I had to guess where we were right now I would   not think of India Like look at this Such a big 
European influence here That is the end of our   time here in Kerala But we have a big announcement 
We're actually going to be making a long form   I'm talking 1 hour to two hours maybe um of our 
whole time our whole experience here in India Um   and it's going to include things which we didn't 
actually film in the videos we've already posted   Things like going to the Taj Mahal our overnight 
bus experience an overnight train experience   things which we didn't share on here on these 
other videos If you haven't already go down and   hit subscribe so you don't miss this video which I 
think is going to be very good I think I'm excited   to make a long form a longer format video Anyway 
we'll see you in that video and we'll see you soon",1,The video and transcript provided are focused on a travel experience in Kerala

using my Waverly chalk paint in the color plaster we're going to give this a nice coat of paint and this doesn't need to be perfect it's totally okay if the wood shows through now let's set that aside to dry I found these letters at Walmart and it spells out the word eat and I'm just going to tape these down onto a paintable surface so it's easier to paint them tape these down I usually use painters tape but if you don't have that around you can go ahead and use masking tape and that will work just fine let's grab our Waverly chalk paint in the color ink and I'm going to go ahead and paint the tops of these letters and around the edges as well I'm using my heat tool to dry these because I really want to make sure these are really nice and dry before we go on to our next step so I found this reusable self-adhesive stencil on Amazon and I really like the pattern on it and I've used it in a few different crafts and I want to use it on this one as well so I will put a link in my description box below so that if you wanted to look into the stencil you could now I don't want to use the stencil on the full letter itself I'm only going to use it on pieces of the letter now using my chalk paste by redesign in the color vintage lace we're going to take our squeegee and just squeegee that paint over the top of the stencil now let's just repeat this step until we have a nice design on each one of these letters [Music] and I love how bold this is turning out I just think this black and white is just a fun look together and once we have the white paint completely dry I did go back with my Waverly chalk paint in the color ink and just did a little bit of touch-ups and any spots that I thought needed a little bit of extra black so while this is drying let's go ahead and make a bow and I'm going to do triple loops on either side of this bow just to make sure it's nice and full and I'm just doing a single Loop and then grabbing it in the center and doing the same on the opposite side and once we have all of our Loops I'm going to scrunch it in the center and using a piece of pipe cleaner I'm just going to wrap that around the center and fluff my bow and next I'm just going to grab my scissors and dovetail the tails on this bow once that is complete I'm going to cut another piece of ribbon here and I'm just going to fold it into thirs and hot glue that around the pipe cleaner just to cover it up that's about 2 in in ribbon and this simple Triple Loop bow is adorable I hope that this is something that you can Master because I think this bow goes well with a lot of different crafts let's go back to our letters for our final step we're going to use some Jolene finishing wax and using a lintree cloth we'll just rub that wax over the top of the paint and now for the fun part let's put this all together we're going to put the board out that we painted at the beginning and add the letters on top and I'm using my straight edge to make sure that everything is in place where I would like them and then what you'll see me do here is I'm going to take my straight edge and I'm going to place it down kind of like a line so that way I can just take the letters and put my wood glue on the back with a little bit of hot glue and then place them back exactly where I wanted them on the board then we would just repeat this step for the other two letters until everything is glued into place now I did not move this sign for probably 2 hours cuz I wanted to make sure that wood glue really stuck onto the sign before I did my next step now for our last step we're going to reattach the original hanger that came on the sign and once we get that reattached I'm going to take some hot glue and hot glue that triple bow onto the top and here is what our sign turns out to look like I just love the details in the stencil on this and I think this is just a unique Farmhouse piece that you could put in your kitchen or dining room let me know what you guys think in the comments below I found this beautiful dish the other day when I was out thrifting with my daughter and I thought this would look amazing if we Deco posed it and added some paint so what we're going to do is start out by taking some of this silver paint that I have and this paint is from Delta cretive and it's considered a Luxe metallic silver acrylic paint and after we've flipped over this dish there's an indentation on the bottom piece of this dish and that is where we're going to paint the silver paint and to ensure full coverage with this paint you do need three or four coats so be patient and give yourself some time to do this and if you do get a little bit of paint on the dish outside of the design don't worry if it's not too dry it will clean up very nicely let's get prepped for the decopage we're going to start out with this beautiful napkin here and I got this napkin at HomeGoods and I'm just going to remove the back two layers of the napkin so we're going to flip the napkin over and we want the front side of the napkin to go on the back side of the dish and before we go too much further I want to put this on a pable Surface because this next part will get a little bit messy I'm going to grab my mod pod and this is just some regular matte mod podge and I put a tiny bit down on the dish just so that nothing moves around too much and I reposition my napkin and once I've done this I'm going to just go for it and I take my mod podge and I'm just going to paint down the napkin onto the surface of the back side of the dish and by placing this upside down it's going to show through on the other side when we flip the dish over and don't worry about the excess napkin we'll take care of that later right now just paint everything down to the bottom edge of this dish and once you are satisfied with the Mod Podge you need to let this sit do not touch it do not try to dry it just let it sit like 2 hours or overnight just let it dry until it looks almost like it's crusting over so now that it's dry let's take a quick look see at what it looks like right now as you can see this is really translucent but we're going to change that so first let's go ahead and remove any excess napkin and I'm using my zip sander for this you could use a razor blade or you could also use a regular block sander now that we have everything removed I went ahead and I grabbed my Waverly chalk paint in the color white and we're going to paint a coat of paint over the top of the napkin depending on how thick of a coat of paint you do with the white you may want to do a second coat I felt like I needed a second coat so I ended up painting a second coat on this now once this is completely dry I'm going to show you another lookie I know I probably should wait till the end but it is so cute I love how it's turning out now let's go back to our silver acrylic paint and go ahead and paint a coat of the silver Sil over the top of our white paint and for the silver paint I feel like this really needs two coats so I did do two coats of the silver now once the silver paint has completely dried I did take this outside and to seal in the silver paint we are using our Rustoleum clear enamel in mat and now that our piece is completely dry let's see what this turns out like and wow this is a stunning piece I love how it turns out I can't wait to display this to put our keys in let me know what you think in the comments below and if you're enjoying this content don't forget to hit that subscribe button [Music] [Music] so the Dollar Tree has up their game on wood boxes and this is one of their new wood boxes in their crafter Square section and I just love that it has more of a curved look on the top of the box and I'm going to use this today with some wood snowman that I had left over from my Christmas stash so once we removed our labels I'm going to flip over my wood box and using some wood glue we're going to attach each snowman to a corner of the box and once all of our pieces are attached I set this aside to dry for about 1 hour now let's move our box onto a paintable surface and I'm using some Waverly chalk paint in the color sandstone and I'm just going to give a nice coat of paint around the whole entire box and then when I flip this box over I'm only going to paint the inside Ledges of the box and leaving that square in the center without any paint now once all of that paint has completely dried I grab my Waverly chalk paint in the color plaster and we're going to paint the inside square with the plaster colored paint now for this next step I'm going to flip our box over and I'm using my straight edge and I'm going to find out what this Square inside that box measures out to be that square inside the box is 5x5 and I found this beautiful napkin at HomeGoods and I'm just going to iron out some of the creases in the napkins by placing a piece of parchment paper over the top and using my heat press next let's go ahead and flip the napkin over and we'll grab our straight edge again and I'm just going to draw out a square in a 5x5 pattern in the center of the napkin and once we have our square drawn out grab a pair of scissors and cut out your square and once your napkin is cut out go ahead and remove the back two layers of the napkin now let's go ahead and make sure that that napkin fits in the Square before we do anything else and once we've determined that it does fit I'm going to grab mod podge and I'm using the matte Mod Podge for this and we're just going to do a nice coat of mod podge over the top of the napkin and I can be a little bit messy when I'm painting my Mod Podge on so I ended up painting some of the Mod Podge just in a nice thin layer almost to the top of the rim now once our mod pod has completely dried I grab my mineral colored Waverly chalk paint and I'm using a round brush and I'm just going to do a dry brush and add a little bit of Dimension to this little tray and I'm just doing this on the outside layers of this tray once that has completely dried I'm going to grab my Waverly chalk paint in the color plaster and I'm going to do the same thing and that is it our little tray is ready to display I love how this turns out let me know what you think in the comments below for this craft we're going to transform this wood box from the Dollar Tree a staple in the Crafter Square section into a adorable wheelbarrow we're going to start out by painting our little box with some Waverly chalk paint in the color plaster and once our paint has completely dried I'm taking some Waverly chalk paint in the color ink and I'm going to just dry brush around the outside of this box and while we have our ink paint out I'm going to go ahead and paint two of my tumbling tower blocks that I got from the Dollar Tree and then I painted two square dowels that I found on Amazon and if you can't find these dowels Chopsticks or round dowels will work just the same let's set these aside to dry and go back to our wood box I have this adorable stencil that I did get on Amazon and I'll put a link for it in my description box below these work great for ornaments and all sorts of different things we're going to place this on the side of our little box and using some redesigned chalk paste in the color Iron Gate we're going to just go ahead and squeegee that over the top of our stencil and then we'll remove the stencil and I washed it and did the same thing on the other side next let's work on our wheel for our wheelbarrow I am using an ornament piece this is a wood slice and this one had a eye hook at the top so I just remove that from my ornament and I'll save that ey hook for another craft Now using our Waverly chalk paint in the color ink we'll go ahead and paint both sides of this wood [Music] slice paint has dried I grab my Waverly chalk paint in the color plaster and I'm just going to go ahead and dry brush around the outside edge of our wood slice and while we have our plaster colored paint out I want to paint two little half beads and I'm taking a piece of painters tape and I just lay that out onto my piece of cardboard and I'm just going to place those wood beads on top so that they don't move around making it a lot easier to paint and keeping my hands mess free now once all of our pieces have completely dried I'm going to put together our little wheelbarrow and I'm using wood glue and hot glue for this and we're starting out by adding our little tumbling blocks to The Backs side of this wood [Music] box now let's go ahead and make our wheel for our wheelbarrow I am using my two wood dowels and some wood glue and a little bit of hot glue and I'm starting out by just doing the first wood dowel on the wheel I'm trying to align it up right where I would like it I'm adding that hot glue to the skewer and we're just going to go ahead and place that at a slight angle and this is probably the hardest part of the whole entire craft is getting that right angle on our wheel and once you get that perfect you go ahead and do the next side the exact same way didn't have to hold this while it was drying I did use my pink clip from the Dollar Tree and I just attach that at the end of the wheel there and once that has completely dried I take my hot glue and I'm going to just hot glue my half beads to the end of that dowel and then we repeat that same step for the other bead and our little wheel base is ready to attach to our wheelbarrow and to attach our wheel base I'm just flipping our box over and we'll use some hot glue to attach our base to our box and what I love about this wheelbarrow is you can decorate it any way you'd like for whatever season so for this season for the fall I'm going to add a little bit of stuffing into the box and I'm using some black and white checkered ribbon to go around the edge of the Box just to give it a little bit more Dimension and for my final ad I'm going to take these velvet pumpkin that I got from the Dollar Tree and I'm just going to stick them inside the [Music] wheelbarrow and I just love how this wheelbarrow turned out it is amazing and I cannot wait to display this for multiple Seasons let me know in the comments below what you would display in your little wheelbarrow and if you're enjoying this content please don't forget to hit that subscribe button below it really helps my channel grow thank thank you so I was walking through the Dollar Tree and I found these wooden frames in the crafter Square section and I thought these would be perfect to make ornaments out of so that is what we're going to do here I'm starting out with one of these frames and a few popsicle sticks and these popsicle sticks are the mediumsized popsicle sticks that you can find at the Dollar Tree what I'm starting out doing here is I'm just going to cut one of the ends off and then I'm going to measure the popsicle stick to the inside of this Frame but I want about a/4 of an inch on either side so I'm going to take my straight edge here and I'll just measure that here so you guys can see that and this ends up being about 2 and 1/2 in is what I'm going to need so I'll just Mark that on my popsicle stick and then I'm able to actually get two slats out of each popsicle stick and to fill in the frame completely I needed five slots of those popsicle [Music] sticks once I had all of the popsicle sticks cut I did take my zip sander but a sanding block would work just fine and I just sanded the edges off of those sticks to cut the popsicle sticks I actually ended up using just some outdoor Clippers that I bought from the dollar tree but scissors if you have a heavyduty scissors those work good or you can score the popsicle sticks with a razor blade and once everything is prepped I took my antique wax from Waverly and I'm just going to go ahead and stain all of these [Music] pieces now once everything is stained and I did stain these on both sides I'm going to take my wood glue and just attach these pieces to the back of this Frame and let's set that aside to dry for a few minutes while that is drying I did grab some satin ribbon it's about 1/4 in in width and I cut a piece about 8 in in length now I'm going to make this into a shape of a fish and then I'm going to add a little bit of hot glue and glue this together and this will be our little hanger for our ornament and now that our wood piece has dried I'm going to go ahead and tape this down to a paintable surface and I'm using my Waverly chalk paint in the color plaster and I'm going to do a dry brush on the front and on the back side of this ornament now once everything is painted I am going to take that hanger we made and I cut a little piece of fabric out and I'm going going to put that hanger on the back side of this ornament so I'm just going to attach that with some hot glue and then once that is glued on there we're going to take a little bit of our tacky glue here and this is tight Bond tacky glue and we're just going to go ahead and add that to the back side of the ornament and I use a paintbrush on this cuz I don't want any lumpy parts so I want it to be as smooth as possible then I just lay that piece piece of fabric right over the top of that glue and this gives the back of our ornament a really nice finish next I have this box of paper flowers that I had gotten on clearance and I decided that I wanted to add one to the front of our little frame here so I'm just going to hot glue that Little Flower right to the front and to finish this off I'm going to go ahead and add a little bow at the top [Music] and now this simple little ornament is all ready to display I just love how this turns out I feel like you could add anything you want to the center of this Frame and it would look amazing let me know what you guys would add to the center of this frame in the comments below and if you're enjoying this content don't

always in thrift shops looking for high-end style home decor for a lot less than retail but today instead of hitting the thrip shops together I'm going to be showing you some of the updates and projects that we've been working on behind the scenes here for the past month or so really working on getting our home to be very cohesive looking and getting it more and more the way exactly that we wanted let's get going well welcome and thanks for joining me for our home updates and I want to share with you first of all our new floors for our whole first level I've been telling you that we've been working on them for the past month but first let me show you the old floors so if you've been following this channel for a while you may have noticed that I tend to show you lots of things on our area rugs and that's because I don't really care for the flooring itself and so in this shot where I'm Hing the mantle here you can see behind me the carpet in the room I'm on and then some different hardwood through the dining room and even off to the right on the very edge you can see that there's a strip of hardwood there kind of leading from the front door and then from months ago this footage where I refreshed our kitchen which was very very dark um you can see that this is a different flooring again and this is a vinyl actually that kind of looks like wood it's very orangy and I really didn't appreciate the tones that that brought into the home and then this is where it butts up against our back family room with a yet another um different flooring that's hardwood but it's very yellowy it's a different level also it's a different height um and so when you walked in from the front door you could actually see five different types of flooring if you count the stairs which were yet another color of wood in our first floor and so it just broke it up a lot and um so we're going to be replacing that all of it and it's so exciting with one fresh layer that matches and so we Dove right in and we did this oursel my husband and I while we were living here so we just worked on a little bit at a time and kind of mve things out of one room worked on it and just moved things around as needed and it was a lot of work but totally worth it so that was me there prying up some hardwood unfortunately even though this was hardwood already it just didn't match anything else and to get the different colors of wood to match each other and be the same height and everything would have been very difficult so and if you look in this photo on the left in the kitchen you can see that there was this additional layer of this particle board stuff that was nailed with a thousand Nails it was so hard to get up and then also in the dining room we ended up bumping our heads multiple times on that light that Circle so I'm going to be showing you the replacement for that as well so it was quite a mess for a while as you can imagine as we had everything uprooted and moved but the new flooring from stuga Studio was awesome and so here we are starting the process of putting it down by laying our underlayment then to the flooring planks which are beautiful I absolutely love this flooring and thank you to stuga for partnering with me on today's video I'm really excited to show you this flooring it's called cartwheel and so here's more footage of us just kind of doing the process rolling out the underlayment um Curry was probably wondering what on Earth we were doing this whole time so as far as the installation or rather the removal first I would say that the room with the carpet was the easiest because as you can see it's coming up pretty easily so compared to some of the other rooms where we were prying things up this was pretty simple and this is a closeup of the planks that we chose and again this style is called Cartwheel by stuga I'll certainly link to them below and I really appreciated how easily these snap together so there's just these little seams that you kind of lock into one another and push down and they they go together so smoothly and very very tightly this is a waterproof um flooring so it's wonderful the main reason I chose this particular engineered hardwood flooring was because of its durability that was really important to me so the cartwheel style is part of the rebels family at stuga Studio they call it the anti- wood floor wood floor so it's waterproof it's non-toxic and most important for me it's three to five times stronger than traditional Hardwoods it has Superior scratch and dent resistance and the price point is great for wood these are the most durable hardwoods in the world each plank is crafted from sustainably harvested logs from FSC certified forests and as for the maintenance it's just install and enjoy it's an incredibly easy floor to care for just vacuum and clean it with a broom regularly and then use a little bit of Bonet cleaner if you need to give it a dry mop and you are good to go I'm so happy with the cohesion that this cartwheel flooring brings to our first floor of our home it was so broken up and disjointed not only with the color changes of the different flooring types but of the height changes and so this flooring makes it come all together I can't even tell you how exciting it was when we finished up a space to be able to put the furniture back in that room with the fresh flooring it was so so good and so this is a shot of our kitchen which is a great example shot before with the orang vinyl and then after with the new flooring you can see what a night and day difference it makes and really just brings the whole Space together I'm so in love with it so as for some of the final floor details we decided not to keep the Builder grade baseboards that we had before which I think were the standard like 3 and 1/2 inch high ones we replaced them with these that are almost 6 in high instead and I think that that really made a big difference to go ahead and do that and it just has a more expensive and custom look rather than the standard Builder grade I don't know it just really adds um a lot to the rooms in my opinion and then also I couldn't bring myself to put the old floor registers back on those vent the vent covers this was by far the worst one in our home so it's a little embarrassing but I replaced them out for these antique brass ones from Amazon and it was totally worth it I love those I think they're really beautiful and so moving on to the next home update I need to share with you putting in some new curtains through the whole first floor and in one of the bedrooms I'm so excited to finally be trying out two pages curtains I had heard a lot about them so thank you to two pages for sending these over so that I could share them with you today and so these that you're seeing are the I ordered for all the downstairs windows and especially for the winter season I think that these are just perfect as you can tell they are a velvet panel so this style is called Tavis and I ordered them in the color taupe as soon as I touched them I fell in love with them because they are really high quality I was actually surprised even though I had heard from the reviews that they were really nice they are super nice so I ordered these in a triple pinch bate style as you can see they're along the top and with a room darkening backing and all of that I thought was just really topnotch I'm very happy with them they come with these drapery pens that you use and then you do need to just order the little hooks with the eyelids in them to actually hang them on your Rod so I got those easily from Amazon and they look like this so now personally in my ignorance I had never actually hung curtains with a pinch plate style before so I had to kind of Google it and make sure that I was doing it correctly but again they come with these drapery pins and these style of pins actually you can click them down to make the height of your curtain just perfect where whatever you exactly need in case your measurement is a little off which I really appreciated but this is basically how you do it if you haven't hung this style curtain you look for the little Channel that's built into each pleat area and you just take your drapery pin and find that little Channel and slide it up into it and then that is the resulting hook that will go into your drapery ring with the eyelet on the end and so it's pretty simple once you know what you're doing I just went ahead and slid all of those in and got started hanging them because of the material these were quite heavy so what I did was I kind of threw each panel over my shoulder to help support the weight and then I already had my rings on the rod first and so I just reached up and kind of hooked them in so it wasn't very difficult at all you do need to make sure that your rods are secured into your wall either into studs or with some sort of drywall anchor so it's nice and strong but that was fairly simple to do I'm glad I went with a taupe color because it's a nice earthy color but it's not too bright now these are the ones I chose for upstairs and I already know that several of you really like them cuz you asked me about them in the little snippet from last week's video these I think are so beautiful the style is called saret and the color is copper so I'll link both of these in the description box but I am loving the pattern on these this is my daughter's room and for these I ordered them in a regular pinch pleat top so not the triple just the regular pinch and then I ordered them with the blackout lining on the back since this is a bedroom but I was so happy with the color of these and I'm just in love with the pattern I think it's so charming and these are so elegant another feature that I ordered on this set was that they were memory trained so it means that the police that are here I didn't have to do anything with those to steam them or anything to get them to be perfect looking they are just already trained to be exactly hanging like that that you see so that was awesome no messing with them they're just perfect right out of the package I think that these are so elegant they perfectly like just grze above the floor exactly where I wanted them because they were custom sized so use the link in my description box to check out all the options on two pages and use the code Tasha at home for a 15% discount on your order now another area that needed an update was the interior of our front door so now that we have our flooring and our new baseboard done in this room one thing that I want to do is is go in and repaint this door area because we put in some new strips of trim if you can see the white pieces there and I want to paint this whole thing out including the little areas right around those window frames which are currently white um the door is the previous color I honestly don't remember what color it was called but I painted that and I should have painted those little teeny right around the window sill around the windows pieces and I didn't and now I have the new trim pieces that need painting so I'm just going to choose a whole new color and paint out the whole thing a little more properly and this color at the bottom right is where I just started um and then I remembered I was supposed to film and so this color that I'm using is called ethereal mood and it's by Sheron Williams and it's just this really beautiful kind of grayish color and it has a little bit of green background in it it's just beautiful I've seen it in lots of photos before I feel pretty comfortable with it so I'm just going in with my brush and a little roller and I'm going to paint out this whole doorway and then then we have brand new front door hardware for it so I'm going to get going one small thing that I did before I got started painting was I filled in these little screw holes along this Frame I'm not sure if that's normal for those to be exposed or if there was supposed to be some sort of pegs in them but that's how they were when we moved in and I hadn't addressed them yet but I think that just to go in with some spackling and fill in those holes and smooth them out before I started just helped the whole thing look more cohesive and those weren't distracting anymore so I just took the time to do that the day before and then I'm just going in with my paint I really love this ethereal mood color I'm using a brush for all of the outer portions like this and then I'm using a combination of the brush with the roller on the inside of the main door always keep in mind that paint will dry a little bit darker than it's first going on so if you're ever like wait this color is a little off from what I expected don't worry it's going to darken up a little bit and here's a little tip that my brother shared with me he's a painter so if you have a brush or roller and you need to stop in the middle of a project and get back to it later you can always just use a regular old plastic grocery bag twist it up really tightly make sure there's no holes and press it tightly against those and that'll save it for you so that it'll be still wet when you come back to it even if it's a couple days later so now I'm going to start on the door and I read an article a while back from Sheron Williams about how to paint a door and so it's always stuck with me the steps for painting a door like this with like inset portions are first you take your brush and you go and you paint the actual inset portion then step number two you paint the the raised panel that's in the middle of the inset around the inset edges and then you paint the whole rest so edges Center and then all around the rest so that's what I'm going to do I'm not going to be too careful around the hardware right now because I know I have new hardware waiting to go on and it's a little bit bigger than this these openings are so I'm just going to paint around those obviously you should take them off if you want to keep them but here I go it might just be me but I always appreciate a Time Lapse video it's just something satisfying about watching it happen so fast and so I think that this went pretty smoothly and I'm really glad that I did it it adds a lot of warmth and kind of a little bit more character over here to this corner and then this is after we have added the new hardware which is by quick set and I will link it just in case you were looking for a new set of Hardware I really like this in the outside as well and just adding my little wreath back on finishing up this space and since I loveed that ethereal mood paint color so much I decided to do another little touchup with it so this Hutch and table set we were given this was from years ago when we first moved in this photo and they were a very kind of bluish gray we're very grateful to have received them from a friend but we did replace the table at some point because we needed something a little bigger and then I had painted the front of the hutch with this color called clay Angel but I didn't do anything to the kind of inside the back of it and so I'm just going in now and covering up the remaining gray tones with the Ethereal mood paint and I think that once I'm done with this it really finally kind of brings this hutch in line with my vision and so you can see here how now that that has dried it's darker and I'm just going to go ahead and style this along with you because I think several of you really appreciate seeing that and so all of the things that I'm using here are items that I've already owned um the picture on the top middle I just hung with a command hook there so that it wouldn't mess anything up but I'm just using pieces that I already have on hand most of them are from the thrift stores with the exception being the woven baskets on the bottom which are from Amazon but that picture frame that I'm placing there is actually from the thrift shops just a couple of weeks ago that I neglected to show you in my last video and the candlesticks are from my last video those are a vintage set of soapstone candlesticks really love [Music] those and now since we're in the dining room I'll go ahead and show you what we did with that dining light that we kept bumping into and ended up breaking so this is just a shot of the dining room kind of How It's laid out so this is our new dining light you can see it I really love it and one of the reasons I think that this is a perfect dining light for us is that it is very transitional piece so the top shade portion is very angular and looks more modern but then the bottom kind of classic candelabra chandelier shape it's very traditional and so those two together I think it makes it the perfect transitional style piece for our home but the thing that I think you're going to love the most about this is its price if you're looking for a new dining light or bedroom light even this was only $79 from Home Depot I couldn't believe it but yeah such a great price and I think that it's so pretty I love the brass underside of it as well so I'll link that for you as well um this was not a promotional item this is just something that I chose and picked out from Home Depot um but wanted to share that with you because I think it's a really great find and also one final thing thing I'm going to do with it is just reach up and take off the little sticker usually there's kind of stickers on electrical items telling you warnings and what type of bulbs and all so once you know that information I just like to take that off so it's not distracting from it and just makes it look that much better and that about wraps it up for today's video we have been super busy for the past couple of months dealing with all of these projects and updates but I'm so happy with how far that we've come I'm going to link everything that I talked about that I can link just in case

putting aside since we moved in we've had family visiting we've been decorating I've been getting distracted and I want to finish up these projects before the holidays I want to get started on decorating for the holidays but I want to have a nice blank canvas to start with so we have some paint projects to tackle this week some small DIY projects I have some home updates for you and we have some mounting to do so I hope there's things that you can take away from this video and Implement into your home as well I want to start out with the kitchen there's so many things I want to change about the kitchen there's so many makeover projects and Renovations I want to do in there but for now the biggest thing I want to change is the color of the walls it is currently a dark sage green and it just kind of sucks all the light out of that room it creates a really dark environment and it just feels super detached from the rest of the house the entryway is white the living room is white the dining room is white everything else is white and bright except for the kitchen so I think we can create a little bit more flow around the house if I paint the kitchen the exact same white as the rest of the house I found this leftover paint in the garage they had it labeled downstairs walls and it's bare paint but it's a Sherwin Williams color you can see that Sherwin Williams color code on there and it's called West Highland white so you can actually get West Highland white at Sherwin Williams but you can also get it color matched at any other paint store which actually makes it more affordable but this is an eggshell enamel paint so it's actually perfect for kitchen walls making it really easy to clean having the walls currently green kind of makes me feel like I'm pinned to that color when I'm decorating for now so I want to free myself from the sage green Walls and kind of pick my own colors also it will give me more flexibility when picking paint colors for the cabinets and finishing out the rest of the kitchen so it's something I really wanted to tackle and definitely something I wanted to tackle before the holidays [Music] [Applause] part of me is like why are we doing all this painting if we're going to be changing it all anyways but sometimes when you're working on a renovation slowly or trying to reimagine your space you have to work in parts so just tackling one job at a time makes it a little bit easier and allows you to see the bigger picture so for me that's starting with these green Walls yes I'm painting around my light switches I'm going to be changing them anyways even walls like this eventually I want this entire wall to be Cabinetry so for the pantry door to be hidden in cabinets the fridge to be hidden in cabinets but for now this green white beige silver is like way too much happening I think it's going to make it a little bit better just having this wall white so just little things like that that are kind of bothering me I think cleaning it up with some some white paint is really going to make a big difference I'm just getting these small areas with my paintbrush and I'm going to use my roller for all of the other areas I like to just cut all of the corners and edges first and do all these small details so that it makes rolling on the paint so much faster the green moves all the way into this space here which which is just kind of like a bunch of different closets a staircase or laundry this is actually where we keep the cat litter just propped open in this closet cuz it's so deep and it's kind of our only place for it but we'll continue the white into there as well just to brighten up that little [Music] hallway I did already set up my first Christmas tree this is the one that we had at our old house it's a 9-t Christmas tree so this is the only room it could really fit in but we're also going to be doing one in this cozy family room and then another one in the dining room so you'll see more of that in my Christmas decorating video stay tuned for that I'm so excited to get this whole house decorated for [Music] Christmas I also have to take down this light and cap it this used to be the breakfast nook until this was opened up this light doesn't really need to be here we never really turn it on and I feel like it kind of blocks everything so I want to remove that as well but again we'll get to [Music] it okay the tedious part is done now we can just roll on the paint this should be pretty fast now but I can already tell it's going to look so much better in here I am so happy I finally am tackling this job also if you're doing any painting yourself get an extendable roller stick I can't even imagine painting with just the short end you would just be up and down the ladder it would take forever the extendable roller makes it go so much faster I never paint without it so I'll have this link down below as well it's a must have [Music] wow the way that just brightened this kitchen up instantly we're not even done yet at all but that is a major Improvement I'm not trying to paint this entire house white at the end of the day I actually want to like go dramatic with the paint color in the family room and like do accents like that but for this main area the brightness is really helping and it really creates a lot of flow for a house that's very traditional and has these compartments to it so this was such a good idea I didn't realize how big of an impact it was going to make but it feels so much better [Music] butter okay it's 7:00 and I'm done painting the kitchen I did that all within a few hours and it looks so much better like I probably should have done this the week we moved in but I didn't think it would bother me as much but this is so much better now all of the rooms just feel continuous because it is kind of an open concept plan in here and I wanted it all to flow and now it finally does when you walk through the front door the house doesn't feel like it's being broken into different areas it just feels continuous now and I think I really like that but now this is giving me more ideas for paint colors like I can see painting the island a different color painting our TV room over there a different color now I feel like we can do dramatic things now that we have a blank canvas sometimes you just need to like strip it all back to then have a vision for this space I think the green was really holding me back so I'm really excited this is so much brighter in here already I can't wait to see it during the day look what a difference it made during the daytime too it has never been this bright in here I'm so glad I did this the only thing now is it really makes everything stand out that's old and beige so all of these different switch plates we're going to have to switch these as well I have some covers coming in today that actually go right over top of the toggle they're not the prettiest but they really do just cover them and make them look white the covers look like this I used one in my office here and I painted right over top of it but it actually covers the old toggle as well so that allows us to not reh hardwire the whole thing and you can just temporarily cover it also I completely miss this spot these two spots beside the hood they're still green and I'm completely out of paint so we're going to have to get more paint to finish that off also this does kind of highlight all of this beige trim as well that does match exactly with the cabinets so I'm going to have to figure out what to do with all the trim I do want to replace the baseboard so maybe that's its own project to redo all of the trim around the house also this back hallway look how much brighter that used to be just like a dark tunnel it's so much better it used to be like bright dark bright and now it's just all bright and it's so much better today's project is something to finish off my home office I am obsessed with my home office if you guys watched my home office makeover you saw this space transform we added wall molding we painted we furnished and everything but the last thing I wanted to do was actually add a door here in this entryway I really like a quiet workspace so we finally got this French door installed I love it if you guys follow me over on Instagram you would have saw this whole install day definitely follow me there if you want some behind the scenes stuff like that so the door was installed but it's not finished yet because it's not painted so you'll see from the inside view this is what we're going to be finishing off today just painting this back side the same color as the wall in trim which is frosted toffee we're going to use the semi gloss paint so it's really durable I kept all of this film on the glass right now so that we could paint it freely and not worry about having to cover the glass so by the time we're done painting we can finally remove this and then you should be able to see right into my office which is so exciting and then the front I think we're going to just leave for now because I still don't know what all of this trim color is yet and I don't want to be you know adding a whole other new color in here so this was really interesting because it was just a doorway and it's not a standard siiz door so my options were either to go with a customized door which would have taken a long time to arrive and it would have been more expensive or we could kind of build in the entryway here so that it's a standard size by adding this extra frame on the inside here and then we could use a standard size door so this door is actually from Wayfair I'll have it linked down below you'll see it's a clear French door when I'm done with it when we remove all of that film we're going to be able to see through this onto the stairs and it's so cute I also ordered all of the hardware so I ordered the door knob and and the hinges and they are my favorite I got them from Wayfair again and I think it's from this company called nostalgic something I will link all of the things I use down below but this is called a New York plate with a homestead door knob it's like the style of it it's kind of like an oval egg it's really nice on the hand actually and then these are hinges with ball tip ends which I really love it makes it very decorative it's these extra details like door hinges that make such a big difference when you're finishing your home and I ended up going with unlacquered brass I want to use unlacquered brass as much as I can around the house because it's so beautiful as it ages it just has this realness to it and natural finish that I really love and it's such a rich color so I think it's going to be really pretty but the installer actually installed the doorknob upside down this whole piece here is actually supposed to be flipped upside down the long part should be at the bottom here I thought when I gave him the door knob and gave him the instructions he would be able to see like the long part is supposed to be on the bottom I didn't say anything I thought it was obvious and he installed it like this so he was so nice that I didn't say anything to him I didn't ask him to change it and I just left it cuz I'm like okay it's not that big of a deal maybe I'm the only one that would know that's upside down maybe you didn't even notice until I said it but I'm not sure if I'm going to flip it or not I feel like I'd rather not flip it because if I take these screws out now and flip it we're going to have holes in the door and then I'm G to have to fill it and then what if it doesn't look as smooth maybe I just leave it as is so that's okay I really learned that if you're having anybody come into your house and install anything be as specific as you can because this is what happens when you don't say the obvious things anyways the installer did say good job on choosing the hardware he's like this is really good quality a lot of people I guess that order Hardware through him like pick really cheap stuff that doesn't really last and it's hard to install so I highly recommend this Hardware if you're looking for some new hardware around your home it's not the most expensive option it's not the cheapest option it looked like a great in between with good quality and a good price so anyways I'll have all that linked down below as well as well as a door if you need a French door but let's get to painting I'll just tape around all the hardware as well since it's already installed I really should have painted the door before the guy came to install call it but I didn't get to that yet so this is where we're [Music] at so see how the film is still on there I can just kind of go right over top of it and not worry about the glass if you're painting a French door like this and you have already removed the film you can actually get this stuff called liquid tape that you paint onto your window and it creates like a barrier almost like tape and then you can just peel it right off so it's kind of amazing I'll probably end up using that for the other side of the door when we get to painting that but that's another solution for you instead of going around and taping every single Square liquid tape makes it so much faster [Music] okay that's the first coat of paint on I'm loving the way that's looking it's so monochromatic the door just like flows really well with all of the molding it just feels like it was always here which was the goal all along so anyways we'll wait for this to dry but when you're painting interior doors don't J just paint the face of the door here you actually have to open the door up and paint this Edge wrap that paint color around this edge here because that's the side that you see when the doors open in the room so make sure you just finish that off okay now that it's dry we should just be able to use this exacto knife go around the edges here just to cut that film off and it should just peel right off so there is film on either side of the door and all of these paint splotches is the primer from the door there yeah it comes right off in one piece that's perfect wow so this is also on the other side that's why it's not completely clear yet [Music] [Laughter] wow look how good that looks it looks perfect in that entry way so this is so nice coming through the door seeing through to the office but still having that privacy it's exactly what I was looking for [Music] okay today I want to install my little white Switch plat so we can cover those up I want to finish off this view from the kitchen into the family room so these beige plates we're going to cover up with our white plates and then I also marked out this spot here to potentially hang a mirror I was thinking a mini Gallery wall would be cute and it kind of camouflages the switch plates or we hang a mirror this is measured out for the mirror that I have over there on the floor I think it might bounce a lot of light from the sun room into the kitchen which might be nice and then we'll find a little corner to hang a mini Gallery wall because I have all of this great small art so see how this goes right over top of the toggle like that and then it still creates a functioning light switch if you don't have these covers you'd actually have to swap out this entire box which does require an electrician so this is just an e easy DIY kind of temporary way of covering that [Music] up look how much better that is it just disappears into the [Music] wall okay I didn't get the right cover plate for this one because this actually has two toggles and a dimmer so I'm going to have to get a different cover for here I'll probably go to Home Depot later and figure out a solution for that but this is where I was planning on hanging this simple mirror I like that it just has a white oak frame so it really matches with our floors but I'm actually thinking I might swap it to go vertically like this okay yeah I think because the vertical cabinet is over there this kind of balances out the shape on this side and I like how it reflects a lot yeah I feel like on a slim wall like this you can't go horizontal cuz that that actually looks really [Music] odd I'm using these 3M claw drywall picture hangers cuz I like that they come with these little markers so you mark the back of your art piece or your mirror and then they kind of just stick right to the wall exactly where your hanger should go and then you don't even need tools to install these you just press them into the drywall and they hang the weight that it says on the package so this one's 25 lb the mirror is definitely not even 25 lb so this is more than [Music] enough there it's almost like adding another window to the kitchen [Music] now over here in our guest room I want to finish out this corner with art I've kind of already started it with one piece but I ran out of time and didn't finish it off so I want to use small art like this that I already have just to create a mini Gallery wall and I just think it creates a very Cozy Corner with the lamp and the chair and it's such a cozy guest room that I think it'll be really special then we can kind of switch out art for the holidays create a christmy look and you guys know I love a little Gallery wall so sometimes you can create intentional Corners like this by layering in extra art maybe I'll move this chair out of the way so we can make room for mounting also yes we still have to mount all of our TVs I want to get them all up on the wall hopefully soon but that's a whole other task but anyways so much to do around here I think for this corner we'll kind of work up towards a diagonal design I don't know in a corner it just feels right instead of having everything feel really square and line up with the TV I kind of want it to feel a little bit more [Music] organic okay let's see what it looks like with the chair back in this corner I think that's cute I think it just fills it out so much more there's room for the lamp it's not covering any art this shape kind of fits into the gallery wall as well I think that's pretty cute there with the lamp on what a cozy little corner also this chair this is probably our most comfortable chair in the house and it's up in this guest room so I'm actually considering maybe moving it downstairs one day cuz I think we should get more use out of it it's just so soft and I love the color and style of it and then in between the windows here I thought we should add some art as well it just feels a little bit incomplete I got these beautiful painting things as a wedding gift they are stunning they're hand painted beautifully framed so I think they would look perfect in here and add a little pop of color and warmth to this wall I think two like that would look great with the windows when you're hanging art the middle of the piece should be around 57 to 59 in and then that will be at the perfect eye [Music] level those are so pretty if you have any empty corners or small little gaps in your home like this just put tiny art I feel like grouping tiny art is just the cutest thing I love the way it looks in [Music] here all right well that wraps up some of our DIY projects and decorating I wanted to get to this week I am so excited to decorate for the holidays and get started on more makeovers around the house there's so many more rooms I have to show you that need a ton of work like they're pretty much empty so we have a lot to do around here if you guys

'width': 480, 'height': 360}}",,77K4C0F7eH8,1119,126633,en,77K4C0F7eH8,the rft stores are full of treasures and lots of trash the key is to know what to look for and to see potential in items that others Overlook so in today's video I want to share what I think are some of the best items to Thrift for upcycling and repurposing projects I'll explain why these items are so great for creating unique decor and and I'll show you how I upcycled seven of these thrift store finds to create stylish decor for my own home so let's get started small wood containers are perfect for upcycling projects because they're versatile sturdy and easy to customize to make this wall basket a little more special I'm going to add a battery operated clock I removed the glass the hands and the battery box I cut off the plastic Taps on the back so that it would sit flush against the wood I used an angle grinder with a cutting blade but you could just use a sharp sturdy utility knife my plan was to attach the battery pack on the back of the wood and drill a hole for the center shaft of the battery pack so I I could attach the clock hands on the front however the wood was so thick that the clock shaft did not stick far enough through the hole so this clock is just going to be decorative I printed out a vintage looking clock face on a piece of card stock I used an AI editing tool in canva to remove the clock hands from the image then I peered it over the existing clock face using Elmer's spray adhesive I decided to paint the wood black to contribute to the Vintage look chalk paint works great on all kinds of wood and once it's dry it's easy to distress the edges with sandpaper if you like that look I hot glued the clock face to the wood and then hot glued the clock hands in the center to make it look like a working clock the plastic gold rim looked cheap so I brushed on some gold rubbin buff to make it look a little more like real metal then I decided to paint the plastic rim with the same black chalk paint I used on the wood the black color just makes it disappear to seal the chalk paint on the wood I brushed on antiquing wax which also adds some Dimension to the black paint I'm always amazed at how much character paint and in this case a paper clock face can add to inexpensive wood Decor from the thrift store [Music] here's another wood item I thrifted it's a cute cabinet but it's not really my style and the shelves aren't large enough to hold anything but a few tiny items so I want to see if I can make it more of a vintage looking statement piece first I remove the magnetic door clasp and then I removed the door the shelves were only held in place with two brad nails on each side so I hammered them loose but they were such a tight fit I had to cut them in half to get them out through the opening then I used some needlenose pliers to twist and pull out the brad nails from the side panels because this was a cheaply constructed cabinet there were a lot of gaps between the wood pieces that I filled with COA I let the COA dry for an hour or so and then I painted the cabinet with a light brown chalk paint I painted everything but the inside back panel which I planned on covering with some scrap wallpaper to create a layered aged over time look to the wood I first brushed on a coat of white wax lightly wiping away the excess I let the wax dry for a few hours and then I applied a layer of antiquing wax over the white wax again just lightly wiping away the excess to cover the inside I used a piece of William Morris peel and stick wallpaper left over from a recent bedroom makeover I cut it slightly larger than I needed and then used a utility knife to cut off the ex ESS along the four edges after letting the wax dry overnight I brushed on a third layer of wax this time using black which really gave it a nice vintage appearance because I may want to hang this on the wall I attached d-rings on the back Corners I could have added one shelf across the middle but I really like having an open space to create a display with at least one taller [Music] item books are so versatile in fact I've done an entire video on ideas for upcycling books for this project I chose five books in colors to coordinate with this painting of a young girl reading I removed the background in the canva app and printed it out on a piece of card stock to fit the width of the five books combined before attaching the picture I wanted to remove the titles from the book spines I found that Goof Off does a good job at this although this time it also removed some of the book color as well which I didn't really mind because I thought it just made the books look older I wrapped a rubber band around the books to hold them tightly together then to adhere the image I applied a good amount of mod podge to the book spines and to the back of the card stock then I lined up the picture with the bottom edge of the book spines and pressed it in place I rolled over it with a brayer to make sure that I got good adhesion once the Mod Podge was fully dry I lined up a metal ruler with the edge of the book spines and used a sharp utility knife to cut a straight line through the paper when I pulled the books apart there was maybe an eighth of an inch of paper that protruded beyond the book spines on either side I could have cut or sanded this off but I thought the image would look best if I glued those edges down pressing them over the sides of the books you have to work the paper with your fingers so that it conforms to the book spine [Music] storage containers are excellent items to Thrift for upcycling projects because they are both functional and easy to transform I chose a jewelry box because for $3.99 I couldn't pass up this vintage Beauty I love giving these old boxes some color with paint so I first removed the tiny Hardware some of them were screwed in and some were just glued in I gave the wood a good wipe down with some liquid sandpaper I'll clean the inside of the Box later I brushed on two separate coats of moss green chalk paint I really enjoy painting small decor items like this just use a small brush to get into tight spaces once the paint was dry I began cutting up an old calendar illustration into small pieces to cover the front of each of the drawers brush Mod Podge on the drawer front and on the back of your decorative paper and press it into place use your fingers or a brayer to smooth out the paper and to make sure that it's firmly adhered I also used my fingers to create creases in the paper along the outside edges once the Mod Podge is fully dry you can come back with a small piece of sandpaper along those crease lines so you can remove all the excess paper due to the wood detail on the drawer fronts it was impossible to keep the Sandpaper from distressing the surrounding areas I could have easily repainted those spots but I just embraced it and distressed the edges on the rest of the box too next I applied a coat of mod podge over the top of the paper to seal it make sure to go over the sanded edges too this will help to keep the paper from coming loose once the Mod Podge was dry I reattach the knobs and handles you could go over them with rub and buff if you want to change their color finally I applied a coat of clear wax to seal and protect the chalk paint [Music] like books I've also done an entire video on upcycling picture frames because they're so versatile and easy to customize I'm especially fond of the large frames with words that were so popular in the farmhouse style if possible lightly sand off the wording so that it's easier to paint over you could also spray the frame with a a good primer before painting I'm not going to change the color of this Frame I'm just going to give it a Fresh coat of off-white chalk paint I'm also going to paint these plastic butterflies even though they're already white I want them to match the frame perfectly and luckily chalk paint adheres well to plastic without needing a primer for the artwork I found this botanical image in the public domain and once again I used an AI editor in canva to remove some words and swirly lines from the image after I put the picture in the inner frame I noticed the gap between the frames so I grabbed my gun and filled it in once the was dry I painted over it I wanted to attach the butterflies to the large frame and just like with the clock face I used my angle grinder to cut off the plastic tabs on the back this would allow me to apply adhesive to a much larger flat area on the back of each butterfly to create a stronger bond with the frame I let the gorilla glue dry for a couple of hours and then I brushed clear wax over the frame and the butterflies to seal and protect the chalk paint [Music] if you've watched my channel for any length of time you know that I love to repurpose clocks they have so much decorative potential and come in a wide variety of shapes and styles you've already seen me repurpose a clock face now I'm going to repurpose the clock body I'll save the clock mechanism for a future project for some reason I don't like the flirtily design it looks very 1990s to me so I'm going to paint over all of the white areas with a CO a black chalk paint I think this gives it a much richer look once the paint was dry I sealed it with a coat of clear wax in place of the clock face I'm going to add a small bird's nest this one came with two eggs attached that are way too big for such a tiny Nest so I pulled them out before adding The Nest I hot glued a few Fern leaves into the bottom of the hole and then hot glued The Nest on top of the leaves and I filled in around the nest with some fluffy Moss I added a couple eggs back to the nest but using some that were more appropriately sized I added some tiny Greenery stems pushing them behind the nest and finally added a small bird to the edge of the nest [Music] [Music] bases are another thrift store item that come in a wide variety of shapes sizes and materials and are easy to decorate this galvanized steel vase has a really unique shape but its industrial look just doesn't go with my home decor so I'm going to paint it I added a scoop of salt wash to some off-white chalk paint and stirred it up the salt wash will add some texture to this otherwise very smooth surface I gave it two coats then when the paint was dry I cut out several small designs from iod's Del Traditions paint inlay package I brushed plain chalk paint onto a small area of the vase spritzed the cutout inlay with water and pressed it face down into the wet paint I used my fingers to smooth out any wrinkles then I repeated this process until all sides of the vase were covered in paint inlay designs make sure the inlays are completely dry before trying to remove them lightly spray them with water and then peel off the paper this creates a unique painted design to add some additional color I decided to paint around the vase opening with brown chalk paint to coordinate with the inlay designs once the brown paint was dry I lightly sanded over it to give it a distressed look I also lightly sanded over the body of the vase to further distress the designs and to smooth out some of the rougher texture to seal the paint I brushed white wax over the vase and lightly dabbed away the excess I used white wax rather than clear wax because it added a touch of yellow to the paint color contributing to its aged appearance [Music] thanks so much for watching today and please leave a comment if you'd like

Collection when it comes down to it this series is all about profit margins finding those items that we can build to maximize our profit margins as an example I've already been getting a ton of feedback from people making planters already this year and not being able to make them fast enough many have several thousand in orders and are killing it with projects just like this okay so for this first we're at actually going to be hacking or breaking down one of my latest projects my wife had asked me if I would build something for a laundry room that would hold laundry baskets now I've seen different styles of basket holders in the past and really wasn't a big fan of them so this is what I came up with so our house has a farmhouse rustic look so I decided to make this basket holder to resemble a giant crate and again I did not record a video on making this but I did share some pictures of the build with the patreon community and got really great feedback from it so I figured that it would be a great great one to share with you guys because it was super simple to make so I use reclaimed wood for this just because I love reclaimed wood but you can use whatever material that you have or you can simply use 1x4 material just like a crate everything in this build is designed around the same size slats and I decided that the best look for this would be 3-in slats so anytime that I'm talking about a part for this build just know that it's 3/4 of an inch thick by 3 in wide for each one of these side walls I used five boards that were 64 in long I laid those out on a flat surface and since the total depth for this build is 27 in deep I used equal spacing between each one of my boards until I had 27 in from edge to edge once I had everything spaced out I used 27in boards to actually make the rails that the basket would sit on these are actually going to serve two different purposes one is to obviously hold these baskets and the other is to actually attach and hold together these side frames so my side panel laid flat and spaced out the way that I wanted it I took the 27in boards place these going across my slats at 5 in 21 in 37 in and 53 in this would allow me the perfect spacing for my baskets now keep in mind everything that I've told you so far you can pretty much use for any size basket only difference that you may run into is the length of the basket you may actually have to shorten this up the sidewall construction will be the same and whenever I'm talking about shortening this up that's going to be your bottom and top braces and we'll get into those here in a minute once I had all of my 27in horizontal boards where I wanted those attach them to the vertical boards using wood glue and inch and a/ qu screws then you just repeat that for your second side now let's get into the spacing part for the baskets that I had I needed about 28 1/2 in of space so that's going to be measuring across the entire basket so in order to get that since I'm using 3/4 of an inch material for my sides I cut the length of my top boards at 30 in to make sure to overlap each side and since each side is made up of five vertical boards you're going to need five of the 30in top board boards now that you have your top boards we're just installing these using a butt joint so with my two side panels standing up I just put these right on top of each one of my matching vertical boards and attach those using wood glue and screws so at this point we have our two sides and our top put together then for the bottom of this crate I want of the vertical boards to go all the way to the floor so I inset my bottom boards and to do that I just cut five boards that were 28 1/2 in long but pocket holes on each end and install those with pocket hole screws now we have the four outer sides of this thing in the back you could run boards going all the way down but since there were going to be baskets in this covering this most of the time I just ran 3 30in horizontal support boards just to help to support the shape of this put one of those at the very bottom one even with the very top and one in the middle and the only thing left to do would be to add the two front boards if you notice I put one at the very bottom again this is just to help to tie everything together and one at the very top actually lasered that one with a little laundry sing if you don't have a laser you could use a stencil or just leave rustic but each one of those boards are 30 in long and I installed those again using wood glue and screws and that's it the basket holders that I've seen out there that aren't near this unique are selling for a ton of money so if you want to get into more of a mediumsized build guarantee you that this one will be a money maker so this next one kind of confused me a little bit at first whenever I saw it on the best seller list until I took a closer look and figured out that a 30 C add-on put it there and that's going to be this organizer so they just labeled this as an an organizer because it can actually be used for several different things you can put it beside your front door for Keys glasses things like that or you could use it on a nightstand for jewelry or anything else but basically it's made to organize things and people love organization whether they're organized or not they would love to be so that's why they're getting $40 out of this thing that you could probably make for a couple bucks again whenever I first saw this I was like there's something about it that I'm not liking what I'm not liking is that they've used a different type of wood for the base then they did the arm honestly they probably made a bunch of these little wooden base trays tried to sell those they didn't sell through an arm on this thing so like crazy I can't tell you that that's what happened for sure but sounds like something that I would do just not use different types of wood but let's get past that and let me tell you a super simple way to make this so let's start with the base of this thing it's 6 in by 12 in by an inch and a half deep and essentially it's a box with a little divider to make this box you'll need two boards that are 12 12 in Long about an inch and a half wide really the width of this is only going to change the depth so I'll leave that part up to you but for this breakdown we're going to say that everything's an inch and a half so you have your two 12in boards 45° angles on each side then you're going to need two 6in boards with 45° angles on each side now before you actually glue these Corners together you need to decide if you want to put a dado in your two 12in boards for this divider board as you can see here they've recessed this in to the 12in boards about a/4 of an inch so if you want want to do that you just measure down about 5 in on the inside of each one of your 12in boards then cut Doos about a/4 of an inch deep matching the thickness of your material if you don't have a dado blade and you still want this inset look you can also do this with a depth stop on your mitor saw or even setting a circular saw to 1/4 of an inch but if it were me just to keep things simple I would just use a butt joint and to do that you would just use the same inch and a half material measure the space on the insides of your box and cut it to that length now you can assemble this Frame only thing left to do is to put a bottom on this and again there's a couple of different ways that you can do this You' actually take a router cut a rabbit on the inside of all of this and set a piece of wood into this Frame or you could take a piece of4 of an inch plywood and just install that onto the Bottom now personally what I think the best look for this would be would be use a qu of an inch plywood then in the bottom of all four of my side Parts I cut qu of an inch grooves in each one of my parts on the table saw that way whenever you assemble all of this together around your plywood actually insets in and gives it a really nice look the only thing that you would have to change if you decided to do that would be the depth of this divider board regardless of how you put the bottom in everything's together and we need to make this little arm since this whole thing is 10 in tall we're going to need a board that is 10 in long and that's going to be our vertical board and then if you're using an inch and 1/2 material we're going to need an 8 and 1/2 in board to connect to it which would be this horizontal board they' used a butt joint for this covered with a piece of Hardware honestly if it were me just take a 10-in board a 12in board and put 45° angles on each one just put this together with some wood glue drop in some brad nails from the top just to hold this together into the glue dries now for the 30 Cent bracket that I think is the reason why I made the bestseller list these little things here all that they are is 90° brackets that you can pick up on Amazon for dirt cheap again like I said I found these for 30 cents each then as far as the hooks go again hit up Amazon you get packs of these things for next to nothing and the only thing left to do is to attach the arm to the box and as you can see by this picture it's all that they did is pre-drill and install this with some screws from the back all in all this is a super easy build and I can see where it come in super handy especially around a door as far as the pricing of $40 goes I would actually keep that pricing this thing would make a nice gift and 40 bucks for a customade gift it's

that they're wanting $50 for a set when I first saw these I was like actually that's pretty cheap till I saw the size you can actually make two sets of these using one 1x4 so 1x4 in my area right now is $4.80 so whenever you have $2.40 in a set of these selling them for 50 bucks a set is bank so for all three of these they using these same width of material and it's going to be 3 and 1/2 in wide and then for the small one it is 2 in tall by 7 1/2 in Long medium size one is 3 in tall by 8 1/2 in long and the largest one is 4 and 1/4 in tall by 9 1/2 in Long now if you add up the parts that you need for all of these it's only 44 in so let's go aad and just break down this medium one keep in mind that for the small and the large the only difference is going to be the height of the legs small one you'll need two 2in boards then for the tall one you'll need two 4 and 1/4 in boards since this medium one is 3 in tall we'll need two 3in boards for the legs and 8 and 1/2 in board for the top now they have assembled these using a box joint and that's probably why they're getting $50 a set for these box joint makes a really neat joint regardless of the type of the wood that you're using cuz being able to see the ingrain on the top of something creates contrast cuz the ingrain of material will soak up more stain if you've never cut box joints before and you have a table saw sled there's no excuses there's a ton of great videos out there on cutting box joints to get this look even if you do not have a DAT blade if you do have a DAT blade it's going to make this a piece of pie and if you do not have a sled again this is your homework build you a simple sled for your table saw they are super easy to make worth their weight and gold and will unlock a ton of new features for your table saw so if you decide to assemble these with box joints you would just cut all of your little tabs or fingers in the ends of each one of these boards lock and glue them together now let's say that you do not want to assemble these box joints you can just use a simple butt joint to attach these you just line your legs up underneath put in some wood glue and either some screws or brad nails from the top or you could also use pocket H from the inside bottom and hide those screws it's up to you then for the bottoms of these legs these notches that you see here which would actually be easier to cut before you assemble all of this but that's all that they have done is measured over about an inch on each side gone up about an inch maybe 3/4 of an inch and cut this out with a jigsaw you just put your favorite stained finish paint whatever that you wouldd like on this throw some delicious looking cupcakes or whatever that you'd like to Stage this up show what these risers are used for and how it creates Dimension throw a price tag on these at 35 or 40 bucks knowing that you only have a couple of bucks in each set and make some money okay so this next one I've been singing around for quite a while I haven't put it on here yet because it almost seems too simple but what I've noticed about these wooden books is now they are starting to show up on everyone's bestseller list so why are these best sellers well there's a couple of different reasons why I think that they are popular the first reason is the price they're selling these for $18.99 so you might as well say 20 bucks the $20 range is kind of an area that people see as Expendable income so most people don't have issues selling out 20 bucks unless you're like me and you are tighter than the bark on a tree and 20 bucks is 20 bucks but whenever it comes to home decoration and custom buil items $20 is nothing for people to spend so again these things are not near as big as what they look which makes them even cheaper to make these are only 3 and 1/2 in wide by 6 in long so again a 1x4 and if you wanted to shorten those by just a hair you can get four sets of these out of one board so basically you're going to cut your 1x4 into 6 in lengths take four of those knock off the edges on one side giving it this rounded look it's going to be representing kind of the edge of a book then on the very bottom board about 2 in in either using your miter saw on a death stop or your table saw like we talked about earlier I go and cut a little Notch for this Juke core de actually sit in that way that these books can actually set flat on a Surface once you get that Notch cut go ahead and paint these four boards up pretty much any color that you like almost all of them that I've seen so far are either solid white and there were a couple of black ones out there with white writing honestly for as cheap as you can make these I'd have about every color that you can think of then as far as the wording hit up Amazon for some 1/ in stencils now this one says Welcome to our home and seems to be very popular but you can add to this or take away from this and have it to say whatever that you want and I glue all four those boards together wrap this Juke cord around the top and it looks like that they've thrown in a little bit of greenery just to set this off you want to do that you can pretty much take about any type of fake plant just cut off little pieces of it and slide it in and that's all that there is to it again they're asking about 20 bucks for this and if you're making any of your sales by setting up at markets and things like that this one's going to be perfect throw about a $15 price tag on this and watch them disappear okay so this next one caught my eye for a couple of different reasons the big one of course is it is super easy to make and the next thing is is that it's Unique and that's this wood planter with five metal buckets so as soon as I saw this I could picture this like in a kitchen window sill or on a porch obviously this thing is made for small plants like as you see here these succulents see I'm getting better I'm learning the fancy plant lingo but overall it's just a neat look and they are wanting 60 bucks for this thing without the succulents now for me I'd already have these things loaded down with those babies because they're only like a buck a piece but you do you let me tell you how they make these $60 Planters with $2.30 worth of wood okay so these are 6 in wide by 31 in Long by 10 in tall the top board is an inch and 1/2 thick so obviously made out of two by material then the legs look to be an inch wide by an inch and A2 so if you were to take a 2x8 rip that down to 6 in the waist part for that would actually be perfect for these legs and since a 2x8 in my area is $683 that's what I would do so you have your material ripped down to 6 in wide then you would cut that at 31 in Long now for the hose for these buckets since these things are tapered and you'd actually want them to sit up above that hole a little bit if you're using a 4in bucket which you can pick up for right around a bucket piece then I would use a whole saw to cut these holes right around 3 and 1 12 in wide just make sure to use equal spacing for how many other buckets that you decide to put in this once you have your holes cut then it's just cutting your material down for your legs so if you notice on these legs they actually angle out a little bit to add a bit of support pie of pie it's all that you'll need to do is take your scrap strip from the 8 in board and cut four 8 and 1/2 in legs and it's going to look something like this then you're going to take this board stand it up against your fence and your miter saw and that's all that we're going to do is set our miter saw for 10° we'll put this sideways up against our fence then you'll make a 10° cut on each end leaving you with something that looks like this you'll do the exact same thing for four of these and you have your four legs so what about this cross bar here in the Middle with that you'll take a 5in p piece of your scrap wood then with your miter saw still set at 10° you'll cut one to look like this the angles tilt in towards each other and then I would just take my two legs measure up about 2 in from the bottom then install this cross brace looking something like that and to install this I just use some wood glue and Brad Nails then with your two leg assemblies made I'm just going to pretend like that this is the top it's going to set something like this and to attach this you can throw a couple pocket holes here on the inside attach it from the underneath or you can counter sync through your top into your legs this is actually really easy to make and one of those items that by just changing up the color of the paint or to stain this or to add different levels of distressing to it you could create a ton of different variations of this again they're wanting 60 bucks a piece for these things if you already had the buckets in there filled with flowers I don't think that you'd have a bit of a problem getting 50 bucks a piece for these things you do not have to have a fortune in tools or a giant Workshop to get started in woodworking I started off in my front yard and getting started does not have to be expensive you can actually pick up all the

That needs to stay in Vegas. I lost my friends around 2:00 a.m. at the Luxor. Some bachelor party guys found me wandering around. Bought me so many shots. They told me I was one of the bros now. Next thing I remember is someone shaking me awake. I'm behind a podium in a 24-hour chapel wearing a fake collar. There's a marriage license in front of me with my signature. Apparently, I got ordained online at 3:47 a.m. Two couples waiting for their ceremony. Staff thought I was the replacement minister, they'd called. Before I can explain, this old minister walks in, sees me in his spot, and just says, ""Finally, someone to cover my break. Do the next two, kid. Keep it simple. Still drunk, terrified, and now somehow responsible for legally binding marriages. First couple was too hammered to notice I was reading ceremony lines off my phone. I'm pretty sure he was marrying an escort. Second couple just wanted quick and legal. Didn't even ask why their minister was swaying slightly. The minister comes back, hands me $100. Good job, Reverend. Same time next weekend. I told him I was moving away and he won't see me again. Found out later from my bank statement. I spent $29.99 becoming an ordained minister between shots of Joerger. Both marriages are legally valid. Still get Christmas cards from the second cup.

Carolina I hope you guys are doing well and having an amazing Sunday and as you guys know today is Daylight Savings time so the time has officially changed which means the days are longer and we have a lot more time to get out here and do a lot of these outdoor projects which I am so happy and excited about because I have so many different projects that I want to start so starting March 20th the first official day of spring we're going to be showcasing all new DIY projects both in the backyard the front yard as well inside my home so I can't wait to bring those projects to you all so make sure you subscribe and click that notification Bell so you don't miss a beat so this video is actually showcasing three of my most favorite outdoor DIY projects that I just absolutely love and when I tell you these projects are super amazing you guys they're super simple definitely budget friendly I will be showing you guys the cost of each individual project and telling you what I paid for all the materials and y'all more so than anything these are projects that you can do completely by yourself and I'm going to show you exactly how I did that [Music] all right y'all so here's a look at the materials that I Ed for this first privacy screen DIY on the deck space so I actually purchased three of the lattice panels along with four 8T 2x4 boards and some screws and I will have um the exact items in the description for each of these project along with the cost of each project all right you guys so here's a quick look at the area that I'm going to be diying this is the deck rail that I'm going to be adding the Privacy Screen to and the reason I'm doing that is because whenever I stand up on the end of this deck I'll go towards the end of the deck and you know look out you can see the main Highway and cars passing by can see me and everything and I definitely want to add some seating in that space and I need some privac [Music] [Music] see so to start building the frame for this privacy screen first I started with 1 8T 2x4 that I'm going to be screwing screwing down into the deck rails and you'll see me do that in a few minutes all right y'all so here's a quick look at the screws that I'm going to be using to build this frame on the deck space these screws require no pre-drilling which is what I love so to get this Frame started I secured one 8T 2x4 to the deck rail and then also I cut out three 2T 2x4s and attached those to the 8T 2x4 and you can kind of see that here and on top of this I'm going to add an additional 8T 2x4 to give me that perfect rectangular frame that I need [Music] so here's a quick look at the frame so far I'm not done yet because I still have to secure the frame to the deck area and just screw everything down so what I'm doing right now you guys is securing the frame to the deck just making sure that it has adequate screws and that is secured nicely to the deck against the strong winds against the weather against any elements and so that's basically all I'm doing right here so in addition to this I decided to paint the frame black um I had some exterior black paint already on hand I didn't have to go out to purchase this or anything I already had some so I decided to do this just to kind of give it a nice contrast against the brown stain deck now this is something you don't have to do of course but this is just something that I wanted to do because I love the look of this on my deck space [Music] all right y'all so it is the next morning and I am trying to get an early start and what I want to do first of all is just number one enjoy my coffee out on the deck because it's such a beautiful day and then after that I'm going to go ahead and just kind of show you guys um you know my progress so far and start adding the lattice panels to the deck frame so let's get started so this is the color stain that I used to um stain my deck to stain the lattice panel is Canyon Brown and I purchased this from Lowe's it's by the valpar brand [Music] and just so you guys know these panels are actually 4 feet in width and they're 8 ft in length and to secure the panel to the actual frame I'm just using 2in brad nails and I'm just using my Ryobi Brad nail gun to secure the lattice panel to the frame so y'all this was a super simple and super easy weekend project I mean like I've told you guys so many times you can complete these projects completely on your own as you can see in all of my videos um and basically depending on your privacy needs you can even carry this privacy screen around your entire deck me I only needed it for the one area on my deck and like I told you guys before it only took me three lattice panels to complete this project [Music] and if you guys pay close attention to how it looks right now with just the one lattice panel up there versus me adding that second layer you'll notice that by me adding that second layer it closes up the gaps that's in between the lattice panel which is giving me the additional privacy that I need in that [Music] space all right y'all so here's a final look of what that privacy screen looks like so now the only other thing I want to do is I want to go ahead and decorate this space and I'm super excited about that you guys so let's go ahead and get started with that [Music] for [Music] [Music] all right y'all so before the final reveal I did want to show you guys what the back of the panels look like on the outside portion of the deck now pay no mind to this little area at the bottom of my deck I still have to stain it I ran out of stain but anyway just wanted to show you guys what the space looks like on the opposite side of the panel and I absolutely love the way this looks you guys and like I told you guys before depending on your privacy needs you can even carry this look around your entire deck area but before for the final review let's go back a little bit and be reminded as to what the space used to look like and again I did this on one side of my deck because I needed some privacy from the main road area and then in addition to that I also wanted to add a nice seating area in this corner so let's take a look at the final reveal [Music] w h [Music] hey [Music] he [Music] w [Music] all right y'all so now we're about to get started on our second DIY privacy screen project so if you guys can look here behind me this is the fence area I'm going to actually be doing the DIY project um and you can see of course the reasons why of my neighbors um I love my neighbors but I don't want to see them okay so before I get started with adding the Privacy Screen I'm going to clear out the area and what I want to do first is I want to go ahead and give this fence a nice deep clean I'm going to use my pressure washer and hopefully try to restore it back to its original [Music] color so right here you guys I actually have a spray bottle with some bleach and water mix and I'm just going to spray that on the fence that kind of help loosen up some of the dirt and [Music] grime so right here I've already dug my first hole for the Privacy Screen post and so what I typically do is I dig my holes between 1 and 1/2 to 2 ft deep and I'm just adding some PE gravel and that's basically just going to help with drainage and so the post will sit on top of the pea gravel and then from there I'll fill up the hole with the fast drying concrete and then add some water and then just let it set so right now you guys I'm about to add the fast drying concrete to the hole and so once I've actually added the concrete I'll add water to this and just kind of mix it in a little bit and just let it set and then I'll move on to the next post [Music] so right here you guys I got anxious I wanted to see what the lattice looked like on the post before setting up everything you know installing all the post so I'm just kind of trying it out and just using these two pieces to see what it looks like and if I like it and you guys I absolutely love it it's turning out exactly the way I wanted it [Music] so you guys will notice that I started using the smaller panels and now I'm about to use a larger one and that's because my design plan changed at the last minute minute at first I was just going to do that little one section of the fence but then as I decided to extend the privacy screen out further it was more cost effective to purchase larger panels good morning you guys so I want to go over a couple of things okay um because I want to make sure I'm giving you guys um stepbystep instructions but also I'm going to show you some some shortcuts that I did okay um so yeah yeah um let's go ahead and um take a look at what I've done so far all right y'all so before you guys you know get started with doing these types of projects or before constructing a privacy structure on your property please please ensure compliance with your local regulations by verifying permit requirements in your county okay so that's the first thing okay that's something I had to do as well so just wanted to give you guys heads up about that but what I wanted to share with you all is that the design and the layout of this um privacy screen actually changed um I decided to expand it and to make it larger and I'm going to show you guys what that looks like all right y'all so here's a quick look at what the um area looks like at the moment I really really love the way this absolutely looks it's perfect it's giving me the Privacy that I need from my neighbors um yeah I I really love the way this looks and like I told you guys um you know I started off with the smaller panels and then I ended up getting the larger panels and one of the things you definitely want to do and you'll notice it here I'm not letting the lattice panels hit the ground so you want to make sure you pick it up off the ground at least about three some you know about 3 to 4 Ines off the ground and so one thing uh you guys will notice is when I got to the other side of the fence which is actually my fence instead of digging holes and adding post to the ground I actually went out and just bought um 2x4s 8T 2x4s and attached those screwed those into the fence itself and then attach the panels to the 2x4s so that's something that I did um as well and then you can see here I have these little small 2 by two boards attached to the actual post and that's how I attach the panel to the actual post is with those little small 2x two boards all right y'all so it's the next day and I want to go ahead and decorate this space I do want to remind you guys that later on this summer I am going to be um having this whole entire area concreted with a concrete patio so in the meantime let's get started [Music] all right y'all so before the final reveal I want to remind you guys what the space used to look like before we pressure wash the fence and before we added the privacy screen so now let's take a look at the final [Music] reveal you got feel I [Applause] know you got to feeling I know you got the feel you got the feel you got feeling you got feel got feel [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] W all right y'all so with this last and final privacy screen project this is going to be a privacy pergola and so I am super excited about how this turned out uh this project took me maybe about two weekends to complete but these are the materials for the project so without further Ado let's get [Music] [Music] started baby you me ice [Music] and you're giv me Wind and Rain [Music] and here's a look at the gravel that I'm going to be using and they're like these little small gray rocks but I'll show you guys uh what they look like so I'm going to just put a little bit of that in there and that's just going to help with drainage so here's a look at the gravel I'm going to be putting in the holes and this is just some allpurpose gravel and again this is really really great to help with drainage [Music] so what I'm doing at the moment y'all is just basically screwing these boards into the bottom of the post this is going to keep the post standing straight up and prevent it from tipping over and this is something that you can do if you're completing this project by yourself so that way if you don't have anyone helping you or any assistance no big deal this is all you have to do [Music] on this channel you'll find tips tricks and tutorials to help you create something amazing whether it's outdoor Landscaping Home Remodeling or even interior design I believe that with a little creativity and the right tools anyone can turn their ideas into a reality so if you're ready to roll up your sleeve and get crafty make sure to subscribe and hit the notification Bell so you never miss a [Music] project all right so here's a quick look at everything after I've put all the post in the ground the only thing left to do now is to add the quick drying concrete and I'm going to go ahead and do that right quickly and while that's setting I'm going to go ahead and just take a maybe about a hour hour and a half break yeah y'all it's hot out here so yeah so that's what I'm about to do at the moment um I do want to just kind of tell you guys that before you do any of these projects where you're installing privacy screens on your fence or whatever the case is make sure you check with your HOA if you have HOA in your neighborhood if your neighborhood requires that um definitely check with them first and also check with your local County ordinance um because sometimes some of these projects may or may not require a permit so just wanted to make sure I remind you guys of that all right so I want to show you guys my progress so far so you'll notice that I kind of put like these squared caps on the top of these post and I did that because and I have to finish uh nailing them down or screwing them in I did that because I wanted to give the post that added height that I lost when I buried it almost 2et in the ground so I just extended the wood above the post and I'll show you guys in a second what that looks like so the post actually stops about about right here so I went ahead and just extended those up again just to kind of make up for the height that I lost when I buried these posts in the ground so that's the main purpose of me adding these um these box these boards and just kind of you know just to kind of increase the the height of it I guess so you can see here I've already added the the first privacy lattice or the lattice panel and to help me to get this up here and to um nail it in what I did was I screwed in these um screws here just a little ways in and I did it for each end of the post and so that way I'm able to sit them up here until I get ready to staple them so then that way I don't need assistance I could literally just place them on top of the screws here so that's what I've been doing and I'll show you guys that when I hang this other panel here [Music] so that's how I'm able to just kind of prop it up until I actually nail it to the post and so right now I haven't nailed it yet just wanted to show you guys so in case if this is something you want to do and you don't have any assistance just screw the uh the screw in just a little bit just to prop the panels up on the screw and then now all I have to do basically is just climb the ladder and go ahead and start stapling the panels or nailing the panels into the posst [Music] w [Music] go [Music] w [Music] w [Music] all right so what I'm about to do right now is cut the little pickets to go on top of the pergola privacy screen and so um yeah I'm just cutting those at a 45° angle on both sides [Music] all right so here's a quick look at how everything is looking so far now I'm going to go ahead and start adding the pergola shaped boards that I cut out on top of it and I'm going to go ahead and just kind of nail that down using my brand nail gun with 2in brand Nails all right so I've started cutting the boards um you can see I kind of plac them um on top of the pergola just to kind of get an idea of what they would look like and if I wanted to you know space them out a little bit or bring them in a little closer so um most of them are laying flat there's only like a couple that are standing up straight I haven't nailed any of them yet because I'm going to go ahead and paint them first so I do want to mention that it was never in the plan to stain this privacy pergola screen remember guys we had talked about uh just you know keeping it natural like the color of the fence well I decided at the last minute once I had built it that I wanted to stain it and so that's what happened here but typically I would actually stain all the boards all the panels before putting this together because it would have made my job a lot easier a lot more efficient so don't make the same mistake I did make up your mind early before you put everything together whether you want to stain it or not so right quickly here's a look at the little pickets that I cut um a couple of days ago and I've already gone ahead and stained them back and front so yeah now I'm just going to go ahead and start installing them so I can get this pergola done [Music] all right y'all you can kind of see behind me here that my pergola is still not quite completed because I ran out of pickets so I had to run out twice and get some more boards cut them and let me tell you the most tedious part is painting them painting the pickets you could paint them with the sprayer but to get that nice dark Rich stain you need a roller so that's what I had to do paint one side wait for it to dry and you had to paint them twice you had to go over them twice to get that nice dark richness um so yeah it is what it is all right y'all so before the final reveal here's a look at what that space used to look like before we added the Privacy pergola [Music] oh [Music] thank you guys so so much for tuning in

it was an inch and a quarter and I was right the whole time and I was like oh I messed up he was like well you know that that 1 and 1/2 is not this 1 and A2 what I like that I like how the flat part looks like there I I just Blended this one again this one looks better right I think that that's so romantic and really pretty and that is is really the look that I wanted good morning guys welcome back to the Vlog I'm already getting started for the day it's rainy today and the time change is it's a little harder um so it's a little bit later 10:30 maybe but I finished up my Vlog for today and I got some computer work done this morning so I'm in the bathroom I'm hitting the ground running on the next phase of it so I'm getting all my equipment set up so that I can start filming and I'm going back through the last episode of the bathroom design and reading all of your comments cuz you did have great ideas and I want to revisit them and try them all out so you'll see that in the next video because we do need a solution for the tub U that's not insane like buying a new tub I'm not I don't want to do that I want like a creative smart solution hopefully using materials I already have that's the goal so I want to go back through all your ideas and do that so you'll see that in the video for Sunday I was definitely taken back and shocked at the DraStic issue with the drain uh that I did not clean it's not bad I did not pick up anything though I just kind of like threw everything up was like oh I'm going to deal with this when we get back I can't even like I can't even process like what what is happening if you didn't see the video I'm talking about this tub and that drain that's kind of like out into the room too much I'm going to work on that today and I wrote on the plane right here in my notes in caps at my like to-do list that I keep of like all all the things that I need to tackle each day and stuff I said no procrastination just do it I realized that I do not have the luxury of procrastinating anything I've never had the luxury of procrastinating I procrastinate things that I've never done before and I'm constantly doing things that I've never done before and trying new things all of this shower situation and like you know just like this I've never had to fix a problem like this so it's new and I tend to procrastinate and think about it for a long time and I've realized now especially being a mom I have limited time to work and I can't waste those times because I want to be able to have a balance between work and spending time with Kade and he deserves that and I owe that to him and I owe that to myself so I wrote big at the top I was like no procrastinating no procrastination just do it that's what we're doing so I'm going to stop talking because that's what we're going to do so I'm setting up my equipment clean this up really quick and I'm I'm pretty confident I'm tackling the vanity get ready to go put all my supplies together hello guys welcome back to designing our Cottage bathroom in episode 1 we tackled a lot of the trim work and the doors finishing the floors in episode two we encountered a very large dilemma I just had an insane realization I am using this reti Stu that I used in our bathroom at home this stuff if you guys remember that project all the cabinets and everything when I Ed this I thought this product was the worst most intense smell the like repulsing smell that I had ever smelled and I'm sitting here and I'm using it and I was like this actually doesn't smell bad at all I was like why did that other one smell so bad like did I get a different kind or a whatever and I'm sitting here realizing that when I did that project while I was doing the bathroom I found out I was pregnant I must have had an aversion to the way that this stuff smells it doesn't smell I mean doesn't smell great but it doesn't smell bad that was probably a sign that I was pregnant and I didn't realize it I just thought it stunk I'm a personal apology to retique it I was pregnant and that's why I thought it smelled bad that is wild I'm not repulsed by this at all it smells like Play-Doh it doesn't smell bad at all that is wild to me okay it's the next morning and I just put the second coat on the vanity and it looks really good so I need to go get a few things we need to install all of the fixtures and the drains and stuff for the sinks so I need like a double sink pea trap for the drain I think some water for lack of a better term hoses cuz I don't know what they actually call like water you know like connections like water water things need to look in here and see what the faucets kind of come with cuz I need longer versions of like this thing going to lay out the faucet part oh yeah I was like did I get drains for these sinks I did I did that match everything so that's good this is going to show like how all of the pieces kind of connect let me take this with me so I get the right size trying to figure it out cuz I want had my SC are Cur apart from this kit so I need to extend it so I need an extension okay we got back we're making some we I say we lightly Romeo is making us some lunch turkey what turkey something turkey lettuce wraps lettuce cups yeah so we came back to a Thrive box and a big thank you to thrive Market for sponsoring today's video we love getting Thrive

tackle the pantry cuz it would really be great to have like the storage space for like Pantry goods and stuff this is going to be the pantry um so I'm going to have like a countertop and there's a plug in here that we can have like a microwave or the toaster oven in here and I want to do like not cabinet doors but maybe like curtains like at the bottom like really do it really cute like I'll put it in an inspiration picture but this has been our makeshift Pantry cuz I need to put like a I didn't know how I wanted to do the shelving in here I'm thinking two shelves can go in here cuz this could be for like hands like like baking sheets and other things but this has literally become our our pantry so I'm going to put all of this stuff away I was attempting to do all of the plumbing decisions myself for the drain and stuff and I was getting close but I doubted myself I was like I don't know I need something I need a reducer from the the pipe to the this and the that and my sinks further apart than the kits that they offer so I need an extension and you know I it's not close by so I don't I did not want to make another trip so I asked this nice guy that was working there and I was like here's what I'm trying to accomplish and so he we kind of laid it out and and I was on the right track I needed one additional part that I would have been missing that I would not have been able to complete it so he was super helpful um and really nice he made me feel like it was like you got this like you can do this not like you shouldn't be doing this he was just like a really nice guy but the thing that threw me was he was like well you know that that 1 and A2 is not this one and A2 what do you mean that what do you mean that one and a half is not this one and a half like the one and a half one and a half means nothing to these individual products they just make up their own measurement he goes basically I like oh my God whatever okay but we got it fixed so hopefully it all goes smoothly is on your right there was no sign the stel outside the house I just didn't want to walk up to somebody's and then right as I was going someone someone came out so they're going to put out a sign so that people know [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I've been wanting a Bandy mirror but this one's so like squared off at the top but it's the three I really like the three but it's too like I wanted it more like designed or made on top you guys it's the next day I've been staining and blending and blending and blending and blending and I need to blend some more on like the flat Parts this is currently where I'm at with the vanity and it looks so good I was worried there for a second I just ate a sandwich and I came back and it just look like really good the flat parts are harder to blend you know and trying to be really intentional about it but I'm also being really being really particular about it I just don't like I don't even know if it's coming up on camera but I don't like how streaky this is and I've blended it once already but I'm going to blend it again but would you like to know that everything that I bought yesterday at the hardware store is wrong every single thing except for like the primer and cement for the PVC stuff everything is wrong I second guessed myself when I was in the store the thinking the sink drains weren't actually inch and a quarter and I measured wrong I second guess myself because there was no inch and a quarter there was just like one little pack at the hardware store and I was like these are all new things like I feel like is inch and a half more common like it and I got back and I measured it again and it was an inch and a quarter and I was right the whole time and I was like oh I messed up so everything that I bought was wrong and even the water supply I thought it was half inch on each side because it was like that was like a normal thing no inch to 3 38 so I have to buy four more of those I have to return that whole bag of stuff that I bought but I can't go back there and just exchange it because they didn't have inch and a quar so I'm going to had to Lowe's and pick up but I'm going to blend this one more time cuz I put a coat on before I ate some lunch and um you know blend it out on on just on the side here blend that out and then we can um head into town again H it never fails why [Music] why I like that I like how the I just Blended this one again this one looks better right this one looks better than the side like I can blend [Music] it maybe a little bit but I feel you don't need to do too much not too [Music] shabby okay so made it to Lowe's to try and figure out new PVC um and they too don't have a lot of inch and a quarter stuff and I need that double bowl double bowl Outlet Waste Connection in an inch and a quarter and so we're looking at everything and I thought about a reducer I was like is that bad like is that like not a right way to do it but then they literally sell this one is like for a kitchen and 1 and 1/2 in or an inch and a/ qu reducer washer included and when I looked in it it just has these red things then I was like well maybe they sell the reducers and I look up reducer reducer washer set and then basically everything that I bought works except for I I'll need some new like water connections but then that's SP cuz they I don't okay we asked for help just to be safe I between multiple guys they were we were all kind of like confused about how to make this work he's like you're Franken signing it together but you can make it work so I've got so many pieces of PVC and plumbing pipes that I've got to be able to make something work we've been getting we've been getting you yesterday yesterday was the first time I've gotten this haven't been to Starbucks in probably years since they stopped making my toasted white chocolate mocha at holiday time I haven't really gotten Starbucks at all I wanted a Monstra it yesterday and they have this lavender cold lavender cream cold foam oat milk matcha yeah and I got it yesterday it was so good and so he got it without I I added a shot and I know that people think that that's gross but I like it I know that it's like a c two c different caffeinees but I like it okay let me try she literally haded test like 30 seconds ago look I'm almost done it's so good isn't it good well yeah I mean it's it's hot right now so it's not like oh why are they carrying a couch through the gas station they're they doing a tick Tok probably there must have been like 20 kids carrying a couch through the gas station well you guys happy Sunday it is officially Sunday and I have been on a Mad Dash to get as much as I possibly could done on the vanity before I needed to upload the video for days so I kept adding in and kept adding in as closest I could get um I get all the way to the final step like I'm like okay I got this last thing to put in and then I realized that an entire piece an entire piece was missing from the pieces that I was working on and staining and it was over there in my stash of pieces that came from this vanity cuz when the guys put in the sinks and the granite and stuff he had to take out the inside but I saved everything because you never know this is a situation like you never know when it's actually a piece that you're going to need this whole piece so that was like the divider between the two drawers and so I'm in the process right now of like find analyzing how the drawers are going to function the bottom is functional but modified and the top I feel like it's just going to be stationary it's going to be really challenging if it was even possible to make it work because there's nothing to like support it there's nothing to I can't attach anything anywhere to support it it's kind of tricky so I got to that piece and I was like well we got close to make finished but you guys get the idea so I'm not going to mess with that vanity any more today and let it dry I kept like you know like being so careful trying to put things in trying to build the inside and I'm like oh my God I'm going to end up messing this up because I'm not letting the sealer dry just just like we kind of leave it alone so I've got to let it let it breathe and then it's going to be a couple of day process probably to do this piece um because I've got to do the retique it then I've got to do the stain and then I've got to seal it you know so it's it's it's kind coming along the the vanity did come out a little darker than the wood trim and it's just like I didn't really have a lot of forgiveness with this stuff like I would have loved a real wood stained wood piece you know and if the wood was good I would have stripped it down but when when you can't have the real wood this is the second best alternative and it really does look good it's like does it look as good as if it was just a stained piece no no but it does look good so we're going with it finally eating the rest of my lunch I've been trying to eat on this for the last couple of hours of salad that Romeo made me cuz I was like filming and editing all day so like Romeo and and the baby went um doing a little shopping and stuff and went it went drove around Kate loves to be like out and about and going places and seeing things and so we make it a point to bring him out as much as possible but of course I'm you know especially when I'm here at the cottage I'm in like work mode like every day for long day long hours so we got it done this is all functional you guys I'm so proud all of our trips to the hardware stores paid off I finally got it to all work which is so exciting and now the green isn't making my floor look purple that I laid and we're going to be adding this wallpaper in here and look how pretty it's going to be with this as this is going to be the movement and the character and this is going to be like the Striking piece of furniture that's sitting in front of it and that is is is really the look that I wanted so I'm seeing the design starting to come together so I'm excited to do the wallpaper after we do the shower want to do the shower because it's messy and I don't want to mess up wallpaper so it's shower paint wallpaper decorate CU a lot of the like heavy detail work is getting finished now the shower is really the last piece and then this is going to make a huge impact when we add this in for sure also when I went to the hardware store I picked up some paint samples just to kind of play around with because I need to pick a color that compliments this for the trim and the ceiling uh and uh yeah the trim in the ceiling and the look the crown molding the base boards the trim on the doors all of that and I want it to be that kind of like khaki brown color that khaki the flowers that are in this um to kind of bring that lightness back into it because this is going to add a lot of dark on the wall which is exciting but also like I need some balance so I want to look at all of the paint samples like throughout like the different times of day um and pick that because I want to paint as soon as we're done with the shower I haven't quite figured out how I'm going to get up that tall all the way up there with tile I have my dad's 12T ladder but a ladder is going to be just like hard to put in here you know what I mean we shall see let's fingers cross when we went to those estate sales I didn't find anything for me I'm kind of picky I'm looking for lights that's it lights and Furniture pieces maybe like cute little things to put in the the bathroom didn't find any of that stuff I did get some frames for my mom he gets so excited when he sees his mama hi I'll be right back it's not raining anymore it's super like Bright Now there were ones at this estate sale that my mom saw that she circled in the picture hope put on the screen they didn't have those anymore and the ones that they did have I think were still pretty they just weren't quite as ornate but what they did have all in common is they had these really beautiful like deep Jewel toned velvet mats they need to be cleaned up obviously but I'm like I think that that's so romantic and really pretty I think that she can like make a collection of art that fits these and that looks really nice like those are orange this one's like a green this one's black you know the frames are more simplified but it's really pretty this one's like a deep olive green I was like Mom I think that they're like worth it and they're pretty sometimes you need that balance not everything needs to be like super ornate but it's complimenting and these still have like great details like in the corners and stuff I thought she would really like them so I was like I think they're a yes so that's all that's all we got oh Romeo got an a bracelet actually that looks like the ones that he's been like kind of looking for markets and stuff so we got that that was really fun so I'm going to attempt to finish this lunch and do some editing more editing I've edited like all day but I'd like to get this Vlog kind of edited so you guys can see it soon um and start working on the next Vlog and also the next project so if I can do a little bit that would be like really great they're pretty sometimes you need that balance not everything needs to be like super ornate but complimenting and these still have like great details okay I've been editing for the last couple of hours just trying to like stay ahead it's about 9:38 now and baby went to to sleep so I wanted to just like lock in and do it but I hope you guys enjoyed this Vlog I'm going to get up early in the morning and start on the shower and get cracking on that because I feel like it's going to take me a little bit it's quite a big thing to waterproof and tile two different tiles maybe more I not a lot and I also need to do some more research on like the tub fillers and stuff like a lot but slowly but surely this bathroom is going to come together so I'm really excited and again a big thank you to thrive market for sponsoring today's video I'm going to leave that link in the description box for you guys cuz if you join

to figure out what items to make and sell that people will actually want to buy in 2025 well if so you're in the right place because in this video I'm going to share 10 handmade products to make and sell that you can actually make a profit from and in order to determine this I have scoured social media such as Instagram and Pinterest as well as looked at consumer market trends I also am a Virgo sun and love data and details and I've gone really deep into the Analytics for this one so I'm really excited to share it with you hi my name is Sterling and if you're new to this channel welcome and if you've been here before welcome back on this channel I share all of the behind the scenes of running my fiber art business as well as business tips and some Fiber art inspiration so if you're interested in any in all of those things make sure that you subscribe and join back up with me each week all right well let's get started with our first item you might not be that surprised by this one and it is Bose that's right so cocat core has been everywhere for the last couple of years and it's only projected to grow even more into 2025 bows have not only gotten more elegant and creative in the way that they've been embraced and designed and according to Grand View research the global hair accessories Market size is expected to be valued at 31.6 billion USD by 2028 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.7% during the forecast period and the the great thing for this one is that you don't have to just make bow hair ties you can also find fun ways to style them with clothing or other accessories and just have fun with making it specific to your Niche continuing on with another product that would be great to make that is also a feminine accessory are scrunchies between verified market research and Global Market insights I've seen that in 2023 the hair scrunchies Market was valued at between 20 to 27 million USD and it's expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.5% by 2030 and with this one it's really important to stand out and really add your own twist to it explore your Niche and really lean into it because the more that you stand out the better make them retro or have more of an athleisure appeal or more sophisticated even and there are so many different approaches that you can make when styling them okay but maybe you're not a big fan of more hyper feminine style and you want to make something a bit more masculine or unisex even you might like this next one and it is handcrafted ties according to the cognitive market research the luxury tie Market is valued at 2.8 billion USD and will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3.5% from 2023 to 2030 men are currently more of the prominent consumer on this trend due to the increasing number of fashion conscious individuals Rising disposable income levels and growing population and men like to wear neck ties of different colors and moods to express their personal style but women are also starting to grow as a consumer of this trend as they're increasingly adding neck ties to their wardrobe so if you're aiming for more of that high-end luxury Niche this could be a great product to make but of course the more highend that your materials are and the more Lux your packaging is and your branding is on point the better now this next one might not surprise you if you're a crocheter like me I had to put this one on here for all of you crocheters out there and this next one is crochet flowers according to Ariston advisory and intelligence the US floral gifting Market was valued at 12.25 billion in 2025 and is expected to reach 18.99 billion by 2028 growing at a compound annual growth rate of 7.58% flowers are always in high demand for different various occasions whether it's Valentine's Day Mother's Day birthdays weddings and always make a memorable gift and a lot of people like to buy themselves flowers these days and what's better than flowers that last forever I've seen a lot of crocheters get so creative with the flowers but I've also seen a lot of flowers that look the same and yes timu I'm looking at you and so the more that you stand out with this one and make it yours the better these would be really cool to make personalized Arrangements around them you can even add them to gift baskets and just really lean into whatever your Niche is and continuing on with the more novelty gifting Niche this next one would do really well and it is novelty gift cards according to the greeting card Association Americans purchased an estimated $6.5 billion in greeting cards each year and the demand for handmade cards specifically is also increasing as they are perceived to be more personal and thoughtful this one is interesting because although the greeting card is expected to shrink from 15.9 billion in 2022 to 12.2 billion by 2030 this is slightly good news for us artists if you're a painter or an illustrator or even if you're a crocheter and a Knitter and you like to pair it with papercraft like I do and I'm going to tell you why Millennials are starting to become the new dominating consumer of the greeting card and are looking for something a bit different than the Hallmark cards of their parents they prefer something a bit more bespoke and unique so personalized cards eco-friendly cards or even more minimalistic cards do really well there's so many different niches to explore and different ways to display your art with greeting cards and there will always be someone having a different Milestone whether it's buying a house or having kids or getting married and you might be thinking aren't e-cards really growing in this space and while they are a lot of Jers and Millennials do find physical greeting cards to be nice and sentimental and have that nice Personal Touch so this could be really good news if you decide to lean into making this product and if you're just getting into selling your art online and are a bit overwhelmed about where to start definitely check out my free guide in the description box below on planning your online art business launch it's a nice questionnaire that will guide you through some different steps to planning your launch and if you're definitely overwhelmed about where to start and you want more of an in-depth checklist definitely check out my ultimate online art business starter checklist that's in the description box below as well but maybe you're like okay Sterling that's great but I'm not really into paper craft I'm a crocheter and I want to just crochet something well you might like this next one it is crochet dresses the global crochet dress Market was estimated by virtual market research to be worth $1.68 billion USD in 2023 and is projected to reach a value of 2.2 billion USD by 2030 growing at a cagr of 3.9% during the forecast period and one of the drivers for the growing demand of crochet dresses is the desire that consumers have for handcrafted and envir Mally friendly pieces and one thing you might be thinking is to make truly crocheted garments this would require me to price my pieces so high because crochet must be done by hand and cannot be automated unlike knitting which I do discuss in this video up here if you want to check that out next so I would have to price my pieces so high and another thing that you might be thinking is how am I supposed to compete with teu or Shen which can price crochet items really really cheaply and to that I definitely say Do not compete with them more and more consumers are wanting higher quality garments that are made with care and will last and pieces that they can invest in where the Artisans also receive fair compensation and treatment and here are some stats to back that up according to Virtue market research over 60% of consumers purchasing crochet dresses slided sustainability as a key motivator also eco-friendly and organic crochet dresses saw a 25% rise in sales in 2023 alone so if you find ways to refine your brand identity and narrative in a way that resonates with your target audience this would definitely set you up for Success do you create maxi dresses and formal wear such as bridal gowns or swimsuit coverups or something more tropical or even casual or sweater dresses that are more sophisticated there are a lot of design styles that you can play around with for this and definitely lean into branding it's always best to stick with high quality and natural fibers as well for your pieces and focus on producing quality over quantity you could also use a knitting machine to sort of emulate the Stitch style of crochet and this would automate the process a bit of course it wouldn't be crochet wear instead it would be knit wear but it would be a way to automate the process well how are you liking all of these ideas so far don't forget to give this video a like if you're enjoying them all right so this next item is really taking off right now and if you are a fellow fiber artist you might really like this next one and it is tapestry wall art the global wall art Market was valued at $53 billion USD in 2022 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.4% from 2023 to 2030 according to an online survey conducted by rent Cafe in September 2022 59% of consumers prefer to have a clean and minimal look for their home increasing the adaption of the minimalistic trend in the wall art industry although residential spaces are still dominating the market at 70% commercial spaces such as Hospitality boutique hotels shops restaurants and retail shops are also expanding with a cagr of 4.6% in the coming years so this is a great one to also have in mind who your ideal client is and what kind of environment you're creating pieces for whether it's residential or commercial or both or maybe you're looking for something that's a bit more economical and doesn't take much time to create well you might like this next one and it is reusable shopping bags reusable shopping bags had a valuation of approximately 11.25 billion USD in 2023 and it's projected to reach around 1533 billion USD by 2032 so if you're selling at farmers markets or are focusing on a target audience that's a bit more environmentally conscious this could be a great one to make especially with the bands of plastic bags in major cities across the world and cultural shifts that many consumers have to be more sustainable this one could be great to explore putting your own twist on the market bag another quick remake that would also be really great to explore how to put your own twist on would be handcrafted headwear the headwear Market size is estimated at 26.5 6 billion USD in 2023 and is projected to reach 30 6.34 billion by 2028 and you can make beanies if you're aiming for fall and winter apparel or bucket hats if you're aiming for spring and summer so this is really a great one to Niche down for and to put your own Spin and style on maybe you're focusing on making baby beanies and your target audience are expecting parents or maybe you're focused on making more high quality sun hats that are elegant and Chic this is really a great product to embrace your Unique Style and also give your clients something unique and fun to wear or maybe you're a designer and you love designing patterns or you just want to share with others how to create your craft and see it the way that you do well you might like this next one and it is DIY kits and this would be specifically curating everything from the materials to the design and putting it all together and have some nice packaging and some unique branding to allow it to stand out and fit your Niche craft kits had a market size that was valued at 41.8641543 growing at a cagr of 5.8% from 2023 to 2030 so this could be a really great product to dive into well what did you think of my 10 handmade products to make and sell for 2025 let

Today we're tackling the second floor, which will have a bedroom, an art room, and a bathroom. And as if building a hardwood floor out of popsicle sticks was not delusional enough, I decided this time I was going to use it bitty tiny popsicle sticks because I feel like their ratio looks a lot more realistic and will only be done in this bedroom because if I did it everywhere in the house, it would take me 3 years to finish it. I added some wallpaper that I wish I had in my real bedroom. And I added the paint color that is truly in my bedroom at home. This room is basically everything I wish my bedroom was because when we play with this together, we aren't just creating her childhood memories, but my memories of motherhood, too. My inner child has been absolutely thriving. I added decor on top of the dresser, a cute little reading light, a chair, and a basket full of blankets. To perfect all the edges, I added more molding. I am genuinely terrified at my mental state right now because I loved every minute of this, and that that's not normal behavior. Topped it off with a family portrait for more insanity before building a wall between where the art room and the bathroom will be. Last step of the day was building an art room for my paint obsessed daughter. And I always envisioned this little window with an easel. And I think this fun wallpaper and warm flooring is going to create a really playful room. One of the craziest things about this room is I didn't think it was that insane when I was doing it. And now I'm watching my fingers hang up. 3cm molding and build all of this furniture out of popsicle sticks. I'm like, you're right. This was actually mental. I added more of her favorite books and a cute little toy box. Final touch, staining the wood of the easel. And the art room was born with floor toseeiling gingham wallpaper. It is so playful and fun. The painting in here is very advanced because my daughter is amazing. And I just know my art obsessed daughter is going to have the best time playing in this room. At this point, we have three out of the six rooms in this house completely done, which means tomorrow we'll finish the bathroom and I might build a library with over 500 books.

Your singing is horrible. My singing is better than Taylor Swift's. Watch this. I am better than Taylor Swift. Speaking of Taylor Swift, I am going to her concert now. It's holidays and I cannot wait because the Taylor Swift concert is today. Oh my god, I lost my tickets. What will my mama say? But I got a plan. I know that I can steal my sister's tickets and rent. And now they are mine. Girls, it's the time. Get in the car. We are going to drive. Hold on a second. Where are my tickets? They were in my pocket a second ago. Unlucky sister. Be careful next time. Without you, we shall enjoy the show. Are we their mommy? Yes, we are, dear. But this ain't Taylor Swift. I am not a fool. Did I say Taylor Swift? Oh, that isn't cool. I meant to say failure gift. It's the summer school. What? Like and sub if karma rules. I got sent to a summer school. I hate school. I want to go home and watch. Sweet, sweet revenge. Guys, like this video if Karen got what she deserved for stealing Pina's concert ticket. But wait a second, where was I? We forgot you. They think I got karma. But Pelina doesn't expect what I am going to do in the next short. And this time there will be no karma. I found my sister's diary. It's time to throw it in trash. Where is my book? It's in the bin. Your face I will smash. Get roasted NPC. You can never beat me. I am supreme. Younger sibling wins. It's time to use my brain and outsmart her face. That sister inside my diary was a thousand bucks for your grace. A,000 bucks for me. The diary must not flee. Time to dress up as an old man and get her back. It's time for a karma attack. I must look, look, and look. Do you want this book? Yes, old man. Please give it to me. I will sell it for $500 fee. If I give him 500 bucks, I still get 1k. Okay, as you say, have a good day. Let's open the book and get my pay. But wait, inside there's just a note. Thanks for $500, dummy laughing. Oh, hell no. So, when was you dressed up as the old man? You tricked me again. Just accept it, Karen. No matter what you do, you always get karma. Karma isn't real. Yes, it is. No, it's not. Yes, it is. No. Yes. No. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Enough arguing. Let's just see if Karan will get karma in the next chore. Hey brother, I bet you,000 bucks. I can jump from the roof without getting harms. Fine. I accept this bet, but I am afraid you might be dead. Then deal it is. I will be back in 5 minutes. Easy dub for me. The middle kid wins. Oh, hey, I am back. Wait, what the d? Not a single bruise now. Give me your bucks. I am too cool. You got fooled because I jumped into the pool. One week later, want the same bed again. I can jump from the roof without any pain. I accept easy money. But why did you agree? Because yesterday drained the pool. I think I broke my knee. Calm down, Karen. Didn't we tell you this was going to happen? I don't understand how. I am the smartest human alive. I even got the Dumble Awards prize. You mean the Noble Awards? No, Dumble. I am so smart that I always use code avocado when buying Robux. Well, that's true. I always use this star code, too. And to prove how smart I am, I even got 90 out of a 100 on my test. Really? Show us. Watch this. Mommy and daddy, look at my results. I got 90%. That's almost no faults. 90 from 100. I am so impressed. Daughter, you really ace this test. Something seems you dumb. I am not dumb. I am a stupid bum. Be honest with us. Did you draw the zero? No, I didn't. Because this time I am the hero. Then let's see what the lie detector says. I didn't draw the zero. No need to stress. She didn't lie. But how? My sister was always dumb. Tell us the truth right now. I didn't draw the zero. But fine, I kind of drew the nine like inside the ground. See, I told you guys I am the smartest. You mean the dumbest? The stupidest. Hey, I am not dumb and I am not stupid. I am a idiot. Uh, anyway, I am now an adult and I am going to stay up all night. Oh, really? Want mom shout at you? No, I am a grownup girl and can do anything I want. At least that's what she thinks now. But you want to expect what happens in this next short amlon and eat my lunch. Middle and oldest. It's time for plan B. Hey dear sister, did we hear this right? You are staying up all night. I hope you will be all right. You must put up a good fight. And if you don't make it in heaven, we will reunite. Whoa. Who will I fight? And why could I die? It's the monsters of the night. You might lose your arm or you might lose a leg, but if they are hungry, they might bite your head. Well, good luck, baby. We are going to bed. I will be fine. They are just making life. Should we cook her with fries? No, let's cook her with rice. Let's eat her ears. No, let's eat her eyes. I will go to sleep. Just give me a last chance because I just poop my pants. These monsters are so scary. I am never staying up again. Karen, me and Kaka have to tell you something. I'm not kaka you. But yeah, Karen, we have to tell you something. What is it? The monsters were us. We dressed up to scare you. You outsmarted me. And since we're talking about outsmarting, I got a perfect song we can react to. I am selling brownies for free and lemonade for 100 bucks. You dummy, dumb, stupid. Your business sucks. No one will buy your lemonade and your brownies are too cheap. I know what I am doing here is a brownie for you to eat. Now, do you want some lemonade? Of course I do not. I bet $100 not a single glass will be sold. I know people will buy it and I bet it will be you. When I tell you that the brownies are made from you, give me lemonade and take my money. Would you also like to buy some water? Honey, how much is it? 1 million. I'll never pay such fee. Even if I tell you that the lemonade is key. That was so funny. You really outsmarted that Karen. I really did her dirty. Speaking of dirty, I have a test for you sisters. A test to see if you have a dirty mind. That's easy for me. My mind is as clean as a toilet after I have Taco Bell. Let's do the test. I am a baby girl and I'm a baby boy. I don't believe you prove your point. Once my mommy leaves the room, I will show you something good. I will show you something big and only boys have this thing.

Well, your name is literally Kaka. I told you 1 billion million giga cadillion times that my name is Vava. Calm down, Kaka. That's it for calling me Kaka. I am going to expose you all. Expose us? Yes. In the next short. And next we have Vava. Go Kaka. Go Kaga. With a song called Time to Expose Family. My family are evil and they always call me Kaka. It's time to expose them cuz they are sussy baka. This talent show is a perfect chance to reveal the truth about mom's romance. What? When daddy is at work, mom calls Uncle R. They spend two hours in the bedroom doing a quiz. You But daddy ain't an angel. His past is also great. Instead of getting milk, he meets with auntie May. A little poo on your face. Little Karen steals mom's money and spends it on Robux. But no matter how much she spends, she still sucks. I don't suck. I play like pool. And finally, Pina. I know the truth about you. Said what?

And if it turns out to be outstanding, I will take the credit for it. Look, this is a bizarre thing that This is a bizarre thing that uses these as its main ingredient. Oh, what else? There's a giant What is this? There's a giant two-lb block of cheese. There's a half a gallon of milk. And there's a stick of butter. Can I do this? Nobody move. Hold on. I think I can do this. This is like food jenga. And that, ladies and gentlemen, okay, forget it. And that's all it is. These go in a pot with the milk and the cheese and the butter and you just melt the whole junk together. And then you throw it on some pasta. We're basically making cheese ball mac and cheese. We're making cheese ball mac. That's what we're making. And it's going to be How's it going to be? I think it's going to be awful. But but okay, I should take that back. Ashley Chance and I tried one of these. And Chance, how can it be bad? It was great. Yeah. Okay. So, I I take it back. It's going to be great. So, one here, Max Max, one change to it. Uh, the recipe, if you can call it a recipe, used a block of like Monterey Jack and cheddar along with the cheese balls. I'm using a two-lb block of pepper jack because why not? Just give it a little boost of flavor because without this, it's basically one note. Nobody likes one note unless you can only sing one single note. Well, okay. Shouldn't take long. Let's go. This might fill this whole thing up. I don't know. It's kind of the biggest pot I've got, but we're going with it. And we begin with our cheese balls. Now that Oh, there we go. In the video, it was done in a slow cooker. We're not doing that today. Now comes our cheese. Okay, there's this. Come on now. Please. Heat's on. And now a half a gallon of milk. We're making cheese ball mac. The milk will heat, the cheese balls will melt, and then the cheese will melt. This is just the dumbest thing ever. And now a stick of butter scattered around. Okay. Honestly, there's really nothing I can do at this point. Do you think this recipe has been passed down in her family for generations? Passed down from to Clearly, I ain't breaking that guy up until things start to happen. I mean, this has got to melt. It's going to We're going to be here a while. As the milk heats up, these things will start to break down. You see this, Max? They're losing their structural integrity. They are. And when they start to break down and warm up, the cheese will start to get affected. Look it. It's going to be a while. We're a little bit worried that the balls have been designed to withstand the nuclear apocalypse and that they might not melt. What gives them that color? There can't be actual cheese in them. Wait, let's look. Number one ingredient is not cheese. It's cornmeal. Then vegetable oil, then canola, corn, cotton seed. Hang on. Cheese has got to be on this. There you go. About eight down is cheddar cheese. So, ladies and gentlemen, this might be the shortest video we've done, but we're just waiting for the milk to melt. The balls, the balls will heat up. The cheese will start to Watch. If I try and do this, I'll do a couple of those. That might make it happen a little faster. I'm going to get my camera a little bit further back. You think I'm going to splatter? I think you might do something. Pepper jack cheese on you. Okay, there we go. A little reminiscent of when we made mashed potatoes out of potato chips. Remember that? Those were good. They were. That was good. What are those like prison potato? Prison mashed potatoes? Yeah, something like that. Okay, it's been about 3 or 4 minutes and if I grab a piece of cheese, I think you can see it's starting to melt and steam a bit. That's good. Okay, so it's not going to be 12 years like it was in that crockot. It'll be maybe only one year. It's kind of It's starting to smell pretty good. All right, we're 10 minutes in. And look, it's starting to actually smell pretty good. I mean, overload of that cheese ball smell, which is kind of nice. Wants to stick to the bottom a little bit. So, be sure to do this. Drag across the bottom and the sides. I mean, look, we got a little ways to go before these guys completely break down, but we're getting there. We are definitely getting there. And then we're going to toss it with some pasta and put bacon on it like they did. Oh. Oh, look. There's the biggest piece left. I don't think anybody else is still that size. Okay, it's happening. Well, so we're about 10 minutes in. I think mediumigh heat. And you can see I think I've got maybe what 5% of the cheese balls still in roundish shape. I'm now appreciating why you would want to use a slow cooker for this. You got to have patience for a slow cooker. You got to have patience. But you see, you don't have that. The crockot slow cooker heats at such a low level that you don't really have to worry about stuff sticking to the bottom like I do here because I'm using a little bit more heat. And then it's just a gradual emulsification of the That's not the right word. What do you call it when those things melt? It's And then it's a gradual meltation of the cheese ball. Reduction. Reduct. No, that's just what's melting. Breaking down. What's breaking down? Anybody? a general breaking down of the cheese balls. So, if you like how this ends up and we will be honest with you about how it is and you want to do this and you have a crack and you have a crockpot, that might be the I have a crackpot. That might be the way to go because I need to stand here and stir to keep it from burning on the bottom. And that's fine. But listen, here's the time to do this. You got a [ __ ] ton of kids for like a soccer or baseball team that you got to turn a bunch of food out for. Dump all the crap in in the morning. Turn it on low and go to work. You're suggesting they feed this to children. Well, kids eat these cheese balls. Listen, there's nothing organic or fresh or healthy or positive about this, but they're kids. If at any point in their life they should be allowed to eat some shitty food, that's when they're little. They don't know any better anyways. And this is the stuff they want. What are you going to do? Okay, guys. After the soccer game today, I'm making whole wheat toast with avocado and sprouts. That's probably going on more often. You know what's going on in LA? For sure. That's happening. Oh, mom. Not those sprouts again. Can't we get the pepper ones? I can't even think of an LA name to call the kid. What's one of those bougie? Chansancy. Name some kid you went to school with. Jaden. Uh, yeah. I was going to say it ends in like den, you know. Uh, Ryder. Ryder with an X. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we're there. It's pretty smooth. I'm ready to make this happen. So, let's get rid of this. And here's my pasta to drain. Two pounds of this squirly guy, whatever it's called. Fusili. Fucill Jerry. Is that fusiling? I think so. Then we do this. We get rid of this. Oh, it's heavy. We put our receptacle in the middle and we dump in our pasta. And now, let's ladle in some of our sauce. I don't know how much. Definitely more than that. I think I'm going to use maybe half. You want this cheesy, right? Okay, one more. And now we can mix. Oh, I think I want more cheese. 100%. Oh my god, it's crazy. It could take even more. I mean, I think I could have one more pound of pasta. I think this would do three lbs of pasta, and that's going to feed a lot of 10-year-olds, right? It just doesn't feel I feel like I'm looking at dry spots, and I don't want dry spots. Do you? No, Chancy. No, nobody wants a dry spot. Okay. Absolutely. This is 2 lbs of pasta. I've got about a third left. I could absolutely do that. We're only going to give it three things now. We're going with bacon. Maybe the kids don't like the green onion, but this guy does. And fresh ground black pepper. Boom. Take that, cheese ball heads. And as great as it looks, we know looks are not important. Well, they are a little bit, but what is important is how is this potential abomination? Okay, before I take a bite, what do you notice? No green onions. Max took them all off for his picture. He doesn't want green onions. I can't have them. Look how cheesy this is. Oh man. One big old bite. Form. Still steaming. Four ingredient mac. Five counting the bacon. 5.25 counting the two pieces of green onion that are left. Okay. [ __ ] It's pretty good. Look. Look. You got to be a cheese ball lover to enjoy this. But if you are, you're going to love the hell out of this. It's actually really good. Probably simpler if you do it in the crock pot because then you don't have to stand and stir the whole time. But either way, it's great. It' be better with more green onions. The pepper is key. And I think green onions make the Stop it. Listen, I think what else is helping this along is that I didn't use a giant block of just regular cheddar. The pepper jack is really the way to go. Okay, this is to you guys in Max's sourcing videos on Instagram in the middle of the night.",1,The video does not contain any claims lacking credible evidence

It's a chocolatecovered shoe cake now. Great. Yummy. Well, here is my cake. I'm going to decorate it with buttons. Beautiful. Uh, what? What do you mean? What? Well, well, well. What a shoe. Who ruined my cake? Are you kidding me? Oh, I'm afraid of him. They ruined my cake. I won't do anything. Oops. Wow. Um, what? What is that? Let's try it. Hey, it's rubber. No, that's bad. I don't need shoes. And this looks much better. [Music] Wow. Picked a rainbow inside. It's super delicious. And chocolate buttons. Nice. This cake is definitely the winner. I won. Oh, sorry. I've already come up with something. I'll just take readymade donuts. They're so sweet, but not sweet enough. We'll put chocolate on them. Let's do [Music] this. Ready? What kind of donuts are these? Wait a minute, Grandma. This chocolate needs to be melted. Heating it up. Great. Now it's chocolatecovered donuts. An interesting idea came to me. Grandma, warm up. No, my hair. Grandma, I did not know you were wearing a wig. Oh, come on. It was fun. Some sprinkles. Oh, yeah. [Music] Oh, a shot. Calm down, Danny. That's not for a shot. I need it for chocolate. Great. And now we're going to fill these dotas with chocolate. They're going to be so [Music] juicy. Oh, yes. Incredible. Doing this to all of the donuts. Now we need some sprinkles. Actually, I'm going to use powdered sugar. It's the [Music] best. Smells incredible. I'm putting all donuts into a basket. Perfect. Chef, what have you come up with? I've already prepared chocolate dough. It needs to be poured into a mold. Perfect. Now, let's add some fire. It will take no time for my huge donut to be cooked. Nice. [Music] It smells delicious. Taking the doughnut out of the mold and pouring some Nutella. It's better than any chocolate syrup. Beautiful. Red sprinkles are next. It already looks [Music] delicious. Well, I am done. Try it. Everything looks so delicious. I'd like to start with this one. It's so huge and just for me. M yummy. What about this one? How lovely. M smells like chocolate. Cool. There's chocolate inside. Not bad. And what is this? Dude, like on my picture. Awesome. Well, who's going to win? Chef, you made the best donut. Yes, I'm a professional. It couldn't be any other way. And now I want ice cream. Come on, make it [Music] faster. Oh, I've got a jar of Nutella. Let's try making ice cream out of this. Everyone loves Nutella. Chef, this is weird, huh? Whatever. We need to add milk and M&M's. putting everything into a jar with Nutella. Next, mixing it up. Awesome. We're closing the lid and sending it to the [Music] [Applause] fridge. We need to wait a bit. Grandma, what about you? I'll make ice cream out of fruits and berries. Putting it into a blender. [Music] Nice. Next, covering it with a lid. Blending it all up. It's quite powerful. Grandma, I'll help you. I just need to unplug it. Oh, thank you, Danny. Well, there we go. Putting our mixture into an ice cream mold. freezing it with instant freezing spray and putting sticks in it. Incredible. It's going to be [Music] delicious. However, ice cream should be covered in chocolate. Let's use these colorful bars. Great. putting it into different glasses according to colors of course. We've got yellow, pink, and red. And yes, some fire to melt it. This is awesome. Here's our ice cream. And dipping it in chocolate. [Music] It already looks so much [Music] better. I love this. Hopefully baby's going to like it as well. Putting it on a plate. And voila. Well, I'm going to have Kit Kat ice cream. One scoop into a bowl. Actually, a couple more. Excellent. Next, a chocolate egg. Let's greet it. Incredible. Moving on. Pouring some chocolate syrup on top. And freezing everything. Wa! Check this out. A chocolate spoon holder. Huh? How do you like my idea? I think it's genius. Definitely interesting. Cool. Oh, it's time to get my ice cream. Let's see. Oh, it's very frozen. Bring me some ice cream. Okay. There we go. I guess bona petit. Oh yeah. Let's start with the most extreme one. It looks so chocolatey. Let's try a bit. [Music] Well, not bad. What about this one? Oh, popsicles. Trying the first one. It's delicious. And the second one is even better. Awesome. Oh, what is this? I need to break ice to get to the ice cream. Cool. I would not do that for an ice cream cone. I don't want to do it anymore. The winner is Grandma. It's my turn to celebrate the victory. Thank you. Oh, thank you. This time I want something with sticks. These chocolate sticks. Great. I have just finished putting together a chocolate cake. Let's make it perfect. Now squeezing some cream around the cake. Nice. Distributing it everywhere with the help of a spatula. And pokey chocolate sticks. Zach loves them so much. I'll put them around the cake. Wo, they look perfect. Now, some Maltesers chocolate balls. Everything tastes better with [Music] them. Putting them on top of the cake. Well, I think it's incredible. I'll take out my signature muffins. My grandson Zach loves them. Oh, pouring some chocolate over it. It's going to be even better this way. Moving on to chocolate steaks. I'm going to insert them into muffins. Oh, this is so cute. These are little hedgehogs. How [Music] lovely. Incredible. What do you think, Daddy? Cool. But I also know what I'm going to do. I need to break a chocolate bar first. Wo! We've got some chocolate chips now. putting them in a jar. Now I need a burner. I'm going to melt this chocolate. Well, I did it. Perfect. Let's fill up our gun with [Music] [Applause] it. Wo! Do you see that? It's like a Christmas tree. Colorful sprinkles on top. And done. Look. Beautiful. Thank you, Grandma. Wo! You've come up with a lot of delicious things. A Christmas tree. Let's try it. H, that's cool, but it's too easy. Wo! Chocolate muffins. Uh, how do I try it, Grandma? Moving on. There's a whole chocolate cake here. Let's give it a try. Wo! This is so delicious. But I'm kind of tired of it. H, I want to eat this, too. This chocolate Christmas tree is the winner. Oh yeah, I won. Oh my gosh. Cool. For an occasion like this, Chef has a great idea. How about a Skittles fountain? Let's go. Perfect. And start. Oh, look at these colorful candies. I love them so much. This fountain is going to be filled with candy, which means it's going to be rainbow colored and very sweet. All I have to do is melt the candy with these superpowered [Music] burners. Voila. Everything is ready. Wow. Do you like it? Wow. Grandma needs one of these right away. Where does it turn on? That's good. Oh, chef. I didn't see you there. Sorry. Uh, that hat looks so good on you. Thank you, Grandma. Yeah, I've been in a row. I think it's time to melt my chocolate. Or my granddaughter is starving here. Oh, I bet the gum fountain is way cooler than the chocolate, isn't it? It's definitely not something the little one has tasted yet, but I know she loves gum. And look at this spicy one. Hm. Will she like it? Well, let's try. What? It's too hot. Yeah, I didn't like the taste, but it melted my gum for the fountain. Okay. Okay, we're ready. Wow, you guys. I finally get to try my chocolate donut. It's so beautiful. Wo! Look at this pink. Is this gum? M. It sure isn't chocolate, but it's so delicious. I loved it. Ooh, look at the bubbles I can make. So much fun. Okay, this is classic milk chocolate. Ooh, that's delicious, too. H. Just what I wanted. Wow. But look at these colors. Let's try. M. That's amazing. I love Skittles. I want more. And I'm going to drink this fountain right out with my straw. Wo. This is unbelievably delicious. Wow. Chef wins. Yoohoo. Mercyu. Oops, my hopup cat got hurt. Uh, granny. This is so embarrassing. Now I want pizza. Mama mia. Oh, I see. Okay, you can fry the batter with a waffle iron. Add ketchup. Just like that. Then more salami. and cheese. It'll be delicious. Uh, what? Okay, you should put more broccoli in the pizza so it's not only delicious, but also healthy. What a beauty granny's pizza is turning out to be. I forgot about the cheese. I know how to grate it. But I have a great sharp jaw. I always crack nuts with it, so I can grate cheese, too. Ah, perfect. As long as no one sees my little secret, here is the oven. And we're going to heat our pizza right away. And wait. Okay. To make an awesome pizza, I order pepperoni straight from Italy. The rest is a matter of skill. Just like that. See? Oh, bravo, chef. Now, my waffle almost burned. It didn't. I remembered about it just in time. Time to put it on the plate. Oh, it's so hot. Okay, let's add some sauces on top. Mustard and ketchup. I don't need that anymore. Perfect. Okay, here is my pizza. Oh no. Is he alive? I don't know. Chef, are you okay? Mama mia. What a nightmare. Oh, are you going to be done soon? I'm really hungry. That's amazing. Here you go, sweetie. Okay, let's see what we've got here. Ooh, so many choices. But is this pizza eaten or something? Chef, what is this? I don't feel like eating it at all. But grandma's pizza. Well, I'd love to [Music] try. No, don't tell me there's broccoli in it. A, that's disgusting. I'm not eating that. Huh? My sister's pizza smells really good. H, I don't think it has broccoli. Ooh, that's a lot of cheese. I love it, sis. You won. Really? Yay. Thank you. Can you please make me some pancakes? Huh? Of course, sweetie. Oh, that's where the challenge should have started. Nana always has flour on hand. To make the delicious batter, we need 400 g of flour, an egg, and some fresh milk. Now, we need to mix it thoroughly so that there are no lumps, and we start the pancakes. I will make them in the shape of bears. Ah, here's my little Look at these. They're so cute. Add some chocolate and flip over. [Music] [Applause] It's ready. Aren't they perfect? Ah, I'm sure my granddaughter will love these treats. Some whipped cream on top to make the muzzles and berries. Uh, Grandma, you can't be serious. You can draw anything out of pancake batter nowadays. You can even make a whole burger. You have to be more imaginative to win the challenge. My burger only likes strawberry sauce as ketchup and perfecto. Excellent. Oh goodness. Oh, granddaughter. Come on, let me help you. I survived. Here you go. Ooh, thank you, Granny. Now, I'm going to make the faces, too. I'm going to make a funny unicorn out of these pancakes. and add more candy and ice cream. And I'm going to draw hair out of cream and colored sprinkles. Oh, look at that. Check this out, sis. Wo! That's so cool. That's quite an effort you guys did. I want to start with the unicorn. Ooh, it looks so beautiful. I don't like the taste of it at all. Okay. What cute little bears. I'm pretty sure grandma made them. M. They're really cool and delicious and so chocolatey. I'm so excited. Perfect. All I have left to try is the chef's burger. M. It is so good. Well, it's decided. And the winner is grandma. Really? A thank you. My goodness. Thank you all.",1,The video transcript does not contain any claims that lack credible evidence

This video was done in partnership with HP and Nvidia. They sent out this device at my request, so I can give you guys an early look at it. So, the heart of this device is the new GeForce RTX 5080 laptop GPU from Nvidia. It's an excellent performer on this machine. You get very high frame rates across pretty much any gaming title on the market right now. This 5080 is comparable to the top-of-the-line 4090 from last gen in traditionally rendered games, but the biggest performance increases come when you look at titles that support Nvidia's DLSS tech. So, the 50 series gives you better upscaling performance for higher frame rates, lower latency. It gives you better ray reconstruction so that ray trace effects are faster and look better. And you also get access to multi-frame gen up to 4x for smoother visuals. Now, do keep in mind that a game does need to support DLSS in order to take advantage of all this tech, but the majority of demanding titles do. something like 750 games and app support at this point and I think over a 100 games support DLSS 4 already. So, the CPU is also new for this launch. It's Intel's Core Ultra 275 HX CPU. And this chip is fantastic. It outperforms last year's 14900 HX very readily, and it does it with less power consumption. I had to rerun this test several times cuz like it just wasn't what I was expecting. You can get last generation's performance for like 40% less power. I mean, a chip like this is something that performance laptop users have been hoping for for so long. a chip with really good energy efficiency and really good multi-core performance. Intel's never had that ever until now. And because it's so good, I think that's the reason why HP has manual overclocking control for both the CPU and the GPU in their software. It's the first time they've done it. And there's also an unleash mode which bumps up the wattage on the CPU to 75 and the GPU to 175 for a total system wattage of 250. And all of this is handled by their new thermal system. So, they're running a new Omen cryo compound. It's a liquid metal, but it's a custom compound that's more viscous to prevent leaks down the line. And they also have a new vapor chamber setup that was designed to dump heat quickly. They've positioned the components on the laptop so they can have shorter heat pipe runs, which reduces thermal resistance. And the result is excellent thermal performance. This is one of the coolest surface temperatures I've seen on a gaming laptop. The fan noise on the balanced and performance modes are quite good. You almost never hear the fans come on when you're just using it for regular tasks. But if you go to the unleashed mode, the fans do get quite loud. And there's also a special feature that was built with Intel. So, the fans have the ability to automatically clean themselves. It's the first time I've seen this done on a laptop. And it'll intermittently and automatically reverse the air flow, like the direction of the air flow on this device. So, it actually cleans the fan in the process. It gets rid of any dust that's built up and it does it automatically. You don't have to think about it, but if you want to, you can disable it in the software. Uh, now the keyboard is a very brightly lit colored up keyboard. This is a latticeless keyboard. There's no framing in between the keys from the deck and it just allows the illumination to shine through in this pudding style of glow effect and it's very comfortable to type on. I find it fast and responsive. And of course, you get the individual RGB controls on this keyboard. Also, there's a light strip at the bottom or like the front bottom of the device that lights up for a diffused underglow to the laptop if you're looking for it. And of course, this is fully controllable in the software as well, so you can customize it to however you want. Now, the inside of this device gives you access to two RAM slots, two MVME slots, as well as the 83watth battery. Now, the battery rundown tests on this laptop were good. It's a noticeable improvement compared to devices that were using even just the previous generation of chips. It's significantly better. And also, I'd consider this to be like a full day battery at this point. If you're a student, bring this stuff to school. I think this can easily last a full day of kind of school work and stuff without bringing an AC adapter. Uh, now the screen. This is a 240 Hz panel that's bright with great colors out of the box, fast response times, and games just look awesome on it. Now, in terms of ports, on the right side, we have one USBA. I'm assuming this is to plug up your mouse. Uh, on the left, you get two USBC as well as your headphone jack. And on the back of the device, you get the rest of your ports. This is just rearfacing ports to kind of keep your workspace clutter-free. Uh, it's a aluminum build on the top panel and the bottom panel. It's like a very well-built device. I'm glad they chose this year to redesign this thing cuz like the chips this year are absolutely worth the extra effort and time they've put into this. So this is the new HP Omen Max 16.

argue that this is probably a lot more important because when was the last time we had a brand new graphics card launched that cost a mere $219 I mean we can build a full budget gaming PC system that's going to be awesome for 10 HP and 1440p gaming for literally less than half the price of just a graphics card so join us as we actually go through all all the parts that we have on our desk here today how easy or difficult everything goes together and then of course at the end we're going to show you those all important gameplay Benchmark numbers so you can see exactly how this graphics card and this system actually performs it is going to be a pretty epic and hopefully not very bumpy ride so join us for everything you need to know we after a short word from this video sponsor corsair's new IQ link Titan RX callers have arrived bringing high performance calling to your gaming PC thanks to the IQ link eco system and interconnecting Corsair RX fans installation is a breeze it's compatible with both new and existing Intel and AMD chips and thanks to the high static pressure fans and the new flow Drive cooling engine pump you can expect to game hard while staying cool and quiet learn more about this incredible cooler today with a link down below so yeah I think it's fair to say that this is probably not going to be the most cuttingedge graphics card in the world when it comes to Performance but realistically how many gpus do you know that have launched for about $200 and how many cards do you know that are pushing the boat out when it comes to the vram capacity because this is the ack challenger b570 but as you'll see this 10 GB of vram that you have on this card itself if you go for the b580 that will step up to 12 gig but even at 1080p there are going to be certain games if you turn all the bells and whistles on highest textures then you're going to find that 8 GB isn't enough and I don't want you to go thinking that just because you've got 8 gigb of vram you're going to run into problems in all of your games because that's absolutely not the case it's more the case at the moment that that can happen in certain scenarios But as time goes on obviously more and more games are going to release that will need more vram and having that little bit extra cushion of the 10 or 12 is going to make a significant difference in the titles that use and demand it as you can see this is not the largest graphics card in the world I will say though that it's not going to be the outright most power efficient it should be fair bit better than the previous generation Arc cards but they still recommend a 600 Wat power supply if you are pairing it with this you probably can get away with lower if you're using more budget friendly CPU which you almost certainly will be but it is something you should definitely bear in mind but of course the graphics card is just one part of the equation and I'd say actually the hardest bit of getting a budget friendly gaming PC is not choosing the GPU cuz that's one part you can almost just filter it from low to high look at some reviews and you'd be good to go getting a complete system that you're not spending too much money on one component and really extracting the most performance you can at your budget now that is tricky and that's what we've aimed to do here if you do want to see a rig that's actually probably slightly cheaper than this and in some cases is actually going to have slightly more performance you can find my full cheapest b580 video in the top rank corner of your screen but I found that that compromised really in terms of what it could offer in the future but then also today I'm far more comfortable actually recommending that what we have here on our desk today cuz it is going to be a more complete PC today and into the future and it actually starts with this this is an a620 M motherboard so this is obviously a fair bit cheaper than b650 if you can buy b650 for the same sort of price of this it is what I would recommend really there's not huge amounts of differences other than the fact that you will tend to get PCI generation 5 on an SSD for b650 but not really that important but then also the power delivery of the motherboard should be a little bit better which means if you do want to upgrade it at a later date to a really high-end CPU it's going to be more accommodating whereas this is pretty much more geared towards 65 W CPUs that we have here today maybe slightly higher but if you do decide to go and drop like a ryzen 9 in it it's definitely still going to work but you just might be a little bit limited when it comes to the amount of power that can go into this whilst keeping everything cool and the performance in theory could suffer but as you can see this is a microatx board so you can get a smaller chassis if you want to go down that route IO is still fairly decent though you've got USBC a really fast usba as well and then you do also have this bias flashback button so if you did want to grab a newer chip I'm not recommending a 9800 X 3D but as an example you could drop that in here and then without needing an old chip at all you could use this to flash the bio so it supports it which is always a nice feature you've also got this little heat sink here for your SSD but as you see it is fairly Bare Bones it's not the most complete thing in the world in order to actually start building our PC though I'd highly advise that you do drop your motherboard down on the box itself it's just easier you've got far more light you can sort of see everything all the text on the board is really small and it gives you just a good overview before you get started pay attention to the power that you have on the right hand side this is called your ATX power then we have our 8 Pin CPU power at the top left and then in order to actually get our case to do a so when you press the power button it needs to send a signal to your motherboard or actually it's the other way around it connects a circuit and obviously turns your system on these are these little uh headers down the bottom here if you like these little pins you do also have these fan headers here this gray one is specifically for your CPU you don't technically need to use it for that but I would highly advise that you do so that obviously stops the CPU from cooking itself which would be very bad we have some rgbs as well so we've got LED and then digital LED depending on the board and how high-end it is you usually have some more up here at the top as well this gets all of the RGB to function within the system unless you're using like an IQ system or something like that and the last but certainly not least we have this one down the bottom called f audio more often it's called HD audio and this is for an analog pair of headphones or headset to actually plug in again to your case but that's pretty much all you need to know you've also got this one I suppose here called clear cosos moving on then to our next component and arguably the most important after the GPU it's the CPU and you may have noticed that there's been a fair bit of press recently about the new b580 and presumably the b570 as well being that you do need to pair it with a decent CPU or you will find that your performance can suffer more so than some of its competition so things like the 4060 or the 7600 for instance and this is also called a 7600 this is a ryzen 57600 and in an idea real world you'd probably actually save yourself a little bit of money and go for the 7500 F but it seems that you can only buy that from system integrators or from AliExpress and that's not something I would recommend to everyone so certainly bear in mind I know Edis car did buy one of these he got it tested the performance and it seemed to work as expected if you want to play it safe and you actually want slightly more performance then this six core Chip is going to be slightly better but it is a fair bit more expensive this as I say is the ryzen 7600 it's a six cord chip and you just want open up this socket and then with this little lever you just secure this down into place once that is safe and secure though you can then arguably move on to the third most important part of your gaming PC which is going to be the RAM and I actually want to say I've kind of undercooked this one a little bit because this was one of the first kits I was sent out from Corsair when ddr5 launched so remember this is ddr5 not ddr4 but this is 32 GB of the stuff but this one is actually running at 5200 MHz whereas I believe the kits that you can buy now roughly for around about maybe $80 75 or so if you're looking in a sale in the right place then actually the kit should be slightly faster than that obviously you're aiming for as close to 6,000 MHz as possible really to unlock the True Performance of this chip but it's not the end of the world if is slightly slower and again you're trying to save money so would you really want to spend 25% more on some Ram that might give you an extra frame or two do make sure as well that you do put it in slots two and four I realize I'm in Marcus PC Centric talking mode if you have them next to each other you're actually going to get half the rated speed and if you put them in slots one and three then your board isn't necessarily optimized for this but obviously if you're going for four Ram slicks Ram slicks RAM sticks uh just Chuck them in all four Once you have pushed your RAM down as far as it will go until it clicks into place you then need to grab a couple of screwdrivers or at least one screwdriver with a couple of heads uh they're both Phillips cross head this one is going to be used for most of the screws but for your SSD this is where you need something that is a little bit more miniature so we're going to remove the slot cover here or this heat sink do make sure that you remove the plastic peel as well on the underside if you haven't already this is just going to allow for a little bit of the heat from the SSD just to transfer onto this and then the fans in the system should actually move that heat away but as you can see it's not the most ginormous one in the world crucial's P3 plus definitely not the highest end SSD in the world but it's absolutely going to do ourselves the trick and it is going to save ourselves a little bit of money as well so that is pretty much everything then that we actually need on the motherboard other than the cooler and you don't have to buy one of these because if you do go for the 7600 you should get a stock one inside the box that is going to be sufficient should do a decent enough job but it's going to be a little bit on the louder side the temps are definitely going to be higher than I would like really so if you can spend around about like 20 $25 or so on something like this it's going to look a lot better and is going to give you much better performance this is the hyper 212 this one is the Halo edition so you're going to need an addressable RGB for this but I also figured it would go with the fans that we have we can Daisy them together and hopefully we have a very good looking system but you'll see that it's not like the largest heat sink in the world but it's obviously a lot bigger than the default am5 one so what we're going to do then to actually get this ready to go on our board is to kind of break it down into literally just the heat sink itself we've got two screws inside there and then you grab these little AMD brackets then push it up from underneath and just make sure that that hole is perfectly lined up then put the screw in you see PC gaming isn't difficult it's just fiddly or at least it's fiddly to build them you could get someone else to do it nothing wrong wrong with that but obviously you'll be paying for the privilege we will need to remove the default mounting hardware though that comes on this very straightforward four screws that just comes off along with the other side then obviously we need to grab ourselves some thermal compound and this almost acts like a thermal bridge if you like between this top piece which is called the IHS so we put a small ball in the middle then we grab the top of the heat sink and then obviously this will bridge that connection between the two remembering to screw down in a cross pattern which not only makes it easy but also applies even pressure so that thermal compound will spread evenly underneath our chip once you've done that final bit you should be able to pick it up with just the cooler I'm not going to say I recommend this cuz obviously if you haven't then you'll find everything will come off I've never done that before you will probably have [Music] probably but regardless plop that back down then obviously pick up the fan make sure it's blowing the way you actually want it to blow so here it's going into the cooler and then in theory out off the back and then with the clips just push that down into position then we have two cables one is this four pin fan header that is going to plug into CPU fan and then the other I think is going to daisy chain onto some of the others that we have over here allow me to kind of show you what I mean cuz we haven't actually showed you any of this case yet and we are now ready to go so this is the Corsair 3500x it's called X that means it has glass on the front that's their naming structure I've tweaked this ever so slightly by actually I can't remember if I turn these fans around or not I'm using them as an intake here I have made sure that I've Daisy chained them so that all of the RGB and all of the connections are kind of as out of sight as possible this is one of those ones I think it is a little bit overpriced personally for this case this particular one is okay you can get it for around about100 or so and it does come with three RGB fans but this is also the sort of chassis that you can often find in a sale so if you can do that definitely is going to be worth it but I would stay away from the IQ version of this because it's way more expensive and whilst the quality of the chassis is absolutely fine it's not like 14040 of dollars of chassis which is what they're charging is you're basically paying for the fans but otherwise surprisingly there's not really too much to say about this it didn't make my top cases list that I did last year if you want to see my favorite cases at every price point you can find that video in the top right corner of your screen we go through loads because this is as I say it's fine it doesn't really do anything drastically different it's not bad it it doesn't do more than it needs to and there are so many good chassis out there it's just a box with some glass on it really and technically all cases are like that but as I say doesn't really do anything to make itself stand out so let's drop this chassis down into position because this is a cheaper motherboard it does come with an IO Shield so please don't forget to actually push this into the back then you will need to grab yourself a bag of screws and it does come provided with the chassis but I could be going mad here so I don't I don't think I've lost I don't think you get one inside the box but if you do need to moove the standoffs from the case you can either use pliers to remove them so at the moment they're set up for a fulls size ATX motherboard but here we're using M or m8x so we need to plug in where it says M but some cases give you this little standoff removal tool which is really useful cuz you just drop this on top of your standoff and then it unscrews like that then you can pick up your motherboard and if you've done everything right it should line up with the io Shield at the back and then get this motherboard secured down oh and yes it does actually look as if my plan is going to work because what normally happens with motherboards like this is that if you use a fullsize ATX chassis the whole thing just has a load of cables coming up here and it doesn't always look as attractive as it should do whereas because we do have support for BTF motherboards or any motherboards that have those reverse connections we can actually kind of P for the holes that we have for those are illustrate this look with our RGB and that can connect like that then we do the same with our HD audio all of our easy chain fan speed our front panel block to actually get this thing to turn on and then hopefully our easier ones with our USB 3 then finally our USBC then you can give this thing a spin and there is just one more cable I think to plug in for now and that is our addressable RGB for the cooler this just Daisy change to the top fan and then when we give this a spin around you should see that actually for the most part our gaming PC is pretty much done it's literally just power supply and graphics card GPU should be pretty straightforward as we've already got this ready to go uh you will need to remove these slot covers but thankfully they are removable and replaceable let's pick up our Challenger GPU now shall we and then hopefully slide this right in clicks into position like that and yes okay it doesn't look the most balanced system in the world cuz again with a normal ATX motherboard this would be a slot lower but I think considering this is a more budget friendly system I still think this is going to look awesome and compared to so many that I've done on a shoestring budget not saying this is Sho string definitely not not but for a budget friendly gaming PC this is definitely one of the better looking ones I've built almost there then last piece of the puzzle the PSU power supply units and this is pretty much my go-to budget power supply we've talked about this loads of times on the channel before it's from MSI it's the mag a650 BN it's usually available for about £55 or dollars or so it's not the most fancy it's not the most efficient it's not even modular so you have all of these cables that kind of just like dangle here and if you don't need them you still have to put them inside your system but because it's only a 650 W unit you don't actually have that many cables to hide in the first place it still gives you load of expandability and more importantly really it works it functions and it gives you load of other money really to spend on other components in your system you're going to want to just drop this into your rig secure it down with the hex screws and then of course you will be left with all of these cables and it's important now to kind of you don't have to be like Mega tidy but just think about what you're doing before doing it don't have like B of things just tying themselves and a knot go for a short route and just as I say manage as you go really so this needs to go up at the top this is our eight pin CPU this goes up here at the top and then last but not least we do have these two8 pin power connections that are going to be used for the graphics card I think it's only a single eight pin though so that's why I've tied this up nice and neatly this can actually kind of go underneath and then up so this is what I mean about Tiding as you go don't cross over things without really thinking about what you're doing cuz it's just going to be a nightmare and you'll have a messy rig and the side panel won't necessarily close but to be fair that is one of the better things about this chassis you've got loads of room here for extra devices and just a kind of beit a little bit more untiy if you want to and that is going to be useful cuz don't forget we have all of these cables that we're not using now all of these SATA connections that we use for external things or internal things I should say like RGB hubs again but we can kind of just neatly fold this up a little bit and then just tuck that out of sight out of M it is just that single eight pin for the graphics card oh I haven't actually secured that down whoops make sure you secure your graphics card down or ATX our 8 Pin CPU there you have it as I say I'm actually pretty impressed this works it's literally just this little cable here that's not the most attractive thing in the world you'd get an extension if you really wanted to neaten it up but otherwise I think this is a fair bit of a showpiece build as I say on something that's a bit more affordable a budget friendly rig that's got plenty of glass with without any fast I see myself out oh I could have said glass without any ass so as I grab ourselves a monitor keyboard and mouse of course don't forget that if you do want to grab your very own PC Centric mouse mat I mean look how gorgeous this is the quality is I it's not to die for I would not die for my mous mat but it's an excellent mouse mat perfect size look for 10 keyless keyboards grab yours today link is down below and actually one other thing to mention that I really should have done when I was doing the build is don't forget that this motherboard does not have Wi-Fi there are modes that do just look for Wi-Fi in the name but obviously they are going to cost you a little bit more money and if you're going to use a wide connection anyway you don't need it necessarily right so this is the moment of truth I hear noise not seeing any RGB yet though oh the graphics card smells like almost smells sweet like a sweet shop what have they been manufacturing this card as this is AMD I'd say allow up to like 60 seconds 2 minutes and if you don't see anything that's when you can panic but that's what I want to see splash screen press delete or press y to reset firmware TPM cuz I've used this board before yes that is what it's all about and we've even got RGB let's take a proper look at this I think this looks really good how about that everyone I know this is not the absolute cheapest budget PC we've ever done on this channel but again this has so much potential because you can of course upgrade it it's got that 7600 you can go to a 9 series or future AMD CPU if you want we've got 650 power supply so you want to upgrade this to like a blackw GPU or something in the future I'm not saying it's going to be ideal but the point is this is such a great platform to build upon and it's such a great looking PC whilst relatively speaking not costing an absolute ton it's a bit loud actually at its default settings but obviously we can tune that in the bias don't be too alarmed by this it's not as scary as it used to be I mean this is actually quite nicely laid out essentially what we you want to do is go down to where it says XMP Expo profile and you want to enable that just so we're getting the full rated speed of the ram but if that doesn't work and the thing starts boot looping that's when you use that clear seos I was going to say switch some motherboards have a switch that clear seos header on the motherboard remember with the screwdriver do that and then obviously you can uh just disable that if it doesn't work but that's going to give you a faster memory speed then we can go into smart fan 6 the main thing really is that it's quite heavily weighted here on the left hand side which means that the CPU doesn't have to be that hot for the fan to spin up so I'm going to set a more conservative graph and then I'm going to do the same with our other fans and of course if you haven't already you will need to grab yourselves a copy of Windows this is Windows 11 and you'll just want to whack that in the back it will automatically load into the windows installer there you can just follow the onscreen instructions get yourself logged in and you should be pretty much set up and ready to go so just give me a couple hours get all of our drivers all of our games installed and uploaded and we can test some performance oh and ladies and gentlemen this wouldn't be a PC Centric video without getting very confused and a few things happening and weird stuff uh I start by saying that as I say actually I really think that the look of this system is very very good for something in this caliber only thing I'll say is that I ended the last bit didn't I by saying I wouldn't change anything and I really would I think this is kind of like the final strike for me on the crucial P3 plus when I'm downloading everything at the same time the whole system it's it's not that it locks up it just like 100% And it's just waiting on the SSD and bear in mind you could spend like an extra10 OD dollars on something like a Lexar NM 790 and in theory you'd get uh better performance I think that would be worth doing cuz it's annoying to go and build all of this and then let the SSD actually be the bottleneck only other thing to note as well is do bear in mind that there's no recording still annoyingly on this uh GPU and in this current version of the arc software it will be coming but in the meantime if you want to do what we're doing here today then you are going to have to use OBS so let's jump in arguably with the hardest test actually and we're going to start off with some Star Wars Outlaws and yes I know still isn't everyone's cup of tea yes I know I still haven't progressed the game and this is currently set to the low preset but do not let that deceive you because this is still a very very intense game cuz rate tracing is actually kind of baked into this game you cannot turn it off and this is where I think the art cards are definitely going to come in handy because they are actually clearly able to cope with it I mean we're getting around about 80 FPS or so with this turned on so you can have a look inside and you've got all of lovely fog you can just see this is an incredibly realistic scene and it's something that not a lot of games manage to pull off quite like this I'm always very very impressed actually when I fire this up in terms of the visuals and the fact that at 1440 p on the cheapest new graphics card really uh that you can buy is what 78 FPS or so I think that is very very impressive and if you have a look at our frame time graph this is the bit that kind of dictates exactly how smooth it is or at least it represents how smooth the game is and this is not what we were getting when we did our even cheaper rig with that Intel CPU and very very cheap motherboard now turning this down to 1080P and now you can see you're getting a really nice high refresh rate experience again especially if you have adaptive sync this is what you want from a brand new gaming PC and this is what Arc is all about when it works properly and again remember my initial experiences with the b58 weren't great but glad to say so far so good haven't run into any of those same issues or new issues with this particular b570 and of course remember that this is supposed to be a next Generation title I know this hasn't sold very well I know you might not like this game but this is a great example of really of what we have now and what should be coming in the not too distant future from most AAA releases and the fact that we can run this at 1080p at 100 FPS with rate racing turned on is what you want from a new GPU but moving across from a game that not Everyone likes to one I think is very well- loved this of course is some cyber Punk we have this set at xss quality we do have this running at 1440p and the preset is high no rate racing at the moment and as you can see this is a great experience we're currently getting around about 78 to 82 FPS or so and this is basically what I'd almost call like the pure experience I mean not everyone is going to want to use xss but realistically any upscaler especially if you have a high resolution monitor at this level I would definitely highly recommend that you do try it I'm not saying you should use it especially at 1080p but 1440p it is definitely going to be worth using in a game like this where you do need to use a bit of AI just to give yourself a little bit more of an edge but I am interested in what happens if we turn xcss off cuz as I say not everyone is going to want to do that and what has that done to the frame rate well obviously as expected it has lowered it down we're now looking at call it 60 FPS but it is slightly lower we set it again to Quality and then we'll scroll down and find rray tracing and we'll turn just the reflections on for now let's not go too crazy I just want to see what that does to the frame rate so we did have about 90 or so before didn't we uh but yeah you can see it's pretty much actually the same as it was without ra tracing but without any AI whatsoever right so by using that upscaler you've essentially allowed yourself to get the r racing as well and there's no doubt about it that the game definitely looks better with the reflections but it's one of those things that you kind of want to be able to use all of it to get the most out of it let's try Ultra quality cuz this is 1080p so obviously our resolution was a little bit more reduced yeah that that does look better but it's not night and day to be honest actually interestingly our frame rate is pretty much staying the same I'm wondering whether our bottleneck is actually from the ray tracing portion now but ladies and gentlemen I now think it's time to move on to my favorite bit of these videos the bit that really matters the multiplayer experience and as you can see this is some Apex Legends we got the set to high I was going to say the high preset there aren't really presets with this High settings across the board I've manually changed it the only thing that is set to ultra are the textures cuz we obviously have the uh the 8 GB or the 10 GB of vram needed for this in this particular particular instance you can see we're using around about 7 Gig of vram but yeah our frame rate is around about 150 FPS so that is not too shabby whatsoever especially again bear in mind we are running this at 1440p interestingly enough it doesn't seem as if our frame rate has actually increased that much we've gone up to about 160 or so and again this is one of the frustrations that you will find with Arc it's either a blessing or a curse depending on the resolution that you play at because it seems that there's not often that much difference between 1440 and 1080 I don't know whether it's an architecture thing optimization but this is one of the things we've consistently seen since the original Arc gpus launched if if your glass half full let's just go with you get better 1440p uh than you had expect oh well ladies and gentlemen after what has to be around about 15 minutes or so for the game to actually load all of the textures again you only need to do this uh once and what you're seeing now is some Halo infinite and again this is one of those games that doesn't actually have that much uh scaling technology what what it does have seems to work quite well the internal just resolution slider upscales it quite nicely so this is actually a 4k monitor so this looks arguably a lot better than just normal 1440p will but as you can see the frame rate we're getting isn't as high as it is in Apex Legends around about 60 FPS or so but I really do want to see what happens if we turn this down to 1080p now it's another one of those scenarios where the frame rate at 1080p doesn't go up as dramatically as you would usually expect if you are a big halo infinite fan I probably would turn some of the settings down a little bit more just to get the absolute best out of this but I mean I don't think High settings is unreasonable for this is it this is almost more what I would have expected just in general from a budget for any gaming PC right 1080p 1440p probably between 60 and 100 FPS but we have excelled really across the board at pretty much everything that we have played now here's the thing this is Arc so it is going to be more prone to issues than Nvidia cards and AMD but as we've already mentioned I haven't really come across any issues other than just like a really annoyingly slow inore of the driver the fact that you can't uh actually record your Gameplay at the moment but I know that most people probably don't really care about either of those things in the gram scheme of things so actually if you are looking to build a budget fry gaming PC in 2025 then I think the b570 definitely should be on your radar as long as you can get it for that price my fear is that this is going to be overinflated with the third party coolers and things and if they're in high demand then will be paying a little bit more than they need to but I'd love to hear your thoughts on this what do you make of our GPU what do you make of our

ridiculous over the top Overkill gaming PC we've ever constructed on this channel it all starts with this the brand new RX 5090 and this one is the most over the- top one you can get pretty much this is the MSI Supreme liquid so it comes with a freaking 360 Radiator on it we've got a Godlike motherboard and just everything really is going to be the absolute top of the top best of the best and it is going to cost a lot we're going to have a little money counter at the bottom left hand corner of the screen all the way throughout this video so if you want to explore what endless funds can get you then this is the video for you as always we're going to be walking you through all the components and everything that we have in here showing you how to construct it and then of course at the end not only showing you how beautiful this thing is hopefully going to look but also those all important gameplay Benchmark numbers so you can see what the most Overkill gaming PC will actually be able to deliver when it comes to Raw FPS I assure you ladies and gentlemen that this thing is going to be pretty spectacular so roll down your windows I was going to say if you're watching this in a car and buckle your seat bels because this is going to be a pretty awesome ride all that's left to say is a massive thank you to you guys for watching but also to MSI for apparently sponsoring this video Let's waste no time though and get started with the bit that you're no doubt most interested in what has to be the most Overkill graphics card ever this is the 5090 this specific one of course is the Supreme liquid you can buy an airod version of this that is still called the supreme but obviously that does not come with the 360 rad and that is going to reduce The Thermals that you've got reduce the amount of noise I've actually order used this one if you want to see like a head-to-head versus the founders Edition and a different one from a different aib you can find that in the top rank corner of your screen but I think you agree it's a really attractive GPU especially if you're going to put this in a vertical GPU Mount it's kind of exactly what I want I want something that's almost like reminiscent of the founders Edition from 20 Series right I think that was kind of like Peak graphics cards for me in terms of like Simplicity and just that kind of metal look and they've definitely recreated it here and I really really like that you all have to obviously be aware that whilst it's a smaller GPU than some of its competition obviously you've got quite a bit of extra height here so if you're going to put this in a specific case where you can fit a 360 and maybe a smaller card do bear that in mind but obviously that is only half the equation because also Inside the Box you do get the 360 rad as well I have changed this round so you can see the fan labels if you use this as an intake and have the fans on top but if you're using this as an exhaust or you've just got load of options really uh then you don't have to see the labels I'll point that out there now cuz that was something that I noted in my previous video that's a little bit annoying but you should be able to get around that in a normal chassis and it wouldn't normally be so boring but I do also want to shout out the fact that MSI do give you one of their yellow tipped power adapter cables inside the box which is a nice touch cuz essentially it just increases the safety not only does it look like some of these pins are a little bit further forward so compared to 40 series the adapter you get inside the box is going to be a little bit safer but also with this yellow connection it just enables you to see whether you have fully inserted this if you can see any yellow you know it's got a little bit more distance to go in I will say that this is different though to the one that you'll get with the founders Edition and to be honest with you neither of them are perfect because this one is short but at least it is so short that you kind of just tuck it there like that and that goes to the graphics card whereas with this it's longer which is good but then I find it's still not long enough so where you've got that little cable management section at the bottom of your case you then can have to try and put depending on whether it's a 5090 or 80 three of these in this tiny little hole and it's still not ideal so personally next gen I want to see a longer adapter than this with like the yellow tips of this blend them together with polymerization that would be perfect but let's carefully place our graphics card down for a second cuz we know what I'm like and I do not want to knock that off of our desk cuz it' be a very expensive mistake and instead let's actually start our build and I want to say that in all my years of building PCS I don't think I've ever actually used msis top of the top they're Godlike range so if you were to say what features does this have the answer would be yes it's ridiculous all over the top and actually it looks very tasteful now obviously it is eatx so extended ATX so you do need to make sure your case does have a little bit extra length there just to be able to support it but this does up to four M do this does up to to four m.2 P Gen 5 ssds the way it does that is two native slots on the board itself and it does come with a p Gen 5 cards that will go into this lower slot and then you'll get two M do2s from that and you do have an additional two I believe Gen 4 slots as well so six SSD slots in total loads of IO as well I mean look at all those USB C's look at that I mean I use a lot of USBC I think the most I ever use at one time is four but here we're clearly covered with five plus another two seven obviously loads of usba as well you've got Wi-Fi you've got 10 gig networking and five so maybe if you want to like hard wire into a Nas connect to a 5 gig local network or something you can do all of that at the same time and I've got to say actually that I do like the way that this motherboard has been laid out everything seems to come off completely tesslyn this shroud so you don't actually have to kind of see anything really you think if you went for like project zero where everything's reversable like you plug it all around the back but you need a case that supports that and obviously that then cre a load a mess around the other side which is good and bad at the same time whereas if you go for something like this where all of the cables are pretty much just going to go through one hole here you kind of create the same effect without specifically needing a BTF case which is quite nice here you can see all of those M do2s five native on the board itself oh wow okay that's a lot bigger than I thought okay and it's got a fan on it as well this is like an old school graphics card isn't it this is your PCI card for those additional five M do2s oh and look it's Tallis you just flip these up and then pull them out and then you put your drive in there that's pretty cool okay it's not completely tallus you do still need a screwdriver to get into this but that's not bad is it but let's place our board back down into position and then pick up the CPU and I will say that if I was filming this in a couple of months time when we've almost certainly got the release of the 9950 x3d that would obviously be the perfect companion for this cuz it's going of like the most Overkill CPU for gaming and productivity but in the meantime you're going to have the fastest gaming CPU you can get this is the ryzen 7 9800 x3d it's eight cores but it excels at everything gaming really it's it's pretty ridiculous availability in the states is still not fantastic but it should get better over time though because obviously we've just had the release of new graphics cards especially the 5090 that does kind of need a 9800 x3d CU it is still going to bottleneck even with this in certain titles certain settings and certain resolutions but it is almost certainly going to be the best choice unless you specifically need loads of CES then obviously you could just go for the normal 950x and you can actually use MS size bios as well to turn on like a gaming specific mode so especially if you do have a high core count chip this can essentially help you eek more performance out of it when you need it next up we're going to go for our SSD and I must admit we're letting the side down a little bit with this this is relatively inexpensive compared to everything else cuz the version I've got here is the one tbte but obviously if we were going pure Overkill you go for the 4 terabyte now admittedly this is pretty much at the limit of pide generation 4 but I must admit I must admit that I have actually forgot to take this little p peel off that would have been embarrassing yes this is not PCI generation 5 but it is at the limit of Gen 4 and for gaming this is still more than you need really and you're not going to essentially really see any difference at the moment because the load speeds if you do have a game that has direct storage is so quick anyway that if there was going to be a difference you'd be talking like milliseconds rather than seconds right so personally I would advise going for a super fast drive but rather than go for Gen 5 at the moment go for a higher capacity which is probably going to be more useful now the next piece of our delightfully expensive puzzle is going to be our memory or RAM and Corset Dominator pretty much does fit the bill every time because it is very very Overkill but it's just so beautiful as well you can get different tops for these as well so if you wanted to even like 3D print something to your exact specification then you can do that with this that's why it's a little bit like extra on the top you can take this a little bit off go for something Slimmer something different as I say it depends what you want to get really but realistically in terms of specifications I know it's over 7,000 7,000 800 MHz of pure Ram performance I don't know how much difference again that's actually going to make in the real world especially on AMD but one of the big advantages of going for x870 is that it should support faster memory speed so I really wanted to kind of push this to the Limit because if you are going for Godlike board that's probably what you're going to want to try and do in terms of capacity as well this is 48 gig rather than 32 32 is still more than you need for a gaming PC but obviously 48 gives you that little bit extra without the extra cost associated with 64 but maybe 48 gig of RAM is an insult for this Overkill gaming PC now moving on to our next component I must admit I'm still a little bit confused about what's going to be best because I did have an idea to use an air cooler because ID calling sent out one of their golden edition ranges and I really thought that this might work because obviously we have black and gold accents on this but I can't bring myself to use an air cooler on something this high end even though I think it's going to match perfectly once you put it on you're going to have to have an extra fan here or here and I just think it's going to ruin the aesthetic but I still want to use the fans that they sent out because they're not RGB but they have this lovely gold ring along the top and the sides and I think this really is perfectly going to go with the rest of the components and it's just going to give us a more tasteful looking PC really because we've got the wood at the front as I say we've got gold accents throughout I think this will kind of let like the components do the talking rather than just RGB ifying everything so what I'm going to do is go for the best looking cooler when it comes to the pump head that still has fantastic performance but rather unusually we're going to take all of the RGB fans off and replace them as I say it's it's not normal but I want to create something that as I say is RGB less really and it's just really tasteful but let's prepare our CPU socket by removing the default am5 mounting hardware then place our am5 spaces on top place the AMD standoffs in the hole and then screw those down and now that we have prepared our socket I believe we are now ready to actually move on and talk about the chassis and I've got to say when I first did a live stream with this so if you want to see like a full build without any edits at all you can find that in the topand corner of your screen but when we first did a build with this I kind of put it in the live stream because this is from a company called &x and the previous one that they did was decent but it was kind of unremarkable and I thought that it would be a similar story with this but it really wasn't I love this it's got a really boring name it's called the V1 but it's kind of like a mix of all of the best cases out there right so it's like a mixture of height fractal with the wood that you have on the front it's got a bit of NZ XT it doesn't come with any fans it's available for roughly £50 here in the UK but it's just so easy to build in it's got fantastic air flow and it just looks the business I think it looks absolutely fantastic with this kind of like hybrid black and white finish it's great in case you hadn't already noticed by the way this is a dual chamber chassis so you've got a little bit of ventilation there your power supply is going to fit in this space up here I don't think this does actually support reverse connection motherboards which is a downside but I mean look at this you've got this little CAD look that you can put ssds and stick things on and then you can just remove it when you're building it if it gets in the way that's a nice touch you got loads of space down here four larger power supplies and loads of bits and Bobs and I mean obviously you've got the woods bit on the front that comes off testly as well it's just everything really that you'd want for a pretty decent price for something highend but let's pick up our absolute unit of a motherboard and drop this down into position once you have got your motherboard fitted and screwed down though it should start to resemble something like this so you can see you have a little bit of overhang here but it's still kind of tin in and looks quite nice some of the issues that you find with some like dual chamber cases especially ones that have this bit of edge here is that then can look a little bit weird when you come around to the other side but actually I think because the iio is on here and your cables are all going to be going there anyway I don't think that's going to be too obvious and I want to do something I wouldn't usually do and that's a bit of a test fit here because I want to work out where is going to be best to have all of the tubes and where is obviously going to be best to mount the radiator for this so let's drop our 5090 in for now and then this can either go at the top like that or at the side not optimal for longevity but obviously you could have that down the bottom like that if I did have a criticism of this it's not only that you can see the labels but they kind of daisy chain together with this proprietary cable and if they gave you like an adapter or something or it was just more mainstream so you could swap out the fans a lot easier that would be more appreciated I mean let's grab our Kraken Elite and work out where that can go obviously we'll have fan on there as well okay so it doesn't actually look like we can do two 360 RADS without having these clearance issues so one of them is going to have to go down the bottom annoyingly well it's not quite working out how I want it but I think I've got the best all around compromise we can't do push pull because it's not going to be physically enough room there the irony is if this was not an eatx motherboard and you didn't have the extra block there you would be able to fit some fans in but as you're going to have to put the cables for power supply and stuff in anyway here even if you could physically fit it they' probably just just end up getting in the fans and you wouldn't get that much extra air flow so I'm going to leave it like this we can't then fit three fans down the bottom because of these tubes but I should be able to fit two fans down here the problem I was having was the coil essentially of the tubing because if you do it any other way all of the tube is just kind of there and it's all you're going to see so even though this has less stuff in it when it comes to other fan RGB or the gold that we have on these particular ones you're going to see less of that but you're going to see a lot less tubing which I think is going to work out and be more beneficial oh of course it is the gold is only on that side and if I'm going to use it as an intake I'll see that side it's going as an exhaust then I really starting to think that maybe I made the wrong decision and should have just gone with a air cooler because it's not going to look how I wanted it but again this is just the issue with having two sets of tubes it is difficult to make it look really really good I think it's going to be okay but I've discovered something else as well and again you guys are not going to like this one bit and that is if you have that radiator at the front you're not going to be able to fit a fan there which is a real shame so we're going to have to just do two fans it will be all right but I think you're just going to have to agree that you'd need a bigger case if you really wanted to pull off what we're trying to do here or obviously use an air caller or go for the Supreme air version and then you wouldn't have any of this issue and you could have the gold fans everywhere two radiators I hate radiators I think we're now ready to actually get this installed though and we do have some thermal compound pre-applied on this so this can literally just go no no it can't remove the default Intel back plate get the AMD one drop that into position and then this just literally pushes on top big massive nuts big massive nuts secure with a screwdriver then we can start grabbing all of our cables remembering to connect the fans that were on the radiator to the NZXT system so we can control that in the software and again plugging all of these things in the irony is that it would probably be a bit easier normally but because we have this whack and great radiator there actually trying to get everything plugged in here is a bit tricky but definitely doable certainly not the absolute quickest build that we've ever done on the channel then but it is now coming along all we need to do is actually plug the power supply in I believe and then we are done I've been quite smart as well because again the ugly bit is always going to be these tubes here and my idea was to kind of get them to fall directly below the power supply cable so that when we plug our graphics card in it's hiding the cable that is going to be there anyway no matter what right so try to have big brain energy there but moving on to the last and certainly the heaviest component I think of our build here today we have our power supply this is the AI 1600t PCI Gen 5 again definition of overkill on this one this one can actually Supply PCI generation 5 on two different ports and you've got that lovely gold finish on the top as well looks great MSI stick with that I'm hoping that the cables in this as well are pretty decent cuz obviously this is an expensive bit of Kit and if you have to go out and buy extra cables as well well that's just going to be a huge disappoint appointment but no we do have lovely braided cables here none of that horrible rubber or mesh netting stuff that you find on cheaper supplies this is good to go out of the box Overkill but very future proof and because this is dual chamber look we don't actually need to preit the cables we can screw that down now and then we can start connecting our cables and you might be wondering why anyone would need a 1600 W power supply well MSI is aiming this obviously for gamers but then also anyone that's going to basically have two 90s in a single system use it for productivity AI systems anything like that really you can cover it with one PSU which is not an easy feat and then because I have already done the graphics card which as I say just plugs in nice and neatly we need a little bit of kind of cable tying and stuff around the back as you can see I haven't done any yet uh but you do have actually that does look like quite a lot you do have some cable tie points so you can get it down like that and then obviously you're going to put the side panel on and you've got that little door that you can place here to kind of keep everything at Bay so it's going to be an easy one to manage actually and obviously the most important bit is the main chamber that you can see so without knowing whether it works it's not been the easiest build but I think considering everything and what we're trying to achieve basically just by hiding that extra cable I think this is one of the best looking jobs you could do but what would you change let us know down in the comments below let's see if this works oh i' have just realized you know what I could have done that would have probably made this a lot easier I could have had the fans behind this bit of wood and then had the whole thing back a bit and probably either fit some extra fans in there or at least just giv ourselves a little bit more room I mean it's fine I'm not going to change it now but I didn't realize how much room there was here well at as you guys know big shout out by the way to MSI for actually sending out their new 27 in QD OLED 4K 240 HZ monitor because we did have their 32 but it was just too big to kind of make these videos with whereas with the smaller 27 it fits on the desk as well as me do remember of course as well that we are not expecting loads of RGB we've made that decision consciously we're going for full tasteful have we done it oh I haven't got a display port that' be bad trying again we got some action oh the ram looks cool doesn't it oh there we go I was getting worried then I was like oh it's it's not done it it's taken too long but there it is new CPU installed that is some relief cuz I've spent a long time on this build but the big question is is it going to take our XMP settings profile one 7800 MHz maybe it's thinking about it I think we've done it how about that and just like that everyone here we are all set up and ready to go and I must admit the PC's come out well but not quite how I'd like it I think actually if if you're very very creative then you may well be able to move the radiator back and then still enable you to actually have three fans on the all-in-one just because it will open up a little bit of room it's going to depend on the fans that you use and the problem is and the reason I haven't done it here is because the cable that actually connects the fans to the radiator on the all-in-one for the graphics card it's so small and so thin and all the fans kind of daisy chain together it's actually not going to be very easy to do this you can just be aware that I would have preferred a more open standard really without having to use adapters or trying to like I don't know sold of fan cables and stuff to get together that would be pretty annoying because actually I think the best solution would have been to use the lean Lee Wireless fans you can find a full video about this in the top R corner of your screen because these all sync together and they look very tasteful but then they also have great performance and you could set them up to be gold fans and they come in Reverse blade so I think actually for the all outmost Overkill PC that's probably the route I would go down I do also want to draw your attention to the fact that I have actually attached a fan at the back as an intake it looks okay but it it doesn't look as highend as I think the system should as a result you can see the logo but that's just to give our CP caller just a little bit of fresh air just to make sure that our temperatures going to come down and we're going to have bit noise and Acoustics and things obviously the wood effect as well looks absolutely fantastic but you're only really going to see that in the b-roll because it's the other side of the PC it's got the same problem that the H6 had where it looks great but it's only at the right angles and you don't often see that cuz it's on the other side of your desk but anyway let's jump into some games and what you're saying here is something a little bit different this is Hitman and the reason I wanted to show this is cuz it's a fantastic looking game it is something a little bit different but then also it's on nvidia's very limited list at the moment of games that support DSS multiframe generation there's 75 games I believe at the time of filming but most of those aren't really games I'd want to play so trying to look for something a bit different to spice this video up this was essentially the best we could do but you can see at the moment running this at DSS quality so you definitely could turn this down to balanced or performance uh and we're getting around about 103 FPS at Absolute Max settings we have all of those lovely rate race Reflections and full I don't think it's full path racing in this but it's definitely like some pretty highend rate racing it looks really good actually the implementation is nice here you can see the tattoo on the back of the head in all of its detail but yes let's actually show you how the frame generation Works uh we go into the options menu we show you the settings that we have so as you can see everything is turned up to Max or Ultra but this is the setting I want to turn on DS frame generation so I'm sure you've heard this a million times but just in case you're not familiar essentially what this does is use the graphics card to render frames and then every other frame from the third frame onwards is then going to be an AI generated frame so this is only useful if you have a monitor refresh rate that is going to actually exceed the frame rate of the game so let's say you've got this one which is QD OLED 240 HZ if you're getting 160 FPS and you could turn that into 240 great but if you have 160 FPS turn it into 240 and you've only got 165 HZ display then you wouldn't want to turn frame generation on because your monitor would then be served up AI frames when it could be served rendered frames and you can get some weird artifacts and things the smoothing only works if you have a highend monitor and as you can clearly see at the moment this has made quite a dramatic difference our frame rate has gone to 150 FPS or 141 and because we've got that 240 HZ display using multiframe generation in theory is going to help us just to get a little bit extra smoothness to the image and because you're seeing 240 like hurts anyway you're kind of just filling in like the blank spaces that you wouldn't otherwise have any information so as long as there aren't any obvious artifacts it is going to be worth using providing your latency is good so my magic formula is as long as the PC latency is below 55 milliseconds in a single player game then you are going to have a good experience but this is one of the games that you have to use the Nvidia override in the Nvidia app to actually get working so let's stop this recording we remember we're getting about 140 FPS then we will open up the Nvidia app we will scroll down to where it says Graphics here we have all of our games and you can use the Nvidia control panel Nvidia app to optimize everything if you want takes the fun out of it but if you're new to PC gaming not going to be a bad option but it shows you everything you've got here and what they say is going to be recommended but what we want to do is scroll all the way down to where it says driver settings and then here we can find DSS override and you've got a few different settings and things essentially so you can actually change it from default to latest and if there's a Transformer model uh for the dlss which is going to be higher quality but comes with a slight latency well slight performance penalty you can turn that on or you can do it based on the setting that you want to change essentially so you've got three frame gen Ray reconstruction and super resolution so I want to change this to latest to make sure we're getting the the best version of DSs essentially and then where it says frame generation or actually latest I thought it was going to give you all of those different options maybe it's under here yes okay here it is so the default would be 2X or you can change it to 3x or 4X 4X is going to give you the highest possible frame rate but remember because this is a 240 HZ display there's no pointless using Forex which is going to have three AI generated frames cuz that is going to take us over the frame rate of the monitor itself so let's change this to 3x and then we can return to the game and indeed you can see that our frame rate has now increased quite dramatically to around about 220 to 2 40 250 FPS which is going to be perfect for this monitor CU you want it to stay just below the frame rate ideally to get the smoothest most fluid experience without as I say seeing any of those AI frames unnecessarily right and rather interestingly as well our PC latency has actually improved and you might be thinking oh well that's cuz the frame rate's increased no don't forget that the AI generated frames don't actually do anything to the latency other than Theory slightly increase it I think this is actually because we've now changed the latest version of the models for frame gen which is supposed to cut down our latency a little bit which would make sense because whilst we're now injecting an extra AI frame we are getting lower latency because of that new algorithm so that is pretty cool as well obviously it is going to depend on a game by- game basis so your results definitely will vary and in terms of the amount of artifacts and things that you're going to see again it depends on the type of game so Hitman is very slow paced so you're very unlikely to see any like horrible nasties and things unless they're particularly obvious but if you're playing something maybe like a racing game or a lot of stuff is just kind of going on the screen and the algorithm can't kind of interject all those frames properly then that's when you're going to start to see some problems but I just wanted to illustrate for you essentially what multiframe gent is going to do and when you'd want to use it because if you set this to 4X and you're getting over 300 something FPS then your experience would actually be worse by setting it to 2x or 3x all depends on your monitor's refresh rate but that's how to enable it let's now press on to our next title shall we with this being some Allen wake 2 and this is a game that pretty much comes with all of the bells and whistles right so we got this set to 4K everything Max other than R tracing which is off entirely our deals is set to balance and we are using that new model now this is a game that has it all built in natively so you don't have to muck around with having well you using that Nvidia app everything is pretty much there and ready to go and at the moment we're getting a frame rate for around about 120 FPS so not too bad this is definitely one of those games that is ridiculously intense even without the r racing turned on when it's turned up to Max so I would actually advise turning the DSs down to Performance this is the way that I played through but that was actually with the older model as well which gave you better performance but came at the cost of image quality which is kind of like the wrong trade-off so I'd actually rather go uh maybe from dlss balanced now down to Performance because the model is better so you should get better image quality anyway right it's it's worth experimenting with so just to illustrate this point point if we go into the options menu you can change this down to Performance and then when this flicks down you should see that our frame rate has increased not actually as dramatically as I would have thought interestingly enough our GP load is definitely oh we've got some weird stutter there what's going on what's going on our PC is having a freak out it doesn't like it I think we're back I think it was just having a weird moment let's now turn on our ra tracing let's go with high I think this might topple it but then it's a 50/90 so it shouldn't do and what difference has that made to the frame rate not actually anywhere near as much as I would have thought I mean this is obviously one of the main advantages of this generation well certainly on the 50 Series it didn't make as much difference in the 5080 as we would have liked but the idea is that the overhead has been reduced because you've got better tensor cors better RT calls so you can turn all the bells and whistles on without it affecting your frame rate quite so much and bear in mind we're not actually using frame gen a PC latency of around about 34 milliseconds and 90 FPS that is pretty darn tasty actually what if we go absolute m Max that's Ultra and the latest version of this game as well I believe uses the mega geometry technique which essentially is just going to give you better performance I think that's the main difference maybe in the future it's going to give you lot higher quality models as well but essentially trying to R race unreal 5 with all of the nanite stuff is very very hard and very complex and their technology aims to give you better visuals but mainly better performance really in those scenarios so that is what it's trying to do in Allan Wake obviously that has reduced the frame rate a little bit a bit further down now latency of around about 40 whether you can notice a difference especially during normal gameplay not entirely sure but you can definitely see just how good looking this game is but this is another one of the new ctes that does come with frame generation interestingly enough though because there's so much foliage in this it's one of those games that I personally turned off when I was playing the game I haven't really tested it on 50 Series though so I can't comment so much but I have seen that Hardware unbox commented definitely a lot around like the edges of the flashlight and things so hopefully it can improve over time but if you did need extra frame rate that you can set that to dlss frame gen 2X and then that increases our frame rate to about 130 140 if we go to 3x so now two AI generated frames we've boosted that to 205 FPS our latency has gone up to 44 but this still feels pretty decent you can notice the difference to be fair it's not quite as slick as it was but again in a slower pce game like this that should be absolutely L you can notice that it does start to fall apart when you wiggle it quite a lot though yeah like do you see what I mean you can see those artifacts around the flashlight and then last but not least let's go for 4X so if you had a 4K 360 HZ monitor this clearly would be the optimum setup but now we are pretty much saturating our display I mean to be fair actually you could use it on this because it is still hovering around about 240 250 FPS I'd probably leave it a 3X personally uh but our latency is still a decent decent chunk under 55 so not bad but yeah you might start to run into some artifacting and things so just pick the settings that work optimally for you really but if you want to play Allen wake clearly the 5090 is the best card to do on but of course ladies and gentlemen I know we justest about it but we have been testing cyberpunk now for like four years on Nvidia builds but because they keep changing the game that is why we keep using it and today is no different so this is currently the new Transformer model of dlss which as I say looks a lot better full path tracing which is why the game looks absolutely ridiculous I mean it's kind of cheating when you have it on a QD OLED monitor as well cuz that really does do like the remaining 30 40% of the visuals if you're looking just to do an upgrade to your system then actually grabbing an OLED monitor would probably be my be my first part call if your frame rate you're already getting is like decent enough but anyway back to the game around about 90 FPS or so with that highest level of path tracing DSS set to Performance but because we do have that new model the image quality is definitely improved on what it was before so I would say especially on a 27in monitor this is pretty much compromise free really when it comes to image quality but this is without frame generation so our latency at the moment is 28 milliseconds and FPS is 89 and then as we restart the title annoyingly in a slightly different area but maybe we get to the same bit you can see that our frame rate has obviously increase now to about 155 153 FPS and crucially that latency again hasn't really changed that dramatically we've added an extra 5 milliseconds or so here we're now looking at about 33 35 Ms so not even close most to a problem in cyber Punk even with all of that path tracing is pretty remarkable but because obviously we do have the latest version of frame gen then we find frame gen we turn that to 3x and one of the problems that you will find as you sort of crank the amount of frames that you have up is that if there are going to be any issues with artifacts you then get artifacts on the artifact so it kind of makes it a little bit more obvious but yes around about 211 FPS at the moment as we enter a little bit more of a demanding bit of the game and because that is obviously 40 FPS under the frame rate that we have on our well refresh rate that we have on our monitor again this is probably going to be optimal but just for due diligence change it to 4X now this is going to be three AI generated frames so it doesn't feel like soup I mean actually that that that feels pretty good and it's not particularly obvious but depending on how contrasty the scene is it can start to kind of fall apart so you can see it there it just ends up being a bit of a contrasty mess if you kind of well when you put it a 4X as I say it's a lot more obvious than it would be 2x or 3x but you can break it if you want to you just got to hope that the game you're playing doesn't make you break it so you see those art effects I'm making it sound more confusing than it should be but ladies and gentlemen moving on to the final game in our tests we have probably the most demanding of the lot actually this of course is Indiana Jones and the great circle I have started playing it which is why we are actually in a little bit more of a different scene rather than just the same start of the game that you've probably seen over and over again I mean just look how realistic that is that is absolutely saying I would say that quite often especially with like the facial animations and stuff we're properly into uncal uncal uncanny valley here cuz it looks so realistic but something's not quite right sometimes but I'm not getting that from the environments literally just from the faces and things I you can see the lighting here is just so realistic it's very very cool this is absolute Max settings so Supreme Everything full path tracing interestingly enough though we don't actually have our frame generation enabled and at the moment we're getting around about 95 FPS so this is the way I would choose to play it cuz i' would probably play it on a 4K TV 120 FPS but obviously you've got your frame gen as well and once again you can use that Nvidia override so that's actually what we've done I've set this to use the latest version of uh Transformer DSS and of course the latest version of frame gen but I will say that I did notice some weird artifacts actually with the Transformer model which means that I might turn this back off I'm not 100% sure if that's what's causing it though which is weird but every now and then like there's just some weirdness in this particular game and in the cut scenes I was getting like bits of blue stripes like either side this is why I wanted to test it again anyway to see if it was definitely the issue but this is why you have to do it in the app at the moment because it's not native because they want you to turn it on yourself and then if you know that's the issue you can roll it back essentially but let's turn on our frame gen and see if that actually changes anything here it is DS say frame gen remember this is just on off cuz we've used the override to essentially change it but at the moment we haven't actually changed the amount of frames that it is going to pump out just the model that it uses so there we are about 145 FPS or so and obviously you could boost that in the app if you wanted to change that nearer the 200 FPS Mark which is probably what you'd want to do on this particular monitor but is this enough of a reason to go for 50 Series in my opinion not really like if you have a 4090 I don't think I would be making the upgrade to the 5090 unless I was like proper die hard on everything PC gaming or I needed 32 GB of vram or if you specifically do have monitor like this and you do want to be maxing it out all of the time obviously that is going to make sense cuz that's where frame gen or multiframe gen definitely comes in handy is is filling out a monitor like this but it's obviously a lot of money to spend so the question goes out to you guys on this what do you think of the 590 I know availability isn't great but if you could get hold of one is that something you'd want to do uh before I leave you I do want to give you a quick thermal and acoustic test so in terms of temperatures 53 52° on the graphics card which is ridiculous but when you have a 360s an intake uh that's why you'd want to go for this version the whole thing is whisper quiet uh CPU thermals not so good though 68° absolutely fine during gaming but when you're doing like shade of pre-caching or loading or stuff like that it does shoot up to about 96 the system gets very loud so clearly you could optimize this a lot lot better for thermals when it comes to the CPU so that's something I'll leave you guys with but here's your noise test you know as close to silent really as you can get which is absolutely insane but overall I think the system looks great but there is a little bit of work to be done to make this as perfect as I know eventually could be with some tweaking but as I say question goes out to you guys so let me know your thoughts on this down in the comment section below smash the like

It's going to be awesome for maximizing bang for buck. It can do ray tracing. It has brand new FSR4. I'm really excited. I think you're really excited about it. And what I wanted to do here today was pretty much look to build a dream price performance gaming PC. So everything that we have on our desk is actually geared towards priced to performance to saving you money. And in this video, proudly sponsored by ASUS and AMD, we're going to show you how to make it happen. And of course, at the end of the video, we're going to show you exactly how this thing performs as well, so you can see exactly just how good the RX970 XT is, and ultimately whether you want to do what I'm doing right now and pick one up. So yes, today we are very much going for the dream price performance team red build. It all starts with this. This is the Prime Asus RX970 XT and this is actually meant to be an MSRP skew. Hopefully you can get it for that. Hi guys, editor Kyle quickly jumping in. So this was filmed before the recent pricing changes. When Marcus agreed to make this video, this was the price we were told in an email from ASUS. 4 days later, we got another email with this attachment showing the price at just under £636 in the UK. So whenever Marcus mentions MSRP or pricing, just remember that this was filmed before that change. Marcus is actually currently down under having a whale of a time in Australia. Otherwise, he would have amended this himself. Here he is by a bridge. Here's an opera house. And here's some strange looking dogs. Anyway, enjoy the video. Just be aware this was filmed before the pricing changes and before Marcus left the country. Bye. Let's open up our box, shall we? And actually see what we have on offer. And this being a Prime card, it's all about price to performance, obviously, like the rest of this rig. It's really quite attractive, actually, but it's not as large as some other cards, which personally I quite like. Obviously, you can get even better thermals and acoustics if you go for like a higher skew, but it's not really what I'd recommend personally speaking. It depends obviously on the exact card and what it is that you're after and what the air flow of your case and things are like, but personally speaking, I typically would go for a more MSRP skew myself. This one is an OC edition. It does actually have three eight pins on the top. So, obviously make sure you have a decent power supply to pair with this, but you do also have this little cutout. It's got like a pass through design as well, which obviously helps with thermals and acoustics. And then you do have a couple of different modes. So you've got your performance and your quiet. And this also doubles as a dual BIOS switch essentially. So if you ever had any issues, as unluckily as it is, then you could swap to the other one and it would mean you wouldn't have to send the card back, which is quite nice. And then you do have display port 2.1 typea and HDMI 2.1 on the side of this as well. Let's pop this to one side for a second though and actually press on to the rest of our build cuz obviously a gaming PC is not going to build itself. That's why I'm here. And we have a brand new motherboard as well from Asus Tough. This is the B850 plus Wi-Fi. Again, all about price to performance. Doesn't have the same bandwidth as like X870E, but again, for a gaming PC, you don't really need it to be honest with you. So, this is more than sufficient. And I must say that I really do like what ASUS have been doing with their tough boards recently because I hate to say it, but cheaper motherboards tend to often look cheaper, whereas Tough pretty much always seems to nail priced performance and they still have a board that you kind of really proud to have and show off in your system. Especially obviously if you're going for the black theme. I mean if you're going for like a all-white system maybe this isn't the right pick. This particular board actually comes with Wi-Fi 7 support though which is nice. Loads of USB and it does also support USB bar flashback. So if you're buying this with a unreleased but compatible AM5 CPU then you can actually update this motherboard without needing an old chip in order to do it which is always a nice touch. But let's now get our PC building party on the road, shall we? And actually start building our system. Now in case you're a newbie quick cheat sheet. Make sure you do it on top of your motherboard box. It makes a lot easier. You've got light. You can see what you're doing. You can reach around. Very useful. This is where your CPU is going to go. You have your RAM slots here. Now, ASUS have made this very simple and straightforward for you by actually labeling them with this gray color cuz you want to use slots two and four. If you use the others, you're not either going to get the full bandwidth or it's not going to be optimized if you just put it in one and three. It will still work almost certainly very similarly, but again, not optimized. So, use these two gray ones. This is where your SSD storage is going to go in these little heat sinks here. In order to power your system, you need to use this 24 pin ATX here and then at least one of these eight pins at the top lefthand corner. If you do have the capability, plug both of them in. It looks neater and you're getting the best power delivery essentially, but it's not actually necessary depending on the CPU to plug both of these in if you don't have all of the connections. We do have our fan headers here. These actually obviously control the fans that you have on your case and any CPU coolers that you might have. If you don't plug your CPU cooler fan header in, then you'll get a warning. your PC probably won't boot to protect itself and obviously if you don't plug the fans in then bits will overheat which is bad. Don't do that. These are our addressable RGB headers. Usually plug these in at the same time as the fans cuz obviously the fans have RGB. You got two up here and then another one down here at the bottom. This connection here is for your front panel. It's usually pretty straightforward in most cases now as it comes as a single block. On some of them it can be like tiny little connections so you got to make sure you plug them the right way. This essentially makes your power button actually do anything. If you don't plug this in, then your system won't boot, and it's a common cause of PCs not starting. We also have our USB. This is for the USBC. This is for USB 3. And then down the bottom, any USB 2 devices or older cases will use these. Obviously, the speed varies depending on the device that you're plugging in. If you're using any older SSDs, you probably want to use the SATA port on the right hand side. And it's interesting to see these dwindle over time. This only has two because that bandwidth is going to other more up-to-date bits of the board. And then we do have our HD audio for the front panel. And then we also have some extra fan headers again if you're plugging in extra fans. At this stage then you should now be a motherboard expert and ready to actually install your chip. And the one we're using here I think is going to be the right choice for most people. This is the Ryzen 7 9700X. And if you want even better bang for buck and you're happy to go for the previous generation and get something in a sale then you could go for the Ryzen 7700. But in certain games I think you will start to see a bit of CPU bottlenecking. So, if you step up to this, you are going to get better performance. Now, obviously, the elephant in the room is the people saying, ""Well, why don't you go for the Ryzen 7 9800 X3D? That's the fastest gaming CPU. Isn't that going to make more sense?"" And the answer is yes, if you're happy to spend more. It is very easy to recommend. But, as I say, the whole point of this system is to try and get you the best bang for buck really possible at the high-end. And if you're going to spend, especially in the US, quite a lot more on that chip. You do get more performance, but you don't necessarily get better bang for the buck. With that installed, we can then press on to our memory or our RAM. And this is a 6,000 MHz kit, 32 GB CL30. This is actually XMPP, but I'd recommend and I will link along with everything else featured. Actually, all of the components current pricing always link down below. I would recommend an Expo kit, but I kind of use this just to demonstrate that XMP is fine as well. So, if you can get it at a lower price, by all means, go for it. But Expo is optimized for AMD, so you're more likely to have better success when it comes to RAM overclocking. So that means you got to turn on the XMPP or the Expo profile in the motherboard BIOS, but I will show you how to do that when we get there. Don't worry. It lines up the perfect shot. It was nowhere near. It was a disaster, unlike the current pricing on this SSD. Terrible segue, but we're going to use it anyway. This is the KC 3000 SSD from Kingston and I've been using this for almost a couple of years I think now. It's not a new drive per se. It's PCI generation 4, but read write speeds on this are very very strong and it does also have a DRAM cache as well. So the performance on this is going to be great but the price isn't really that different to more cheaper drives to be honest. You can buy a terabyte version of this just under £80 here in the UK and the two TB drive is around about £130. So I think that's very good value especially if you have slower internet speed. I think actually that's going to be the determining factor for a lot of people. If you've got fast internet, you can get away with a terabyte if you want to save money. If you've got slow internet and you want to have loads of games in your system, upgrade to two. But you just want to remove this little heat sink and then take away that little film. Drop your SSD into position and then replace the heat sink and screw back down. With that out of the way, we are pretty much I was so worried that was going to fall off the desk then. That's not sensible. Don't slide it, Marcus. How many times? Now that that's out the way, I do want to talk about the cooler because it's not necessary to do this now, but I always want to check the mounting before we put our motherboard inside our case just cuz it makes everything easier essentially. And this is a slightly smaller version of the LC 360 ARGB Prime that we tested last year that I really liked actually mainly just because it's pre-installed. You know me, usually I hate radiators, whereas this was radiators are okay and it's weird seeing a 240. We don't use them that much anymore. Whereas back in the day, these used to be all of the rage. A 360 was madness. This is madness. But look, preassembled for you. You don't have to muck about with the fans as long obviously as the orientation of this is correct. So, it's blowing through into the all-in-one, which is nice. But it does look like there is a slight modification to make to our board. So, we just want to take these four silver screws out. Don't worry, this is very normal and by design. This is called the default AM5 mounting hardware. Then you want to pick up your AM5 screws from the cooler box and then just put these in those holes. And then once you've done all four, you are now ready to actually Don't slide it. Don't slide it. We are now ready to actually start building our system for real. This is a ProArt case. Actually, that's why this is called the PA41. Left the box there so I could see the name cuz I knew I would forget that. It's not the most catchy name in the world, but I mean, does it matter? And I got to say actually that this is something that's quite refreshing because look at the size of it. This is a higherend price to performance chassis but one that's not massive. I mean it's the footprint really. It's the depth. You can see this is going to look just as good like on someone's desk built up with a full gaming PC as it is as a workstation like under your desk or something. So I like what they've done. But let's open this up with those little tabs actually to get that. That's a really nice mechanism and have a look what we have inside. So we've got a couple of very large fans actually on the front. They look like 160s to me. Obviously, you'll put your motherboard here. There's not actually a load of mesh or something down the bottom. You'll find that on a lot of cases these days, but I don't actually think it makes that much difference to be honest and it is going to hide your cables. I like the fact that you do have this hole here as well, so your graphics card cable can go up through that. So many cases don't do it. Really frustrates me. But let's give this a spin round. We'll show you that there is some cable management here. And sponsored video or not, ASUS, I am going to moan. I don't really understand. You've got this cool little lock here so you can't take the side panel off by accident essentially. But then that doesn't apply to this one. I mean, they've done a good job on the actual side panel though cuz like that's nice and strong. Doesn't really warp or anything when you move it, which is always good to see. And then in terms of cable management and things, I mean, it's a little bit basic, but it's got everything that you need. Your main cable management channels are here. Room for SSDs and things. I think this is going to work quite nicely. Only extra things I'd like to see maybe be some extra hooks here. Kind of like the ones you've got on the back, but on the inside, I think that'd be useful. I assume the front panel, yeah, literally just pulls away as well. And you do have a dust filter in there. Quick shout out, by the way, to say that if you do want to go for this in a wood finish, you can actually get one where the front panel is wood, which is nice. But let's drop this down on top of our desk. We'll get our little accessories box that actually comes at the top of the box. We can then grab our board, line this up, look, with the hole at the back. You want to kind of get this standoff to cling onto your board. Look. Then just use the screws included with your case to get this secure. And then we can install our cooler by taking off this little top piece with the tab. I was going to say it doesn't look like your radiator bracket removes, but actually look, they've been very clever. And just like that, here we have our rad bracket. Then get your bracket and drop that on top. So just take the opportunity to get that screwed and fitted down. And then if you've done everything correctly, this should feed through at the top. cable should be facing the back and it should literally just drop down into place and then screw back down. Grabbing hold of our cooler just to make sure it doesn't damage anything. Let's flip this back on its side. Swap the default bracket for the AMD one literally just by sliding that on. Carefully removing this little plastic tab and exposing the thermal compound. And then literally just line up the screws with the holes and then use these spring nuts on top of the posts and then use a screwdriver in a cross pattern to get that fitted down. Let's not forget though that of course we do need to plug our cables in. So we've got our fan, our pump, and our RGB. So let's start with the pump. There's this little port here called AIO pump. Just slide that over the top. Next to that, we have our CPU fan that we are of course going to use for these fans here. Then we also have our ARGB. And peeling off of that, we have this little extension that we can daisy chain with the pump. But let's now give this a spin round to the other side, shall we? And start to plug some of the cables in. But we do actually have this little fan hub here at the top. Please make sure you don't plug your cooler into this. I suppose you could get away with plugging in your cooler fans, but I highly would not recommend that you want your motherboard to have full control over everything. Case fans, yes. Cooling, no. Essentially, and then remember when we showed you the motherboard earlier? Well, now we've got our USB 3, USBC, and then our HD audio and our front panel. Look, and also the fan header for this hub. Once again, USB 3 is here next to the USBC. Front panel at the bottom right, our chassis fans. And then last but not least, our HD audio. And now that those are complete, ladies and gentlemen, it is time for the most exciting bit, the graphics card. So, first things first, let's take out these little slot covers on two and three. And then we can once again return to the champ, the 9070 XT. And I must admit, this case suddenly looks a little bit on the smaller side. I hope this is actually going to fit. Surely Asus wouldn't send me stuff that doesn't. Oh, it's tight. Look at that. I mean, does it actually fit? Yes. Yes, it does. But I mean, look at the clearance of that. It was like this was planned out, not by me. I can see why they didn't send me something higher up now, cuz that really wouldn't fit in. I mean, for example, if you have the last gen 7900 XTX tough edition, you can see the problem. So, actually, as we alluded to when we were talking about the graphics card in the intro, having something that is a little bit smaller definitely does have an advantage if you do want to use a smaller chassis, but that's probably quite obvious, isn't it? Use the same screws that you've just removed to get this fitted down. We'll pop the top back on as we are done up there. To get your power supply installed, it's actually pretty straightforward with this one. Just remove this little back plate. Then you can pick up your power supply. Make sure the fan is facing downwards on this case and then just put that on top. Then you just want to feed all of these cables through and pull your power supply into place and then fix it down. And then I'm sure this is the bit that probably feels quite intimidating now when you have a load of cables and things dangling down, but they are actually all labeled and there's not really many places you can put them that aren't the right place. So just go slowly, follow the instructions, you'll be fine. So you've got two for your CPU. These will need to go up here. This absolutely ginormous 24 pin ATX just tucks around the side like this. Our SATA connection. Look, we can actually connect now, which is for the fan hub. It's this little port here. So let's use some of that cable management. And get that connected. And then of course, last but certainly not least, we have our PCIe connections. We are going to have to daisy chain one of them, but doesn't really matter. Don't tell anyone. Not at this level anyway. Just feed those underneath and then pull them through the other side. And then it is literally just a case of plugging them in, not forgetting to plug in your CPU. And last but not least, our ATX. And just like that, ladies and gentlemen, your gaming PC should be ready to go. Obviously, you will need to do a little bit of cable management around the back. As I say, just kind of like cleat those there, but the straps have taken everything out, actually. And for a smaller size chassis, we've filled it. It looks good. It's dense, but it's not too much. Should we see if it works? I know that this is absolutely going to be a case of famous last words, but I'm not feeling too nervous. We've got it plugged in and we've got some RGB on the motherboard. But here's your moment of truth. We got some spinning, everyone. That's always a positive thing. Oh, I've not plugged the monitor in. Classic. Let's try again. Cuz if it doesn't boot or you've not plugged in the monitor and then you plug in your display port while it's doing the initial boot sequence, quite often you won't get a signal at all. So, troubleshooting 101 there. Turn it off, turn it on again. That can clear some issues. Oh. Oh. Oh, it's doing something I did suspect. So, when you first use an AM5 motherboard, it does something that's called RAM training. And if you don't have I don't want to say a compatible kit, but sometimes it takes quite a while for your first boot. It will not do this every time. Oh, that's that's amazing. I was getting worried then. I was getting worried, but we've done it. Restart your system and you should get this screen. It says we have our Ryzen 7 9700X and it has detected all of our RAM. Press F1 to go into the BIOS and it's a very simple change in order to get our RAM running at the full rated speed is this setting here called DOCP. If you had an Expo kit, I think this would say expo rather than that. Turn that on. And then here it says DDR5 6000. And then I also like to go and tune our fans or set up a custom curve. And if you haven't already got a copy of Windows on your SSD like I have, which chances are you won't, just go to the Microsoft website, like just type Windows 11, and then you can actually download the installer onto an existing PC. It goes onto a USB flash drive. You whack this in the back of your system, and then your PC will automatically restart, and you just follow the on-creen instructions in order to get Windows installed, and then you'll be ready to go. So, just give me a couple of hours to get all of the games that we need to test on here, get them updated, and we'll be right back. So, then, ladies and gentlemen, here we go. And I'm pleased to say this is actually the first time that I have gamed on a 9070 XT because when Carl did the benchmarking, Carl did the benchmarking. We are also using one of ASUS's brand new monitors here. This is the PG27 UCDM. So this is a QD OLED monitor, 240 Hz at 4K. But let's waste absolutely no more time and let's jump into the bit that really matters, which is the gaming performance. So, what you're seeing here is probably the best example actually of a massive, massive change with the new FSR4 technology. So, this is enabled in the driver at the moment, but there will be games, there are some games like Call of Duty actually, if you can play War Zone, for example, uh the latest one, you can actually turn on FSR4 in the game, but otherwise, you go into the driver and as long as it is FSR 3.1 supported, you can do an override and then you can get FSR4 to just naturally work in your title. So, what you're seeing here is absolute max settings or at least the very high preset and we're running this at 4K, but FSR is currently set to quality. So, personally speaking, I would actually probably turn this down, especially on a 27 in 4K monitor. Like, it's ridiculous. It It may as well be native. You cannot really notice any artifacts, anything wrong with the image. If you look very carefully, you can see that there is a little bit around the character's head, but I mean, it is very, very minute, which when you compare it to the older generations of FSR, which definitely have their uses, but it's a night and day difference. This is a massive step forward, and I'm really, really pleased that AMD have done this, but we're looking at roughly 100 FPS or so. Obviously, it is going to vary depending on when and where you are in the title. I'm amazed as well that this isn't a ray trace title because it looks so so good, but this doesn't actually use ray tracing. So, it does go to show that if the developers don't want to, you can get really good efficiency and still amazing visuals without it, which is pretty darn tasty. But let's see what happens if we go into our options menu. Look, there's our very high preset. We could turn these up to 16x, but very high. Let's be honest, it's absolutely fine. But I want to go and find AMD FSR3. And let's turn this down to performance. So obviously this is now going to render at a lower resolution but then it's going to upscale that to the full 4K resolution that we have on our screen. And as you can see your frame rate will increase quite dramatically actually. But this is a title that is very very dependent on the CPU as well. So we are actually running into a little bit of a CPU bottleneck here. And the reason I want to bring this up is because when we spoke about this earlier and I said kind of like price to performance value. If you wanted to get a higher frame rate then obviously you could go for that 9800 X3D. But my point is, if it's going to happen in games like this when you're looking at around about 110 FPS or so, is that extra money worth it? That's not a question for me to answer. That's for you to answer. But clearly, if you do want to play Horizon Forbidden West and you want to get skyhigh frame rates, this is going to be an awesome way to do it. And even with FSR4 set to performance, you can still see you're getting a really lovely and very detailed image. I mean, let's have a quick look at this cut scene. Can you notice artifacting and muare and things? Like if you look very carefully around edges, you might start to see it, but I can almost guarantee it's mainly going to be YouTube compression unless we kind of zoom in. It's much much improved. And as you can see, I'm a very happy boy. But of course, I don't think it would be right to talk about ray tracing without talking about the title that made it a household gaming name or a gaming household name. That being some Cyberpunk 2077. And what you're seeing now is 1440p ultra ray tracing disabled, but FSR is currently set to quality. So, this is running really well. And if you weren't fussed about that extra visual goodness from RT, then yes, you're going to be getting around about 7580 FPS at 1440p. But there's been massive changes with this generation of AMD graphics cards to make them much better at ray tracing. So, to illustrate this, we can go into our graphics options. We can find this rate trace setting and then we will turn it all on to ultra and then we will come back into our game and moment of truth. What has that done to the frame rate? Not actually that much. We're still looking at around about 80 85 fps or so. And once again, I think a lot of this is down to the fact that Cyberpunk has got pretty heavily dependent actually on the CPU. So whilst our frame rate will have gone down slightly, the reason it's not as dramatic as it was before is because we're likely running into a little bit of a CPU bottleneck. It's always a little bit misleading because if you have a look at our CPU usage at the top left hand corner of your screen, you can see that that's only around about 65 70%. And I always get comments from people saying, ""Well, if it's not 100%, it's not CPU bound. It's not bottlenecked."" But of course, that's not the way that it works because that would assume that a CPU bottleneck needs to use everything available from all cores. But as we know, that's not actually the case. A lot of it comes down to single core performance. But I thought it was a pretty cool demo actually that at 1440p, we can still get around about 75 fps with our ray tracing. And it definitely is quite an obvious difference because they have all of these I was going to say wet puddles, but I suppose all puddles are wet. All of these puddles all around the map where you get all of these lovely reflections if you turn the RT on. So, it's pretty impressive stuff. Now, I do want to see what happens if we turn this up to 4K. I'll be honest, I'm not expecting it to be as good, but we will turn the FSR down a little bit as well to performance and then we will make sure we're running at 4K and then when we come back into the game, is this going to completely break it? No, we have definitely gone down in terms of FPS. Our GPU utilization is around about 98%. But as you can see, we're now getting around about 70 to 80 FPS at 4K on an AMD graphics card. Tell me that is not very impressive. So, if you're playing this on like a I was going to say 4K screen, but anything really like a TV where you're using a controller, especially if it's capped at 60 fps, this is pretty much going to be a perfect experience. How about that? We've come a long way. But ladies and gentlemen, I wasn't satisfied testing just the one RT title. Instead, I wanted to move on and show you something else. So, this is actually a really good example cuz this also has FSR4 technology. So once again, the image quality is vastly improved versus the FSR 3.1 that it replaces in this title, which is Ratchet and Clank. We actually have this set to 4K as well. So this is 4K with FSR set to performance. But here we're actually using the very high preset, and I have manually changed the ray tracing to be high across the board. And once again, this is a really good example of just how you turn on the RT. And obviously your frame rate is going to drop down. That is just the reality of really intensive settings. But you can clearly see that around about 86 FPS or so, this is still going to give you a fantastic experience. And Carl's always on at me to actually try and play this game from start to finish. And this is going to be a great way to do it, even at 4K with that new FSR4 technology. But ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to actually get serious and do some multiplayer action as we duck, dodge, dip, dive, and I can't even remember the quote from that film. Dodge. And we're now running this with FSR 4. And this is actually baked into the game, which is pretty cool. We're running this at 4K. Once again, we've got this set to ultra, but I have turned the textures up. And as you can see, we're getting around about 100 120 FPS or so. Obviously, depending on when and where you are in the title, but let's gear up and actually see if we can play. And you missed me be really bad whilst trying to change some settings. So, now we are actually in the goo lag. And you can see our frame rate is staying pretty consistent actually around about 120 FPS or so. It's surprising as well because you used to get a even higher frame rate than this in War Zone, but since they updated this to the latest version, it definitely is a lot harder to run now. So, do bear this in mind. So, yeah, around about 125 130 FPS at 4K. It's not the way I would probably play the game. I would at least turn the FSR down to performance personally or obviously if you're going to play this at 1440p. And we're going to have to spectate now because I've blown it. And interestingly enough, the frame rate has increased, but not by a crazy amount. So, I once again think that this may well be down to some CPU bottlenecking cuz we're looking at about 140 FPS now. Whereas what you'd typically expect would well, especially when you turn it down to 1440p would be quite a big dramatic difference. But clearly War Zone is just very very CPU dependent. So, this would be the sort of example when yes, 9800 X3D probably would be worth the extra money, but it's not a small amount, right? you're looking at pretty much at least an extra £100 of dollars, if not a fair bit more just to get that chip. So, you've got to ask yourself whether that extra potentially what could be 10, 20, maybe even 30 FPS difference is actually going to be worth it. It's going to depend on the game and the settings and things you're playing obviously. But, yeah, around about 140 150 FPS still going to be a great way to play this game, especially if you are playing at 1440p. But, I do want to talk about thermals and acoustics. At the moment, our GPU is looking about 57 to 63° or so. And you can see that we're leaving about 15% of the performance on the table by that utilization figure at the top lefthand corner of your screen. And then when it comes to the CPU, we're looking about 62 degrees. But I think the thing that's most impressive about this is the fact that this system is pretty much silent. So this is a silent room. And I'm now going to not change any mic settings. Ridiculous. You can barely hear it in a silent room. And this is uh well supposedly MSRP skew. Very very impressive from the kind of do it all system. But that ladies and gentlemen I think is pretty much everything you need to know about this system. It's not the most out there in terms of aesthetics but I really like the fact that it's actually a fair bit smaller. Thermals and acoustics was actually very good on this as well. And obviously you can upgrade like those fans to RGB if you want to have something that's a little bit bolder and brighter. You could swap out the case. But I think all things considered when it comes to aesthetics, performance, value, I think we've done an awesome job here today. But I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. What do you make of the system as a whole? What do you make of the graphics cards? That is editor Carl collecting some GPUs. But we'd love to hear your thoughts on this.

I'll say it a million more times Samsung makes a lot of phones probably too many at this point for their own good and look I'm not a Samsung executive or a high- paid consultant I'm just some dude who yaps in YouTube videos but I feel like I have enough experience at this point between all the phones I've reviewed and all the comments I read from you guys to offer Samsung some suggestions the reason I feel so compelled to help Samsung is because I like them I like their phones I like the fact that they have variety they literally have a smartphone at every price point from like a 100 bucks to 2,000 bucks that's awesome but some of their phones now like this one especially the s24 Fe just really a tough sell and I have a hard time recommending it let me first say that there's arguably nothing wrong with the s24 Fe this year as a smartphone with no other comparisons to be made this has everything you could want a Big Bright High refresh rate screen Flagship specs powering the most up-to-date Android and oneui software experience packed with AI the camera is far better than most people even need let's be honest and the price is well it's fine again if you have nothing else to compare it to but that's the thing the s24 F isn't the only Samsung phone available it isn't technically the only s Ser phone there's three others you could choose from it isn't the cheapest phone Samsung sells either not by a long shot and it's positioned within the lineup a phone that's better than an a series but lesser than a full-on S Series means that spec for spec it still makes more sense to just get the previous year's S Series Flagship at a discount rather than getting this year's Fe at full price and what's sort of interesting is that Samsung agrees with that Viewpoint too they streamlined their us lineup this year by not launching the a55 in the states and when asked why they said basically that they want people buying this Fe or last year's phones instead they sell last year's phones at a discount on their website after all what actually ended up happening though is that people didn't step up to the Fe or even buy last year's phones they just went down one more Rong on the ladder and bought the A35 or the a15 or they just kept their current phones for one more year since really smartphones haven't evolved much in the last three or four years and that's something I'll talk about too all rants aside this is a review of the s24 Fe first and foremost and I'm going to get back to talking about this phone primarily but the reason for my rant is that this phone doesn't exist in a vacuum it's not the only Samsung phone it's not the only mid-tier Android phone so no matter how decent it is on its own it has to be compared to the other options out there and Samsung has to make some changes to make it a bit more appealing but before we get into that with winter here in full force you're probably dreading dealing with increased heating costs and keeping every room in your house slightly above freezing to help with that I would recommend installing a doo wall mounted heater this video is sponsor this little guy is powerful enough to keep almost any room nice and warm it's super easy to install and it's super smart too it's powered by a regular wall outlet and can easily be mounted using the included screws and guide for a quick installation once powered on it can start heating instantly within 2 seconds flowing a steady stream of warm air that you can direct by adjusting the vent 30° up or down the built-in display and buttons allow you to set the heating mode fan speed and more but the doo app is really the best way to control it you'll see the room temperature and you can switch between five different modes eco fan only and three heating levels with Eco Mode the heater can help yield you a 40% Energy savings with precise temperature measurements and open window detection where it Powers off to conserve energy best of all it's an incredibly safe heater with eight levels of protection it won't overheat it's fireproof and waterproof wiring is insulated and it even has a child lock is the top fan and heater brand in the US and their new wallmounted space heater is the portable affordable smart and safe space heater that can keep you warm this winter click the link in the video description below to learn more and use my discount code to buy one if you're interested so from a design standpoint one thing I often say is that with an A series or an Fe like this one no one is going to know that you opted for the cheaper Samsung phone the non-f flagship one all of Samsung phones from the $100 one to the flagship ones look the same name at least from the back and this Fe in particular doesn't get any cheaper of a build either it's gorilla glass victus plus on the front and back it's got an all aluminum frame feels like a premium $1,000 smartphone from the front however well the big 6.7 in screen actually is more of a perk than you might think I know a lot of phones are this big or bigger nowadays but specifically looking at Samsung phones the a series get the big screen size but the S Series well the regular s24 is smaller than this by a lot the s24 plus is more comparable size-wise and I know there's way more with the s24 plus than just its size but if that's the only thing you cared about you save a lot of dollars getting this big phone instead the downside is that if you're particular about bezels those black borders that frame the screen this phone has a pretty thick border and lower screen to body ratio surprisingly people seem to care a lot less about that than I thought so maybe it's not a big deal at all one thing that does irk a little bit about the s24 Fe is that you only get 120 GB of storage on this phone at least for the cheaper $650 price point it's really not a lot by today's standards and with no micro SD card and 30 or so gigs taken up by apps and the OS you're kind of at the mercy of a cloud storage solution to some extent opting for the 256 GB model of this phone at a smidge over $700 I think that doesn't make a ton of sense to be honest so my first outright suggestion to Samsung is this just double the storage on the Fe next year you can afford it when it comes to the display and the overall viewing experience aside from the thick bezels I really don't have anything else to complain about the Fe has a dynamic AMOLED 2x panel it's a full HD 2340 x 1080 resolution it's a 120 HZ High refresh rate display it's bright enough at 1900 nits there's really nothing here that says cheap or budget or lesser when compared to even the flagship S series at least nothing the average consumer is going to notice or miss the problem is that I just don't know where Samsung goes from here the a series phones this year both the A35 and a55 well they have just as good of a screen as this guy the regular Flagship s24 isn't that much better and it isn't until you spend close to $1,000 or more on the s24 Plus or the ultra that you actually get a better screen a higher resolution one a brighter one perhaps better or newer OLED display technology but again the number of people who notice or appreciate that is probably pretty small so what does Samsung do they're kind of stalled out here with the Fe because if they make the screen on this phone any better it's going to overlap with the S Series and the a Series has basically caught up now like I said I don't have any specific suggestions to make the screen better I mean could it be brighter I guess does adding a QHD resolution option make sense maybe does going to 144 4 Herz matter I don't think so I mean look this is a great screen don't get me wrong I wish there were some things I could suggest but this is where I just don't envy Samsung at all it's a tough position to be in and I think rather than trying to change the Fe they should just make this an easier buy with fewer competitive smartphones in their own lineup so when Samsung decided to use their own exos chip inside the Fe this year I think there were a lot of knee-jerk reactions from people who have sworn off X forever saying that this was a mistake and look if you've had a bad experience with previous AOS chips I don't blame you for wanting to avoid them still I also fully agree that using an exos chip regardless of the fact that this is a new higher tier chip kind of lessens the value of the Fe in some way I mean the s20 Fe the original phone in this series its big selling point was the fact that it had the same Flagship Snapdragon processor as the actual flagship s20 so yeah this s24 Fe probably should have gotten the Snapdragon 8 series just to keep things consistent and make everyone happy but there's three counterpoints I'll try and make in support of Samsung here first and foremost this chip really isn't bad at all in fact in my experience I haven't had any issues with performance or overheating even running some of the games that I play at settings that probably aren't necessary but hey the phone and the processor can do it the developer offers it so you may as well try and take advant anage of it I really don't think the exos 2400e in this phone has any of the issues that previous exos chips have had and it seems like a lot of other people are seeing that too this is a processor that is Flagship caliber and it's hard to convince me otherwise and probably harder still to convince almost anyone else these days the second thing I'll say is that Samsung is probably battling some higher costs with the top-end Snapdragon chips right now and so in order to keep this phone cheap or cheaper they probably can't put the higher tier most expensive smartphone processor in a phone that isn't their Flagship device I obviously don't know the cost to make a smartphone nowadays but I'm giving Samsung the benefit of the doubt here if using their own exos chip keeps this phone a few hundred cheaper then fine so be it and last but not least whether the exos chip is good bad or completely irrelevant Samsung is still putting money behind developing it it's in their road map that's probably two or three or four years out at any given time so while we all might complain about the exos chip now Samsung might have already had this one in development a few years ago and it was too late to do any drastic product changes or attempt to revitalize the exos name in the future I guess we'll see if exos will remain an in-house chip that Samsung uses on their own devices I mean I can see it with their low-end and mid-tier phones but I think a lot of everyday consumers are maybe starting to prefer the name brand stuff they're more familiar with tech companies they're more familiar with the names like Snapdragon they know what devices might have those chips inside and I just don't think Samsung is like a Pioneer in chip technology right now at least not mobile processors versus Snapdragon but I guess we'll see what happens looking ahead and considering some rumors I've seen for the next gen Snapdragon chips being even more expensive I actually don't think the next Fe if there is one will get the latest Snapdragon either but I guess we'll see what happens perhaps there's a Snapdragon processor that's like 90% as good that still affordable that Samsung might use instead one sort of odd thing about the s24 Fe is that inside this phone has a 4700 milliamp battery which on its own has actually been totally fine for my purposes it's easily an all day phone I've maxed out at around 11 hours of screen on time but I'm usually pulling eight or nine hours with ease it's just that this is such a big phone and so many other Samsung devices have 5,000 milliamp batteries and they've all had 5,000 m Batteries Now for so long with no outright increase in capacity I feel like even a 5,500 or 6,000 mAh battery would make this phone really stand out and I don't know why Samsung and many of the other major smartphone companies are so afraid of going bigger also the 25 W wired charging and 15 W Wireless that's fine I guess but similar to the battery size Samsung seems to no longer be a leader in charging speeds I realize half the population still uses a 5 wat us usba charger with half the stuff they own but still if there's something that can easily be improved with not just the Fe but with all Samsung phones right now it's bigger batteries and faster charging speeds last but not least I want to just briefly touch on the camera with the s24 Fe I've done a few comparisons already with this phone the a series and the S Series and I know Samsung is going to continue to reserve all its high-end Flagship features and lenses for the top Flagship phones especially the ultra and while this phone is better than the a series for sure even though honestly the a Ser cameras this year are pretty darn good I don't think Samsung is like ever going to say that the Fe has the same camera setup as the flagship they have to reserve that stuff for their Flagship phones now and for forever probably since that's really what Samsung and Apple and plenty of other companies are focusing all their attention on anyway at least during the last few years of smartphones all that camera stuff and more than anything else I think if you're like all in on photography or film making or utilizing every single camera feature on your smartphone for whatever it is that you do you're going to be opting for an ultra or an iPhone Pro or a pixel Pro something that's entirely 100% camera focused for this Fe the camera is great it's nearly Flagship caliber and it has stuff like 8K video recording that 99.9% of Fe owners will literally never use mostly people are just going to appreciate that this phone takes a good picture a better picture for sure than any budget or mid tier phone they would otherwise purchase or might be familiar with and this certainly separates the Fe from the cheaper a series phones if you needed any other reason to go this route so where does Samsung go from here well here's my suggestion Samsung should have like four or five phones in their lineup and that's it a cheap option like the a15 an actual mid-tier option like the A35 and then the Fe and the regular s Flagship should probably merge so you end up with like an entrylevel S Series phone and then an ultra S Series phone there doesn't need to be an Fe and a small regular Flagship and a plus and an ultra and three or four a series phones on top of all that it's just too many and given the choice people I think are either just going for the cheaper option whatever it is or they already are set on the most expensive option this muffled Middle Ground of phones that Samsung is stuck with right now is doing them no favors and the Fe feels like it's suffering because of it even though it's a perfectly good phone on its own but what do you guys think Samsung should do would you buy an Fe under any circumstances right now let me know in the comments down below I'd love to hear your thoughts of course hopefully you guys

of this product people have been waiting a very long time for them and there's a whole bunch of new features it's got better audio it's got wireless charging active noise cancellation it's got a a heart rate sensor built right into the buds themselves it's lighter it's more comfortable everything's new however despite all those amazing features I find this thing surprisingly underwhelming okay let's get into it the main differentiating feature about the Power Beats Pro lineup is that these have ear hooks these are not common anymore I think the world has moved to just like different shaped tips but these have the hook which allows it to have a very secure fit when you're wearing it for kind of rigorous physical activity if you're working out or running or mountain biking or just doing like inverted aerial maneuvers this hook will keep this Bud securely in place and also these have physical control so you have volume controls as well as a button to activate the different modes and these volume control buttons and action buttons are present on both the left and right uh buds now the hooks themselves uh like they're not meant to be like bent and wrapped around they just go right over your ear and they just stay in this kind of shape and form but they're very comfortable to wear now the rubber tips that make the inner seal are definitely a harder rubber on the Power Beats Pro 2 than on the the airpods pro to so this is Apple's like kind of regular Flagship product and this is just a much more softer rubber but there's still I would say equal in Comfort it's just I think the harder rubber is there to prevent just wear I think this is like more Fitness oriented product and there's like a lot more sweat and ickiness so stronger rubber now inside the package when you get this you do get five different uh sizes so you get the one that's on there ready plus four other tips it's just to give a more precise fit for the user in terms of sound quality I think the Apple airpods Pro 2 at least for me is like the gold standard of Wireless earbud audio quality the Power Beats Pro 2 they don't sound as good but they kind of sound as you'd expect it's a beats product the audio is just a little more playful stronger bass and more emphasized trouble and when I measure them it's not like a flat Studio profile it's obviously shaped more like a V but it's done with intent having just fatter bass and more pronounced troubles is something that people actually seek I actually like the sound it's just that's what they're going for it's very on brand for Beats this is being recorded from the mic of the Power Beats Pro 2 I think they sound okay nothing special and this is the mic quality on Apple's airpod Pro two I think they sound very similar I don't think I'd be able to choose a winner there's also Apple's H2 chip in here so that handles the active noise cancellation it also handles transparency mode so you can have it on you can hear your environments if you're running you can hear cars and stuff it also hand cancel spatial audio so for movies and shows but the big thing really is that active noise cancellation cuz that was the feature that the owners of the first one really wanted and it's finally here now A&C on this product is a mixed bag for sounds that are just like environmental I want to call it white noise but like a steady constant background sound so like a treadmill that's going or like an Air Conditional or if you're on a plane this product handles it pretty well so I think Apple's airpods Pro two handles it particularly well if this was a 10 on like the the scale of how well it handles that type of noise cancellation this would be like a I'd say an eight maybe an eight and a half but I'd say eight but when it comes to more random noises so like a clap or a sudden bang so I was at the gym with these things on and you could hear people dropping weights and just machines clanking that type of sound that random sound is handled really poorly on this device and I'm if I'm being honest very disappointed because this has the same H2 chip as what we see in Apple's airpod Pro 2 and this thing had amazing noise cancellation capabilities how does this newer product not do it as good now the thing that kills me is that Apple has all the patents all the technology all the IPS to make this thing the best of the best in terms of ANC right and it's a fitness product those are the users that would want it the most people going to the gym people running on streets you just want to like tune out the world this in my mind should have the bestc but it doesn't unfortunately now the other feature I want to talk about the last big one is the heart rate sensor so uh it's an optical heart rate sensor it's present on both the left and right bud and it's located on the bottom of each bud and these things shine a light that presses right into this part of your ear now it's an optical sensor so it shoots a very bright green light that you actually can see when it's in use the heart rate sensors seem fairly accurate when it compared it with the polar chest trap it was off by like one or two BPM so I'd say that's pretty good but the thing I really dislike about this whole heart rate sensor thing built in here is that it is very difficult to even check your heart rate so I have to launch an app click around in a few things in order to just see that heart rate so right now I I ran a fitness app and obviously I'm not working out but uh and just the number right there 77 beats per minute so this is there's just so much friction to be able to do that like I can't just like be listening to music walking down the street and be like hey what's my heart rate pick up my phone and look I have to do the whole app launch and just go around in the app and it's also only supported by a handful of apps right now so this to me feels so unlike an Apple product Apple devices and the whole ecosystem is usually really frictionless but this requires apps and like sign-ins into third party apps to make this I don't know it just feels it feels Superfluous considering how like present smart watches and fitness trackers are for anybody who cares about this kind of stuff and one other thing when you are monitoring your heart rate with these buds it drains battery a lot faster I did a test where I did two hours of heart rate tracking versus two hours of just audio listening and it's a really significant difference you can also connect it to Bluetooth enabled gym equipment like treadmills and ellipticals the new case is lighter and smaller than the previous generation but it's still a fairly chunky case especially if you compare it to like the regular uh airpods Pro cases and it has USBC charging which is nice to see and it also supports wireless charging the Power Beats Pro 2 has a wicked long battery life this thing has 10 hours of battery life per charge and up to 45 hours if you include the power Reserve that's in the case uh and this like this new case and charging system solves what I think was the biggest issue I had with the original Power Beats it's that you can charge this so easily now so you can casually drop it in and it just charges you can even hold this thing upside down and it'll just charge because the magnets are strong and it's just way better than the charging system of the old one that one was so finicky and you just had to like jostle it around to make it work but they fixed that now there's a few negatives to this product so the first thing I talked about was the ANC not being strong enough the second thing I think is that the the heart rate sensor is not nearly as useful as I would have want it to be and I think it's no fault of the product itself I just think is the idea the idea of it it's like how many people are really using something like that in 2025 uh but the biggest thing for me is the price point this thing is 250 us and that's what the original one launched for but this is six years later the market is so much more competitive in the wireless earbud space there are so many good Fitness focused wireless earbuds that are like $100 cheaper than this if not more so you have to ask yourself is that heart rate sensor really worth that price premium that they're demanding and I think for most people it really isn't it's just so many good options now uh but there you have it that's the power beads Pro two,1,"The video titled ""PowerBeats Pro 2 Review - Underwhelming"" is a straightforward product review focusing on the features"
je92OePq5HzAuaePedwTrXHe6IM,Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 Review - 6 Months Later,Did Microsoft make a true MacBook Air competitor with the Surface Laptop 7 CoPilot + PC? How has its battery life been?,6 Months Later,2024-12-21T16:45:02Z,"{'default': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nfnq__xvmMc/default.jpg', 'width': 120, 'height': 90}, 'medium': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nfnq__xvmMc/mqdefault.jpg', 'width': 320, 'height': 180}, 'high': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nfnq__xvmMc/hqdefault.jpg', 'width': 480, 'height': 360}}",,nfnq__xvmMc,643,237101,en,nfnq__xvmMc,"It's been 6 months since I bought 
Microsoft's new Surface laptop, and I keep coming back to the question: Has 
Microsoft finally created a Windows laptop that can truly compete with the MacBook Air? 
After spending half a year with this device, I think I know the answer, 
and it might surprise you. The first major highlight of this laptop is 
its build quality and design. Microsoft has created something that feels very much like 
a MacBook Air that runs Windows, especially with that premium feel you get thanks to 
its aluminum unibody construction, and yes, it weighs about the same as a MacBook Air. The 
trackpad is another standout feature - it's probably the best I've ever used outside of a Mac. 
It has excellent precision, supports multi-finger gestures, great haptics, just like the Mac.
The display is also impressive, featuring a 120Hz refresh rate, which is actually better 
than the MacBook Air's 60 Hz screen, and yes, it's a touchscreen. Now, if you've never 
had a laptop with a touchscreen before, you might be wondering, ""Well, what is the point 
of having a touchscreen in a laptop?"" For some, you might find it more convenient to use your 
laptop like your phone, and Windows is pretty well optimized nowadays for touch capability. But 
given the Surface laptop's conventional design, where the screen only bends so far, I find 
having that functionality a bit limiting. If it were more like the Surface Pro where you could 
detach the screen from the keyboard or flip the screen around where it would act more like a 
tablet, I'd probably use the touchscreen more. The only slight downside to the display I found 
is its anti-reflective coating isn't as good as on other laptops like the MacBook Air. If 
there's a trade-off between these two things, I'd rather not have a touchscreen and have a 
better anti-reflective coating. Battery life is another major highlight - this laptop is 
rated for up to 20 hours of video playback, and in my experience, it easily lasts an entire 
workday and then some. However, apps that are not optimized for the ARM processor might drain the 
battery faster. What's even more impressive is its standby battery - I've had this thing closed 
for like a period of about 2 weeks, and I barely noticed it dip in charge, which is impressive.
Regarding performance, I got the version with the Snapdragon X+ processor, and that's been 
totally fine for my needs. I mainly have used this laptop for work, so writing in Google 
Docs, editing our website via WordPress, checking emails, surfing the web, and other 
similar activities. Now, what about games? Well, because of its ARM architecture, don't expect 
it to be able to run all of the games that you could run on a traditional Windows laptop 
with the same level of performance. I did try some gaming on it - Manor Lords, which uses 
Unreal Engine 5, runs okay on medium settings, like it's playable but only barely. I'd 
probably give it a 3 out of 10 for playability. Now, Cities: Skylines, that's another game I 
play regularly, and it's a CPU-intensive game that's almost 10 years old now, and surprisingly 
did load after a 3-minute wait on this laptop, and it's actually playable, though I did crash 
the game when trying to set textures to medium. So overall, I'd probably give it a 5 out of 
10 for playability. Just keep in mind not every game will run on an ARM-based Windows 
laptop, and of the games that can run on it, not all of them may run well.
The speakers are another impressive feature - they get quite loud, quite a bit 
louder than the MacBook Air's. The MacBook Air seems to top out at around the 75% volume 
mark on the Surface laptop. They sound decent; however, don't expect fantastic well-rounded 
audio with good bass. For that, you'll be much better off connecting a good set of headphones 
like the Sonos Ace, which I recently reviewed, or the Sony WH-1000XM5s, which I've also reviewed.
Another thing I like about this laptop's design is the charger that Microsoft provided - it 
magnetically attaches to the laptop, so if someone trips over the cord while it's charging, 
the laptop will not go flying across the room, just like the MacBook Air's MagSafe charger.
Now, you might be wondering why I keep comparing this laptop to the MacBook Air, and that's 
because that's the laptop that Microsoft really benchmarked this one against and wants 
this one to be able to beat because the MacBook Air is still like the best-selling laptop in 
the world at the time of recording, at least. I've also come to really appreciate 
the customizability of this laptop and its Windows operating system, especially with 
Microsoft PowerToys. You can do things like enable Alt + Spacebar to search across your computer, 
peek into files before opening them, and even remap shortcuts to match the Mac's more ergonomic 
layout for copy and paste if you want. Windows Phone Link is another standout feature - you can 
connect your Android or iPhone to your laptop, though Android users get more features. Android 
phones allow you to mirror your entire screen, receive notifications, text people, pin apps 
from your phone to your desktop, take calls, access photos, and control media playback.
So what features have I found myself not using? The first is Windows Recall, which was 
only recently rolled out after Microsoft had to pull the feature over safety concerns earlier in 
the year. This feature lets the operating system take screenshots of what you do on your laptop 
and then uses AI to analyze those screenshots to help you find things later. It works similarly 
to the Pixel Screenshots app I discussed in my video about the new Pixel 9 this year, except 
with Recall, you don't have to remember to take a screenshot - the OS just automatically 
remembers what's been shown on your screen. Microsoft Copilot is another feature I rarely use, 
even though it has its own key on the keyboard, and Microsoft has made a huge deal about the 
new Surface laptop and other Windows laptops being rebranded as Copilot Plus PCs. I think a 
lot of it is going to feel like AI overhype to the average user. Now, that's not to say I'm an 
AI skeptic or think the technology isn't useful. On the contrary, I've used Claude and ChatGPT to 
help me generate a few thousand lines of code for new functionality on 6MonthsLater.net, something 
I probably would have had to pay a web developer a couple grand to actually build. The main challenge 
with Copilot is to a lot of people, it might not seem very useful, especially for providing 
reliable information since these models are prone to hallucinating and just making things up, and 
as of this recording, Copilot can't do things for you on your PC like adjust settings, for example.
Now let's discuss the downsides I've encountered with this laptop. The first is annoyances with 
Windows. Windows is like incredibly hostile if you want to download Chrome onto this laptop 
- there must have been like five different popups trying to get me to or convince me to use 
Microsoft's browser, which is called Edge now, and honestly, all of that just made me want 
to try Edge even less. The news feed that's enabled by default in the widgets panel just shows 
clickbait headlines so Microsoft can probably run ads against it - it just kind of cheapens the 
feel of Windows and the Surface laptop overall. Another downside I found is with the 
auto-brightness - the adjustments on occasion aren't smooth, and they can be a bit jarring. 
This example is a bit dramatic; sometimes it's a little bit more subtle than this, but it just 
doesn't fade, it just kind of goes to whatever the next brightness setting is, which is weird.
The last downside is the legacy keys that you can find on the keyboard function row. Having Home, 
End, and Page Up and Down keys seems a bit dated, to be honest. I think three of these 
would be better used as Play/Pause, Skip Forward, and Skip Back keys like you have 
on other laptops, including the MacBook Air. So do I recommend the Surface laptop? Overall, 
I've really enjoyed my time with it and can easily recommend it to anyone looking for a 
general-purpose laptop with a sleek design, good build quality, excellent battery life, 
and typing experience that runs Windows. I've actually struggled to find many major flaws with 
this laptop - Microsoft has just done a very good job at building a solid Windows laptop that feels 
great, and now that you can get them for, you know, a couple hundred off their list price now, 
like it's just a very compelling laptop overall. Now, has Microsoft actually created a laptop that 
can compete with the MacBook Air's performance? Depending on what benchmarks you look at and 
what chip you configure with the Surface laptop, yes and no. But did Microsoft create a beautifully 
designed laptop that compares well to the MacBook Air, has excellent battery life, a good display, 
and overall decent software experience? Yes. The only area where you'll really still want to stick 
with a Mac, though, is if you have an iPhone or a bunch of other Apple devices, and you can see 
why and more of my thoughts on how Macs compare to Windows machines in my comparison between Macs 
and Windows, and you can get to that by clicking on the comparison video in the card above.
As for which configuration to get, they come standard with 16 GB of RAM, which has been fine 
for me, but if you want to try gaming on ARM, you probably should bump up the RAM, though remember 
that the ARM processor is going to limit your choices of what games you can run on it. For most 
people, you're probably fine with a version with the Snapdragon X Plus chip, which is a 10-core 
CPU, unless there's a sale that brings the Elite version of the chip closer to it in price.

360}}",,EbHqeHTIh38,829,218876,en,EbHqeHTIh38,today is a good day for Mac owners because we finally got a more affordable version of what was up until recently one of the only 5K resolution monitors available Apple's 1599 Studio display but is this brand new monitor the Asus proart pa27 jcv actually good or is it just a cheap knockoff with several big deal breakers also quick disclaimer this review is not sponsored by Asus in any way uh and they're also not paying me any money either it's entirely my own experience and opinion okay first of all why is a 5K resolution important when using Max well it has everything to do with the way Mac OS scales itself you know when you jump into system settings and then display and select how big or small you want text and UI elements to appear Mac OS can only scale itself up or down by a factor of two so on a 4k monitor for example you can set the scaling to 1080p if you look at the actual resolution of 4K which is 3840 horizontal pixels by 260 vertical pixels you'll notice that if you divide it by two it perfectly equals the resolution of 1080p which is 1920x 1080 so no worries right well the problem is that 1080p scaling is unusable it just makes everything on the screen huge okay well just change the scaling to 4K problem solved right wrong again now everything is super small so what you end up doing is selecting the middle option 144 40p scaling and it's now much better but look what happens when I divide 2160 by 1440 that doesn't equal two anymore it's 1.5 and this is where the issue is Mac OS cannot scale by a factor of 1.5 so what happens is that font and UI elements for example will appear ever so slightly blurry and more pixelated than what they should be 5K does not have this issue because you can divide it evenly by two also even if there wasn't an issue with 4K scaling on Mac OS uh 5K is still 77% more pixels than 4K so you're getting that retina pixel density of 218 pixels per in on a 27in monitor where if you sit the appropriate distance away from the screen you actually can't see any individual pixels any longer kind of like the retina display on your MacBook but did I actually notice the difference between a 4k monitor and a 5k monitor yes I mean the text and UI elements are a little sharper and I certainly noticed slightly less pixelation overall but controversial opinion uh it's not a night and day difference right particularly when you're sitting the appropriate amount of distance away from the screen I mean sometimes I really had to squint and move my head a bit closer to notice do I prefer 5K of course uh but you know if I already had a really good quality 4k monitor I probably wouldn't feel the need to upgrade just for the 5K resolution alone this you know I was really picky about my font displaying perfectly or I was a graphics designer for example who needs pixel density on their projects so now that you know why 5K is such a big deal for Max let's take a look at the rest of the monitor in terms of the design I think it's kind of ugly like it's made of black plastic uh the front bezel is made from a kind of faux metallic material uh it's also got a really big logo and it's quite thick to make room for all the menu and navigation buttons in the right corner to be fair this is quite functional though because those buttons function as shortcuts so you can quickly switch between color profiles or input and change brightness for example but overall uh yeah it's not winning any Design Awards especially if you compare it to the monitor I was previously using with my MacBook the Dell Ultra sharp range but I get it you know Asus has to compromise somewhere to keep the cost of this monitor down after all you're buying it for the 5K resolution I display not as a fashion statement moving on the stand is basic but functional there's height adjustment swivel tilt and portrait mode but like you've seen in the b-roll of this video it's usually better to just use the Visa mount on the back with a monitor arm I'll link the one I'm using in the description below side note the pa27 jcv has a built-in power supply so there's no big Power Breck required just a power cable speaking of power if you want to extend the battery life of your smartphone or MacBook ecof flow's New Rapid magnetic power bank is a great option and big thanks to ecoflow for supporting my work on this channel and sponsoring this section of the video now I'm currently traveling and the rapid allows me to charge my iPhone at 15 wats via mag safe with a built-in kickstand or 30 WS via the built-in USBC cable it's really fast too my iPhone 15 Pro went from 0% to 50% in just 42 minutes using the cable and yes it charges MacBooks and iPads too also if I want to charge multiple devices at once I can with the ch2 certified wireless charging for example two phones at the same time or even my airpods and a phone simultaneously the rapid uses ecoflow patented extreme technology for Flagship smartphone level energy density and fast charging capability to balance the compact size and power charging from 0% to 70% in just 33 minutes you can also pair it with ecof flows WRA 30 W Gan charger for an ultra Compact and portable charging setup so click the link in the description to check out ecof flow's rapid magnetic power bank and 30 W Gan charger today moving on to Ports the pa27 jcv is primarily designed to be used with laptops and it's essentially a two-in-one device a monitor and a desktop dock it comes with the usual display port and HDMI inputs but you'll ideally use the included USBC cable to connect your laptop to the monitor provide up up to 96 WS of charging output an image to the screen and also gives you access to any devices connected to the monitor via the port selection on the back now the port selection is okay uh you can plug a few USB devices into the back I have my USB microphone Mouse dongle and Kanto u4 speakers attached there and there's two front quick access ports for additional connectivity or you know charging devices like an iPhone for example but this monitor does not use Thunderbolt technology unlike some other monitors in this space so all of these ports are only USB 3.2 gen 1 speeed which caps out at 5 gbits per second but overall yeah while it's no comparison to the Apple Studio display uh or the Dell U 2724 de for example with a full-on dock built into it uh it gets the job done and it works well it also has an auto KVM switch built in and I really love seeing this feature in monitors because if you're like me and you have a dual Mac and PC setup for example uh you can just quickly switch between the two computers using the input shortcut on the front bezel soon as you change the display input using this shortcut button everything plugged into the ports on the back like you know a mouse or a keyboard for example automatically connects to whatever computer you're currently using there's no need to fiddle around unplugging devices or switching everything over manually and yes if you're wondering the 5K resolution works fine on Windows computers the menu system is basic but functional there's a joystick on the right for navigation and five shortcut buttons these two can be customized I have mine set to color presets so I can easily switch between them and the other is for adjusting the brightness now speaking of brightness for Mac users here's a tip that is a little bit of a game changer for you and if you like it promise me you'll hit that subscribe button instead of stuffing around with that joystick to change brightness every time there's a free app you can download called monitor control and it lets you directly adjust the brightness of the Pro art monitor from your Mac without having to manually change the monitor it even works with the brightness keyboard shortcuts told you it was a game changer so just hit that subscribe button already so I can give you more tips and tricks in the future so let's talk about the panel this monitor users it's not using any fancy new tech uh it's just the same IPS technology 10bit color and similar contrast ratio that we've seen before and aside from the 5K resolution probably the next biggest sell factor is the color accuracy it's very good with 99% of DC3 100% of srgb and 95% of adobe RGB almost exactly the same as the Apple Studio display unlike the studio display though Asus also Factory calibrates each individual panel to the calman verified standard and you get a piece of paper in the Box showing the results for your individual display side by side with my MacBook Pro and Apple Studio display and Inc matching color modes I honestly couldn't tell the difference apart from the matte display on the pro art now Asus calls this their Lux pixel technology it's a fancy name for an anti-glare low reflection or aglr Surface but it's been done really well in my opinion I mean think of the screen as almost having a very fine paper-like texture which means Reflections and glare are greatly reduced compared to glossy options out there and I didn't notice significantly reduced sharpness or contrast during darker scenes now as someone who typically prefers glossy panels I actually found myself preferring this because I like having natural light in my office and that can cause issues with glossy screens unfortunately unlike the studio display where you can choose between glossy and matte uh there's no glossy panel option for the Asus every monitor just comes with their matte screen as standard backlight bleed is something all IPS panels suffer from but I found it was fairly minimal and I didn't really notice it significantly during any dark scenes really the only negative of the screen is the 60 HZ refresh rate especially when using my 120 HZ MacBook Pro motion screen right next to this monitor uh it is really noticeable and it can be a little bit jarring but a high refresh rate 5K resolution monitor doesn't exist yet and they probably won't for a while right and even if they did they will need a thunderbolt 5 Mac to handle the huge bandwidth requirements so if you really need that 120 HZ or 144 HZ refresh rate uh your only options are a 4K or a 1440p resolution monitor in terms of brightness while the studio display is just in a league of its own the Asus gets more than bright enough for most situations and I've never really come close to increasing the brightness all the way to 100% uh I usually have it around 45% which is plenty for me even during the day so how does this monitor compared to the Apple Studio display I do plan on making a whole separate video going into detail and comparing the two uh but it's fair to say the studio display is better in almost every way build quality visual design uh customization por it's better speakers has a webcam and of course just works seamlessly with Max but you are paying for it I mean $15.99 versus $7.99 is a huge difference and at the end of the day the primary reason why you're buying either of these monitors is the screen right specifically that 5K resolution I mean everything else is secondary and when you compare their screens like I said before there's very little difference but stay tuned for a full comparison video taking a look at other competitors again at the time of this video the Asus Pro art pa27 jcv retails for $799 depending on when you watch this video though it could even be around the $600 to $700 Mark depending on any sales or retailer promotions so I'll leave a link in the description of all the best up-to-date deals I could find now there's also obviously the studio display uh bear in mind that that price only includes the glossy panel and either a Visa only or non height adjustable stand if you want the height adjustable stand and nanotexture display yeah that's going to cost you then there's the Samsung vfinity S9 which is Samsung's version of the studio display with 5K resolution Thunderbolt and built-in webcam reviews are a bit mixed though uh some people love it but others have issues or just overall dislike the monitor then you of course have the typical you know 4K USBC monitors that have been really popular uh like the U 2723 QE from Dell much better Port selection on the back but similar color accuracy and build quality as the Asus but of course it's a 4K resolution panel overall though I thoroughly recommend the pa27 J TV despite the awful name uh I've been really enjoying using it over the last few weeks and in fact I edited this very video on it and it was kind of amazing how identical the colors were to my liquid xdr Retina Display uh on my MacBook that was just off to the side that being said if you have the money I still think the studio display is overall a better monitor but for those of you not wanting to sell a kidney to afford it the Asus has essentially the same 5K resolution and super Super Color accurate panel

Robert Thomas, a power play marker, has the opening goal of the series and the Blues lead one to nothing. Here's the the play and now they're going to gamble at the blue line. Look at those two out by the blue line. And now it's down low and Thomas has got way too much time because Ayafalo and Adam Lowry are out by the blue line. Dylan Dlo's trying to play in between.

The Blues with pressure now. The puck in front. A chance. And they score. It's Oscar Sunquist tying the game up and we are tied at two here in the first period. Late stages. Shen skate right to Sunquist. And you can see Morrisy, he's trying to get off the ice. He can't. Great pressure. And here's Luke Shen tries to kick it up to his stick instead. Kicks it right to Sunquist. The flex and you can see Luke Shen just trying to stop it to get it up to his stick and instead right to Sunquist to down. Nerder taking a hit and messing about feed Samberg who finds Stanley. Stanley behind the net near the net. Perfetti tried to force it home. Perfetti and they did. Here's Pareo into traffic. Thomas taking a whack at it. Couldn't get it on net. Here's Fowler firing and it sticks to hell. No rebound. Power play. Partner, Ryan, and John with the call of the second period. All right, thank you Scott. And second period action has begun and St. Louis Blues entering the zone as Jordan Kyu. Around the boards it goes. Jake Neighbors reverses. Justin Faulk takes it. Kyu looks, shoots, scores. And once again, the Blues have regained the lead. And again, using the power play. Well, two for two already here in this one. Good screen in front. And you see Connor Halick's trying to find it. Lots of bodies in front. Oscar Sunfist does a nice job. Look at Sunquist. And then he just moves his stick. A pass, but for Betty got therely centering pass by Aello. He didn't get what he wanted on it and Bennington covers up Brandon Tan to Appleton. He works it back. Samber a blast. Bennington the save and he vacuums it up in the midseason after blocking a shot. Steven Stamco says peon. He hammers one and that's off the mark. Morrisy moves the puck up the wall.

Making a move in. Conor Helena shuts the door. And there's Kyu right by him. Tries to go fivehole. Bennington stays right with it. Comes across. Gets the pads down tight. Gets the stick down, but it just seems to have been victimized. And now the Jets have to come back. And the Blues are very good protecting a lead after two periods. Perfetti gives it back. Now it's Moresy up top. Shley down low feed. Perfetti. Conor shoots. Bennington. A terrific save. He didn't even see this shot. Just reacts. Pass comes across. He knows he's there. Just go across.

He made a move. Now Shley below the goal line. A center. He scores. [Applause] tie game with 1042 to go in the third thanks to Alexia Fellow. Well, here's the play and I thought Connor was going to give it back to Shipley and he finally does in the corner and look at this pass by Mark Shley. Spins around. It's off the side of the net and you can see Jordan Bennington's reaction. It hits the side of the net. He has his stick there, but it goes off the side of the net right to a foul and he just tucks it into the far side. Shley back to the forehand. Trainer didn't go down and check on him though, so I guess he's all right. Off the drop, Peon over to Moresy. He pushes it to Shifley. Connor scores. [Applause] Kyle Connor the go ahead goal. 136 to go in the third and the Jets have the lead. Here it is right from the face off and it's Mark Shley to win the draw. They haven't won a whole lot of them in this game. They won that one. And look at Connor just slide back. Perfect pass by Shley. Look at this pass by Mark Shley. Just out of the reach of Farco and Connor, no hesitation whatsoever. Boom. Boom. And there's Ayatollo in front of the net. This top line has really set the tone here in the third period. He jams the puck up along the wall. It comes free over to Appleton. He's got Lowry with him in the empty net. Here's a chance. And Lowry scores. gets rewarded. Good battle along the boards. And here it comes. Abdlin gets it. Tyru is the only guy back. He tips that. But there is. And that's going to do it. You can put it in the win column.

Otani swings and misses. Finished him off with the [Applause] curve. Bets off first. Nola to the plate. 10 and a tapper in front of the plate. Rio Muo on the run throws to second for one. Back to first, but not in time. Or unless you're Carlton Fisk and Ed Armister in the 75 World Series. fly into shallow center field. On comes March. He's got it. Is actually the incident you're talking about. Team with a place you want to pitch after the first two starts you've had. But it is what it is. There goes Turner. First pitch. Throw from Barnes. Not in time. And Trey Turner has stolen his second base of the weekend. He's just not even going to swing at it. He gets Harper swinging. So he strikes out Bryce Harper for the first out. Big bouncer towards the middle. That'll bring in the first run. Edmond to Hernandez for out number two. One- nothing Philadelphia. Schwarber scores another one from Aranola. Edmond climbs the ladder, sends it in the air to right field and just got under it a little bit. Castanos on a two- two from Nola. Yanks one down the line. It's a fair ball and extra bases for Muny. He was due and he's got himself a double. Moves the ball around. Hernandez launches a ball towards the left field corner and gone. Kik Hernandez on the first pitch hooks a home run inside the pole. Joe Barnes to short. Trey Turner ends the inning. More of the same though for Aaron who's given up seven runs so far this season. All seven. He not been swinging a much. Shoots this ball to Hernandez for the first out. [Music] Here it is. A fast ball. Scorched to left field by Ry Conforto and he says, ""Oop my bad. Got away with that [Applause] one. Muscled up the middle. Should be two."" There's one and two. 643 double play. They're tied to third. Two out. Conforto lifts one in the air to right center field.

Strikes out Marsh to open this third. Now Schwarber can't lay off. And now he's showing a little something. Backto back Ks to open the third. Not a two-1 from Nola. Pops it straight up. Who wants it? Rio Muto for the first [Applause] out. Off the end of the bat, Marsh. Two [Applause] out. Chopper backs up Bone. Long throw for the long third baseman and he's got him to finish off the Dodgers in the fourth. starts him with the fast ball and it's sent to right field. Hernandez coming on. He's got it and there's the first [Music] out. Got him to chase. He strikes out Castanos. His fourth of the game. Leading off this fifth against Nola and hitting a big bouncer that Nola ranges over to stab. Throws Bonds out. for him. It lets him focus more on his hitting to open the year and the ground here to Bryson. Two up and two down in the fifth, but it is his he loves it. If you go back to, you know, we've talked before about the script that he wrote for his life when he was in high school. That was chopper bone. First one, two, three inning for Aaron Noah. Bed to Marsh a 3-1 offering got in on him and it's sky to right center field. Pahz and Hernandez. Who wants it? Pah has it. Riomo will advance to third. There goes the runner from first. It's hooked into right field for Hernandez. It will tie the game. Oh no. Timing play. Inning over. Stat is doubled off. The run doesn't score. The Dodgers stay in front. 2-1 shot to short backhand pick Trey Turner. Nice play for the first down of the six. Traoro hits a towering fly ball to right field. Castano's going back on the track at the wall. Goodbye. Michael Conorto with a skyscraping home run. A 3-1 lead for the Dodgers. I'm not playing at Dodger Stadium. I'm going to hit one at Citizens Bank Park. Fly to left field and Edmond retired. Two gone in the six. Here comes Nola on the ground to third. Backhand Bone. Another long throw. He's made a couple sparkling plays over there today. To the majors until the end of last season. Bounce to third. Muny trying to do his best. [Applause] Boom. Just in time getting Trey Turner. one away in the six and them spending money. And you know, you've heard everybody talk about, ""Oh boy, the Dodgers are outspending everybody."" And you know what he said? He goes, ""The people that complain are losers."" Strike three to get [Applause] Hernandez. Bouncing ball left side. That's Turner. It's under two. I said Padres's five and three. Yeah, pick a series from the Yankees. Otani sends a mile high fly ball to center field. Marsh waits for it to come down and this game reaches the seventh inning [Applause] stretch. One gone in the seventh as Kasperius strikes out Kepler. Dodgers end up fortunate enough to assistant in Miami. Plus went the manage the Giants for a while. It changed not just Dodger history as Castianos flies out to right field, but Highline drives center field. Pahz makes the catch. Ben Kasparius retires all six that he [Music] faces. And the way those seasons finished sends a fly ball to left field for Max Kepler. Lost in the World Series in 22. Lost in the championship series in 23. lost in the division series last year.

Lightning quick [Applause] eight. Walks one. Two to stop. strikes him out. Man, that thing had a ton of movement to it. Almost like a boomerang for his reactionary at all. He's going to play his guys. Do his best to find Sosa time. Swing and a miss. Vessia gets it by him for out number two. Got him. Three Ks in the inning for Alex Vessia. Serve to center right away. finds Sosa. Paul tends to do that. This streak was this streak, the bad one. 107 average coming into the day. Three ABS turns that whole thing around. Up above 200. There's a little bloop back of third then back below 200. Two out. Saving those legs. Driven in the air to center field. Sosa drifts back and puts it away. passing those seat belts to the bottom of the ninth. This game has been a roller coaster, hasn't it? Kepler serves one to left center field. Conforto on the run.

literally on my MacBook right now tell me about my phone and my camera all dead you're joking you're joking you're joking oh my god this is my princess fairy dream this is my princess fairy dream I

Portugal which I have never been more excited to do if you guys know me you know I've been wanting to go to yoga retreat for like years now anyways I'm really excited to head out into the town today because I just got in today I'm kind of like exhausted a little tired and I just don't want to waste my first day so I think I'm just going to walk around see what I can find maybe ask Chad gbt what should I do like what is my itinerary I don't know but I'm honestly just here to explore to have a good time and can't wait for you guys to see what my Portugal journey I don't know ends up being I might like I don't know ask a follower like someone to hang out like I kind of want to go out maybe I get some wine like I don't even know the world is our oyster so let's go so excited also let me show you the hotel because this place is phenomenal this is going to be my outfit of the day I'm wearing this red gingham top from I don't remember I'll put it up on the screen I'm wearing these

but that was iconic he told me he was give me a discounted tour should I take it I don't [Music] know you watch my Paris videos this is giving the same Vibe where I'm just in a randomly open big square and there's so much space and this feels very beautiful to the eye like oh my God look at this sunset this is giving Sol traveling where you see something really beautiful and you have no one to say hey look at this but you know what that's okay that's okay Hey cuz I'm looking at it and it's gorgeous okay that was a lot that was that was a lot I feel like I need to read a book because I don't know what any of these things actually are for we're going to do that when we sit down right now but it's beautiful the sunset is beautiful and I'm obsessed with the vibes [Music] [Music] okay so I looked online and I found a restaurant that's supposed to be authentic Portuguese food and it's supposed to be really good so we're going to try it out [Music] [Music] I'm getting sight stairs [Music] I'm so embarrassed [Music] okay guys what I'm picking up is that I'm going to have ginormous caps by the end of this because the hills here are so drastic I will say though I'm hearing BOS NOA and if you guys watch my videos religiously you know I use a lot of Portuguese music Brazilian music I love B Nova so maybe I should listen to him live let's go to the [Music] [Music] park guys this room oh my God I want to cry [Music] it's everything I could want and more this is where I deserve to live I think this is my lifestyle I need to be a princess in liso please somebody how do I apply how do I become princess of Lisboa guys I'm sweating I'm sweating I'm hot I'm exhausted I pulled in all nighter last night I didn't tell you guys that but I did and I flew in this morning and I'm sweaty and tired and I wanted to Rally I wanted to party but do you know how hard it is to Rally when you have no friends here it's difficult that's what I'll tell you so anyways um that was a Divine dinner it was awkward as [ __ ] it was really awkward lowkey cuz everyone was staring at me but also like no shame in the game but anyways now I'm home I want to change I'm so tired I'm so tired day one exhausted me [Music] [Music] so know in my b hey [Music] good morning you guys um it is a browny day in Portugal it is their first full day and I woke up at 7:00 a.m. to try to get early get up in Adam yet I have only been taking photos of myself because this hotel is just so beautiful I I don't I don't even know what to tell you but today's a brand new day I'm honestly kind of starving so I kind of want to eat or get a coffee there was this breakfast place called deer breakfast that everyone goes to but I'm thinking for now that maybe there's more to the trip than just eating so we might get this traditional snack and I think it's called pastel but we're not going to have it just yet but we might we might I don't know okay so what I'm actually trying to do is go to balm I think they have like famous like pastries there and just like shopping and kind of like a cool Cool vibe there don't know how to get there yesterday I met this guy like walking on the street and he told me he would give me a free tour but I don't know if I trust myself as a solo female traveler going on a random tour with a single man I don't know but at the same time she would be spontaneous and take the win and potentially have a really great day I don't know but then do I have to hang out with them things that go through a girl's mind when she's by herself you know no hate to the man he was so sweet but looking out for my safety here anyways um I think my best beted is just getting dressed getting out of the house and seeing where we go from there don't know what I'm going to wear I feel like I didn't plan correctly to be honest I thought I was going to be like at the beach bathing sus all day I wasn't really planning for Lisbon okay I'm going to wear this dress this is what I'm going to end up wearing on my adventure I actually wore this dress in Paris but it was super rainy so technically no one got to see it we're going to rewear it it's fine [Music] [Music] okay you guys I got the pelata I think that's how you say and I got an iced coffee [Music] okay you ready for the taste test the coffee is decent there's no sugar in it so there's that I feel like I need to film the first impression for my [Music] friend M that's Epic [Music] guys not the Sad Piano I'm literally going to cry [Music] I don't really know what there is to do here so I'm going to look on my phone right now and look around but it's so beautiful here [Applause] [Music] okay I think I did everything I wanted to do while being here and now we're going to go to a new area we are leaving the balm section we saw a bunch of historical sites I know that they have really good bakeries here to get those B however you say it but I already had like two this morning so I don't want more which is kind of unfortunate cuz apparently they're really good here but I just booked my Uber and we're going to go to the LX Factory this was highly recommended for me as everyone told me that there was a lot of stores and a lot of shopping and restaurants I ended up walking around but didn't necessarily find anything I wanted to buy so I went to the timeout Market which is a market that has a whole bunch of different vendors of food and so many different Cuisines I ended up getting this Berry Pavlova as well as these little I don't even know what they're called I think they're like crocketts they're basically Savory pastry balls or rolls that are deep fried and often served at celebrations I had some with pork some with beef they were so good and I just sat in this park and just kind of hung out with myself didn't go on my phone just people watched it was such a beautiful day and I had such a good time here these are bomb and I should have got more I don't even really know what they [Music] are after I was done sitting for a while I decided to head back into the City and walk around and this is one of my favorite things to do when traveling alone I literally just Walk and Walk and Walk until I get tired or I get bored and I made sure to get a little matcha on the way so I would have a little bit of a power [Music] drink the city of Lisbon is so beautiful it is so colorful I swear just walking around for hours I did not get bored just because there was so much to look at [Music] okay guys I've been walking for way too long it's getting sus it's been like 11,000 steps so I think I'm going to call an Uber and just call it [Music] quits he you guys I'm finally back at my hotel thank God today was a walking day I did 15,000 steps and I am exhausted I'm exhausted but I stopped and I got a little Fanta and I got a cro Madam which I haven't had yet I don't know they keep being at Little Stores I don't know if I'm going to go out tonight it is a Monday so it's already kind of being a little bit more quiet of a night and I have a lot of work to catch up on which is honestly sad because I'm only here for a few days and I kind of wish that I could just keep exploring but it also is hard to do nightlife when you're alone not going to lie cuz I don't feel that safe you know partying on my own as for my impressions of lizin I've really been liking it it's very colorful very Lively I can kind of understand Portuguese not really at all but like it's kind of similar to Spanish so like some things are the same which is nice and I feel like any Spanish speaking country just resonates with me obviously not that they speak Spanish here but you know what I mean more than like Paris or something if you've watched all the travel videos in order you would have saw that I went to the UK first then France now here and it's kind of hard to compare all three of them cuz they're all so different so far I still think Paris is my favorite but I love Portugal I'm kind of upset that I'm only going to be in Lisbon and everyone's been telling me to go to Porto go to the South like go to all those beach towns and that's what I was originally supposed to do I don't know if I already explained this but I was going to do like a 2E trip to Portugal with my friends and go to a bunch of different places like they've literally been going everywhere but there was a little change of plans and I ended up just doing Lisbon by myself and so I feel like I missed out on a lot of really cool places that people recommended that my friends went to but that just means I'm going to have to visit again I'm going to eat this and just chill I'm so tired the next morning I started off my day by going to Deer breakfast this was a breakfast spot that was highly recommended in Lisbon and let me tell you though it was a little bit busy it was so delicious I ended up doing some work at this Cafe as well and then I went back into the city to just explore I found a whole bunch of thrift stores and this was so much fun I think one of my favorite things to do is find vintage stores in different countries [Music] I just did some thrifting did some walking around got one shirt later I made my way back to get some of these pastries they were so good and since they're so traditional to Lisbon I was like I need to get as many as I can before I leave I even did a little bit of shopping and then it was time to pack and get ready for the yoga [Music] retreat okay you guys sad as I am to say it it's time I leave Lisbon I'm actually going over to a yoga retreat now still in Portugal but a different area I'm actually not sure what it's called I'm going to put it up on the screen I had the best couple of days in Lisbon I kind of wish I could have stayed longer I'm like sweating though I lowkey like need to leave like why am I wet oh [Music] after lunch was done we got to walk around the resort and can you just look at how beautiful this place looks I was literally so excited just so happy so grateful and then I finally made my way into to the [Music] Villa hey guys first impression the amount of overwhelm I feel right now knowing that this is all for [Music] me oh my God okay you guys I've officially gotten to the yoga retreat I'm so excited I'm actually in a little bit of a rush right now because we're going to our first thing which is I think a mindfulness kind of activity so I'm just quickly getting ready and I'm going to grab some of the goodies that they gave me but I'm going to show you them so I kind of already messed up the bed but you guys how cute is this we're staying at the hotel octant and this message first of all is just so adorable I'm obsessed with this and I'm so excited for this trip other than that we got this little scroll we got a little yoga block a yoga mat a cute little hat and then this tote bag and it comes with a bunch of goodies we got some Swiss chocolate an aloe yoga yoga strap some aloe yoga socks which we might use right now and then some cute little mindfulness goodies so I'm just getting ready to do that now I don't know how much I'll be able to Vlog this trip I'm going to try my best to Showcase this beautiful hotel and also I want to film with Adrien because she's the yoga instructor that actually invited me and she's a good friend of mine [Music] so this was the first activity that we had which was a group meditation and yoga practice we all walked our way over to our destination and we did kind of like a silent meditation on the walk there so nobody spoke and we just absorbed the nature around us and let me just tell you the energy was so good oh my [Music] God once we sat down we began to roll out our mat our yoga blocks and we all got individual journals and we kind of had a little moment of silence and the instructor Adrien which is a dear friend of mine she went around and kind of spoke life into everyone and just kind of gave a little bit of an intro to the whole weekend this was such a heartwarming evening honestly I felt so present I felt so loved everybody had such good energy and I couldn't believe I was in such a beautiful place getting to do something that I've always wanted to do thanks for having me Randa she's like my little sister she's just amazing um we connected really through Alo and our like less Journeys and I was telling you about you earlier and

she has a own podcast her YouTube channel is like wow she's about to launch her own journal so next time we're on a retreat you're going to have hers and just such a light so I'm so grateful to [Music] as we were meditating I could feel the wind on my body and I was just so relaxed it even started to trickle rain a little bit but I wasn't even mad I wasn't even sad I honestly thought that it made the experience just so much better after the yoga practice was done we showered got ready and then made our way over to dinner I made some new friends and then at the very end we wrote down things we wanted to let go of and put our little papers into the fire people going to talk about what they bur can you push mine oh it's burning now it's going mine is burning burning wow no time to let go you guys are so beautiful to let go oh my gosh and remember how like there was no fire before you're manifesting that that's a part of the manifestation right so since you want to remove that from your body you write it down and then when you burn it the fire is very healing so a lot of [Music] okay you guys last night was so much fun just yesterday in general you guys saw the footage it

is the house that I was watching yesterday on YouTube and now it's here I kept smiling during my bus ride because I was so excited and everything is already so beautiful [Music] I sit down for a minute because I have this giant [Music] bag I'm going to eat because I'm [Music] starving okay I just finished eating and now I'm going to my hostel and I was just walking around and I just took a street and look at which one is Diagon I mean of course it's not diagonal but I wasn't expecting it to find it so soon everything is so close I just arrived in my hotel room this is going to be my bed I'm Mr Taco tickle Mr tickle and as you can see here so every bed has a name and they just give it to you and this is the view great view I say I'm pretty happy I'm just going to walk today I don't want to do anything in particular because I'm going to do that tomorrow with my new hat I'm ready to go I like it [Music] I am at the vanel steps and it just randomly started to rain luckily I have this hat so I'm well [Music] reped there are a beit too many people right now I think that right there there was a girl about to do a super cool photo shoot I'm actually very jealous but I love the houses here they're so cute small and they have their own little porch so cute [Music] [Music] bought a magnet uh it was really cute and I paid it even that [Music] much this is the most gorgeous ever so beautiful [Music] this makes everything more [Music] Scottish so this is mar car's court and here behind me there is the writer Museum I don't know if you can hear me actually and I was able to take some great photos because this is really really really pretty and the writer museum is that one right there I'm going to show you guys now it's raining a lot and I choose a place to eat way too far away I don't know why I thought it was a good idea because it's seemed good but I gra this very much well whatever at least I'm going to eat well hopefully okay guys I finished eating and it stopped raining so that's good and the place was really good I ate some really good ramen now I'm heading to the hore [Music] it's the next day and I W up at 700 since I take minutes to get ready and

tried to take some photos but this tripod is pretty useless yeah it just that's the bare minimum you can't even stand still so that's okay [Music] okay so I was able to take some picture also at the Vel steps and I was pretty lucky because there I found a few girls that offered to take a picture of me and so yeah I have many many [Music] many and now I am really going to the [Music] Milkman I have to decide where to go next and not sure [Music] now where are too many people inside so I had to stay [Music] outside I just finished eating and I'm a bit confused because I think that there are

LNsJ50LY75O2N2dmsFgroKfdmrY,Travelling Iran in 2025 is hard... here&#39;s why 🇮🇷,My thoughts on travelling Iran in 2025 More Content: ▻ Travel Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@LukeDamant ▻ BTS ...,Luke Damant Vlogs,2025-04-09T11:00:05Z,"{'default': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3yyTs0aYVS8/default.jpg', 'width': 120, 'height': 90}, 'medium': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3yyTs0aYVS8/mqdefault.jpg', 'width': 320, 'height': 180}, 'high': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3yyTs0aYVS8/hqdefault.jpg', 'width': 480, 'height': 360}}",,3yyTs0aYVS8,1908,107208,en,3yyTs0aYVS8,"Morning everybody from the beautiful city of Thran here in Iran. I'm running my morning errands. I feel like we're doing this every morning, getting money exchanged and doing a variety of other tasks. But I wanted to make this video to uh share some of the difficulties that I faced in traveling this country because out of all the countries I've been to, I think it's probably the most difficult due to the lack of information online, the lack of English, and that kind of stuff. So, there's a variety of points I want to talk about in this video as we run some errands. I'm on the way to find a coffee shop to get a little bit of caffeine in me. Uh but before we actually go into some of the points, one thing I've noticed which isn't a a difficulty, but everyone starts speaking to me in fy. Like out of all the countries I've been to, I've not had this many like interactions where I'm just like sitting on the curb and people I guess like asking for directions or something. I was just in a pharmacy getting some chapstick cuz it's so cold here. And uh like the lady started speaking to me in fy and then the guys outside wanted me to buy them food I think. Uh and I just don't really know how to respond. I'm like I don't speak your language. Anyways, let's try find a a coffee shop. Look at that beautiful mosque right there. Amazing. Here we go. This place looks like it sells coffee. Salam. How are you? You good? Can I get coffee, please? Latte. Um just latte is okay. Thank you. So, this is one thing, guys, is that there's no English uh here. I think I'm even looking at this the wrong way. So, you can use Google Translate and take a photo of this and kind of uh get the translation. I will actually do that just to show you guys. So, if you go on like Google Translate, take a photo of this, it actually is like super helpful when it actually works. Here we go. So, we got energy drink. I mean, sometimes it's not as accurate, but here we go. The drinks are hot chocolate. I don't know the numbers. What is it? 140 like$1 or2 US. So, you can do that in any country really. Oh, should we get a little chalky croissant, guys? I'm a for these. So, the money situation is going to be the main talking point of this video because it's very interesting. Thank you. And and can I get one of these, please? Chocolate croissant. Chocolate. Yeah, please. Thank you. Um here this one. Is this chocolate? Yes. Yes. Yeah. Add this one, please. Great. Thank you. Thank you. How much is it? 300. 300. Okay. Thank you. Let's take a seat over here. Can't really ask for many better backdrops, right? Look how beautiful that is. So, 300. Uh, this is where it gets confusing with the money situation. I'm starting to wrap my head around it, but they simplify a lot cuz there's so many zeros. Literally, the Iranian currency, I'll show you guys. This is um 1 million real, but on the new notes, they printed it down into hundreds. So, this is worth like $1. The current rate while I'm here is around $1 equals 900,000 real. So, this is around like like two bucks. All three three like just over $3. Let's try out the latte. I love being able to come to coffee shops like this and just observe. It's really cool, guys. So, before I uh go into what is the list that I have that I want to speak about, it's freezing in this country, guys. Alam another example of people speaking to me in fossy. Um it's 4° right now. Tomorrow I'm leaving Tan to go down to the south where it's beautiful weather. And when I'm leaving at what's the time at 7:00 a.m. It's -6, guys. I I I don't do well in cold climates. -6. That's scary. I've never been in that that level of temperature unless I'm specifically going on a ski holiday. But there's a few things I want to talk about in order of what I think makes the most sense here in Iran. Number one, I want to speak about is the visa situation. This is by far the hardest country I've had to get a visa. Not that it was like a super difficult process. It was just it was a very spontaneous trip. But supposedly depending on your nationality, right, there's basically like six or seven countries, the most notable countries being the US, England, and Canada, where you guys can't come to Iran without a guide. So, you have to be guided the whole time. So, luckily, as an Australian, I can go out and be just on my own without someone here. And that's why the whole trip is going to be solo. But if you're American, a Brit or a Canadian and a few other countries, unfortunately, you guys are going to have to get in contact with the tour guide. I will actually suggest I do have a friend here, Esan, who's a tour guide in Shiraz. And without him, I would be screwed in this country. He's been doing so many things like paying for things, obviously like communicating with me and translating things cuz the one difficulty that you'll find is that there is no way to book things. the country of Iran is like blocked off to the western world in terms like payment solutions and stuff because of the sanctions and Visa and Mastercard doesn't work. It's just a headache. So, a lot of the hotels that I booked on this trip have been through my friend Airson who my buddy Mac went on a big trip with and he's a cool guy. And what we're actually doing later on in this video is going to the money exchange to send him like a like $600 or $700 worth of Iranian Royale because he's booked a lot of the hotels for me. If you're any other nationality, you can get an e visa. Now, I was confused because it says that Australians can get a visa on arrival, but you still need a pre-authorization code. You still need to apply for the e visa and then once you get the e visa back, then you can land at the airport and do that. Now, I originally submitted this by myself, which you're allowed to do, and I just didn't hear back from anyone. Now I posted on Instagram about this and I heard from a follower that he also was in a similar situation waiting months for this e visa and he actually just like caught a flight from Turkey to Tabris I believe uh in like the what is it northwestern part of Iran and then just like they figured it out on the when he arrived like they were chill they got him the visa now I didn't really want to do that coming here I'd prefer to have it all sorted out so I use again my buddy son to uh get in contact with an agency here to uh apply for the visa. It took like 5 or 6 days. There's a few notable ones. Tap Persia is pretty popular and I used up Persia. Oh, that's if you want to get the visa. This is actually a damn good croissant. I took off the whole top bit. Oh, it's so flaky. Oh my goodness. Wow. If I can start my morning every day like this, this is how I do it. Making a mess of myself. Oh my god. So once you have the visa sorted, if you go through an agency, I have to supply my itinerary. Now, I wanted to keep this trip super open, so I'm like changing it and just like emailing them as I go, which they're probably not happy with, but um I think they have to inform some organization or some part of the government what my moves are. This is damn good. So, once you have the visa, well, you can now book your flights to Iran. Miraculously, not once, when I was checking into any of these flights to get here was I asked to show my visa, which is just like unheard of. Like, especially for a country that so clearly needs a visa. So, I didn't even need to have to show it. So, I was thinking if I never got the visa that I would just fly here. And I wasn't concerned about arriving here and being rejected, but I was concerned about the check-in staff not letting me board the flight because I didn't have an active visa. Anyways, that was just a concern I had. never had to follow through with that. I feel like we're going around in circles. But guys, also, there is one island in Iran that's a 50-minute flight from Dubai. They have daily flights. It's called Kish Island, which I'm going to be going to in about a week or so. And anyone can enter there for 14 days, visa-free, even Americans. So, you can go there and actually visit Iran. It's kind of like, it honestly reminds me a lot of like Dubai. It looks like very cool, very luxury, nice beaches and stuff like that. So you can actually still visit Iran if you go to Kish Island. K I S H. [Music] So that's an alternative if you can't get the visa. You're not going to experience like any of the culture or anything there, but it's a relatively new economic zone, but that's an option. I flew into Toronto airport. There's a separate park at immigration for the visa on arrival. And you go into this room. Now, it's also handy to note that whatever you put on your e visa, the amount of days that you're staying, you can stay up to 30. But whatever you put on your entry and exit date, you only get that many days. It's €165 for me. It depends on the the nationality as well. It changes. You can pay with dollars or euros there. You can't pay with bank card. But even though I paid the €165, I can only say the 14 days because that's originally what I put on my application. So even if you're here for just like one or two days, it's going to cost 165 bucks or basically the same. Or if you stay 30 days, which I believe is the current limit, then you're going to be paying 165. When I was getting my visa at the airport in Teran, the lady was super super kind. She actually been to like Canro in Australia, I think, uh as a as a diplomat. So they were super friendly. Like so the people here are so friendly. Like it's honestly crazy. Like they're they're so kind, so friendly, so helpful. Um, yeah, paid the the visa fee there and it actually comes with travel insurance because a lot of policies around the world don't cover countries like Iran because of the sanctions. So I if I get into an accident here or need to go to hospital, which is probably likely cuz I always end up in hospital, then uh my current travel insurance is not going to work here, but you actually get travel insurance with the e visa. Now, I didn't really know this until like a few days later. I got this random email. So, I got this random email here like 2 days after I entered the country. And this is the details. I'll put it up on screen and blur out any information, but the main things are the limit. I get €10,000 worth of care and the premium is $10 for €10. So, yeah, I guess if anything happens, then at least we got that covered, which is actually pretty good that they're they're doing this. But once I got the visa and arrival, I went through the immigration. He didn't really ask me any questions. Didn't have to show an exit flight. I didn't have to show an exit flight to anyone even though I had one booked. Like no one asked questions about this trip like they would. Like in Dubai, people are always asking, you know, when are you leaving the country or like show me your return ticket? Like I had all that, but no one even asked me for it, which is interesting. But that's basically the process of getting a visa and getting into the country. I'll put up any other information I've missed when we're editing this video. All right, I'm randomly thinking of things, guys. One other thing to note is that Iran is on the countries, one of seven countries, I believe, where if you visit, you're no longer allowed to get the ets to visit the USA. So, Iraq, I believe, uh Yemen, Iran, North Korea, and a few other ones. Cuba as well. If you visit these countries, you're no longer allowed to apply through the ETSA, and you have to go into the embassy, have an interview, and then get a 10-year visa to the United States of America. Now, it would be super easy for me to just apply online to the ETSA if I hadn't visited these countries, but they ask you specifically, have you been there? They ask like, why you've been there? And you're always going to get asked to have an extra interview. So, if you come here, you're no longer going to be allowed to visit the US with like uh the ETSA program, which is like the electronic travel uh authorization. But with that in mind, they don't actually stamp your passport here. So, I don't really know how they're going to figure it out. You guys can uh risk that if you want, but I'm already on that kind of ban because I went to Iraq in 2021. Um so, we're just kind of like playing Pokémon out here. We're just collecting them all. all the uh all the countries that the US hates. So that's another thing to note if you are coming here. There could be potential issues with that down the future. Let's finish up here. We'll go on to the next spot and I'll mention the second thing that I think is difficult about traveling here in Iran. Look how beautiful this is, guys. We got the call to prayer plane as well. Now, I'm not a woman if you can't already tell, so I'm not sure how to comment on the uh the situation of covering your head. Now, here I'd say like 50% of women are wearing a hijab. In some malls, there's signs saying it's required. As a tourist, like I'd say if you're a chick and you're here, just wear it. See what the vibe is. You just kind of don't want to draw attention to you. Uh so yeah, that's all I'm going to comment on that situation. But the second thing I want to talk about once you have your visa and you're in the country is booking hotels and booking flights cuz it's an absolute nightmare, guys. And that's why Essan has been so helpful in booking a lot of these things for me because due to the sanctions, a lot of booking websites that we know and use don't work. They don't even show the flights. You know, flights from Tan to Bandas where I'm going tomorrow. you look that up on Google flights, it doesn't even come up. There is no flights available. It goes through like Dubai or something when there's tons of direct flights. So, there's local websites here. I'm not going to act as if I know what my friend Esan is using to actually book these. But, I really would suggest finding someone here to book stuff because not only is it hard to book these things, but actually paying for them is like the next struggle because of the banking situation here and it being kind of cut off to the banking system that we use. Uh, back at home, Trip.com, because it's Chinese owned, has some uh, hotels available in Taran. I tried to book one and it needed like a 12-hour confirmation or something. It never came through, so I canled that. But yeah, like honestly, if I didn't have someone here booking these hotels, I'd be kind of screwed. So, Essan, if you're watching this, thank you so much for your help. I'll put his details below. He's a tour guide here in Iran, and he went on an epic trip with my buddy Mac all around the country. So, I'm sure if you guys are planning a trip here, uh, he can help you out. There's a diplomat office there and there's someone. Diplomat, please. All right. I'm not going to film that because, yeah, that's probably something else we should talk about. So, if you have a local contact here that can book your hotels, it's going to make a hell of a difference. I really just don't even know where to do it. So, I'm not even going to suggest anything to you. But the other thing I'll say is that if you don't know FYI, then you're screwed as well because all the confirmations come through Farsie. all the hotel bookings, none of it's in English, unless you're booking through an English platform, which is very unlikely because they're not going to be operating here due to the sanctions. So, my suggestion, get someone to book your hotels for you, and you can go to the money exchanges and send the money directly to their account, which we're on the way to do. So, you got your visa, you got your hotels booked. The next issue that you're likely going to face if you're coming to Tan, guys, is the traffic. So, how do you book taxis and bikes here in this country? Well, it took me a day to figure it out, and I'm glad I did figure it out because transport by bike is so much more efficient than cars in this crazy city. Tan is one of the most crazy cities when it comes to traffic. And I can only comment on this city cuz I've not been anywhere else. But from what I know, it's just Tehran. The other big cities and uh kind of islands are are usually pretty good. But there's an app called Snap that is basically the Uber here in Iran. So this is the Snap app, everybody. And you can order food, all kinds of things. It's literally just like Uber. It's actually kind of like the super Uber. You can get doctors, hotels. I didn't even know you could buy hotels here. That's kind of cool. Again, you can book stuff, but then the issue of paying it unless you're paying in cash is uh quite difficult. And usually they require deposits. But if you want to book something, just, you know, put where you are. It's pretty simple, put where you're going, and then you have the option of selecting a cab, a bike, or you can deliver stuff here. So, you do need an Iranian phone number to set this up. The app is also in English, though, so that helps. But, you're going to have to get a SIM card, get an Iranian phone number, and then you're able to use this. But, you can pay with cash. It's like a bike 440 real, like literally 50 cents to go like a few kilometers, which is cool. But if you can't do this for whatever reason, I found taxis and bikes are really hard to get off the street because there's a big language barrier uh as well as just there's actually just not many like taxis around. I feel like they're hard to hail down. When I did it by myself a few days ago, it was it was quite difficult and then explaining the whole process. So I highly suggest try and get snap as soon as you get here so that you can actually do this. Now that takes me on to the next point is if you are arriving to Thran airport, there's a bunch of scammers like like it's almost as bad as Delhi to be honest. But they're going to try and rip you off with SIM cards. They're going to try and rip you off with taxi rides and also going to rip you off with the dollar exchange rates. So there's a website that I'm going to put up. It's like a dodgy website showing what the like current kind of rate is for the real and there you can actually, you know, negotiate. You're going to get like a slightly lower rate. We're on our way to the the uh the exchange now to do all this. But yeah, they tried to pull the oh look at Google it's 40,000 real per US when in reality it's like 8 to 900,000. So if you exchange at the airport you're going to get a terrible rate. You need to come down to Tehran uh in kind of the city center. there's a whole street filled with people that are selling in the exchanges but then also on the street uh giving you sometimes a better rate. So in terms of the money situation guys, you have to bring in US dollars or euros or another big currency here. USD and euros are the best. Uh people are always going to accept them. Make sure they're bigger notes, you know, in reasonable condition, but there's specific parts around each city. Here in Tan, I'm about like 2 or 300 m away from where all the exchanges are. And you go in, you get the rate. As a if you don't speak far, you're probably going to get like a little bit of a less rate, but you can like negotiate. But you can also actually send money to Iranian accounts. So that's why we're going today to take around like $1,000 and hopefully they're going to be able to send it to my friend Assan who's down in Shiraz and I can pay him for all the accommodation that he's booked on this trip. So they don't like filming down there because it's kind of, you know, a bit of a underground kind of thing. So I'm going to walk there now, film when I can, but I'll give you guys an update afterwards. My goodness, guys. After literally an hour, an hour and a half in the exchange getting these payments done, son finally has his money. But I still need to actually exchange uh cash for or dollars for cash here. I didn't want to do it at the same place just to get a little bit more of an experience. It's always interesting meeting the hustlers on the street. So, I'm walking the opposite direction cuz I don't want to film in the area. But, uh yeah, that was a so difficult. Luckily, the guy there spoke decent English, but there's a lot of translation. And I had Assan on the phone. They sent part of the money and then didn't send the other part. And then they're using different banks and stuff. But Asan finally got his money. So I sent 860 US, which is 800 or around like 780 million Iranian real. I almost did my first billion dollar deal, guys. But it is crazy the numbers that they're using here in the millions. Like 780 million. Anyways, I'm going to go get $400 or $500 exchange on the street because the next little bit of the trip once we leave Tan is going to be uh not as accessible to get cash. Hormos Island where we're going next is literally an island that's like 3 or 4 km long. There's no exchanges there. And uh after that, there's a few other places that we're visiting, but there's not going to be many exchanges. So, I want to have cash on me ready to go. So, let's try and find someone else that will give us a good rate. We got 95 uh,000 real per US dollar in the end, but that was because we had to go through the bank transfers, me giving them cash. So, we should be able to get maybe like 910 if we do it on the street. But 9:05 will be the bare minimum. So, won't be able to film much of the process. But man, the banking and money system here is just not not working. It's it's so difficult. And there's the biggest difficulty traveling here in Iran for sure. Money changes. This is the where all the money people are. So, I can't film otherwise you're going to cause issues, but getting 910 uh for it. All right, guys. We're kind of out of the exchange area. I'm not going to hold my camera up too high because we're at a very secure building right now and I see a a police offic. So, yeah, we got all the money. Let's find an area to chill and then I can take you through the past hour or so. Snap. Snap. Yes. Yes. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay. So guys, as I said earlier, you can get snaps around. I wanted to film this part. So we got the German embassy here. Also the Irish embassy. They're super heavily secure. But it's always interesting seeing embassies around in countries that uh like you know have the media kind of against them. So guys as we go to the hotel to drop off our millions of real hundreds of millions actually I wanted to add why I'm making this video and that is the next difficulty in Iran is that there's not many people that have been here and done extensive I guess like how to travel here videos. And from the little bit of research that I did before here, I learned so much more with boots on the ground than any blog or any video can actually share. So that's why I wanted to make this to share my perspective and my kind of on the run thoughts of the past couple days here. So hopefully if anyone is actually coming to visit, you can use some of these things as advice. It's not that I ever would recommend using my advice. It is generally terrible, but it is helpful to know how certain things work. So, before coming here, there really was not much that I could look at. There were blog posts, there was some YouTube videos, but a lot of it has just been on the run, figuring it out along the way. Just like when I changed money, then didn't know how to transfer to a bank account. Figured it out. When I was getting cash, uh, he actually gave me like the old currencies. I need to look up whether the old currency is actually still in use. So, you kind of like learn these things and pick them up along the way. But, they're about to make it to the hotel. I'll show you guys my stacks of millions and then we'll add in my final thoughts of the trip so far here in Iran. Yeah, here's fine. Thank you so much. Thank you. Have a nice day. Yeah, you too. Yeah, you can keep this. It's okay. No change. Nice to meet you. So, that ride there, guys, was about 10 minutes and uh I gave him 1 million real, I think it was only like 700 on the app, but just like $1 to get around. It is very cheap here to actually travel. Um, but here we are staying at 101. And the room should have been nicely done up while I've been away. Smells good. Hell yeah. Nice fresh room. It is so cold. My nose is dripping like crazy. So guys, this is the cash that we got. 350 million real approximately. I think it was like 360 or something something like that. But this right here is worth $400, which is crazy. Now, one thing when traveling is you have to kind of adapt to situations. And I that's the beauty of traveling is that you're put in circumstances where you have to think on your feet, figure out the solutions to everything and become a problem solver. And there's going to be little things when you travel that test you and figure out and like just a very brief example is when I was given this money, I I hadn't seen the old bank notes. So I had to double check that these were still like legal tender. So you can see these ones 100 uh or 1 million real notes. There's the new ones that are these like blue ones are like kind of different, you know, they're like very new. So, I was like, ""Oh, well, you know, maybe they're not uh still used."" So, you have to like figure that out as you go. Um, I didn't count anything because I just trust the guy and I prefer to not have the uh like be counting anything out in public in that scenario. I think it's better just to trust the guy and they're usually, you know, wrapped up in 100 million kind of blocks and then you got the rest off like this. But we ended up getting 880 uh,000 per one US dollar because I had 50 USD notes. Now, when you're coming here and other countries that kind of are in like a similar situation like Myanmar, when I was there, sometimes they're very strict on the actual USD note condition. So, in Myanmar particularly, they would only accept 100 USD notes and they had to be in like pristine condition. They had to have the the blue stripe which was like the new note of the 100 USD bill. Now here they're not as strict on the notes, but obviously if you have smaller denominations, it's not as valuable. Even if you had 1001 US bills, you're not going to get the same price for one $100 bill just cuz it's not as valuable. So when you saw that I had 50s, the price changed to $880 uh versus the original 910 that was quoted. And you know, in those situations, sometimes I just would prefer not to be um conflictive or create any conflict. So, I was like, ""Yeah, whatever. I've been here standing here for like 10 minutes in the freezing cold. Let me get out of here."" But guys, look at the money that we got. This is crazy. Hello. This is the Bank of Iran speaking. Yes, I'd like a loan of $1 trillion, please. That's crazy. 300 USD and we have this kind of cash. But I wanted to wrap up with some final thoughts on this country and why I wanted to make this video. Because when I was coming here, I did a little bit of research. It was very uh spontaneous this trip and it was only like a few days notice and I couldn't research like as much as possible. But from the brief research that I did, there was such little information online and it's constantly changing as well. There were a few blog posts. There are a few YouTube videos. But I've learned so much with boots on the ground here and actually like experiencing these things that I just thought that it'd be useful for anyone coming here and anyone wanting to know what the reality is of me being here at the mo at this point in time and the situations that we face just as like travelers. So, I hope this is helpful. I wouldn't say take my advice because it's probably terrible advice, but you can take my experience and see what I've shown in this video and how you guys can do it if you are like traveling here in the future. But this place is amazing. Like Tehran such a vibe. The people are so friendly here. The Iranian Persian hospitality like I met so many nice people. the the English is is lacking which is an issue especially when you need like kind of in-depth like English or FYI to like do like transactions like this or like when you're talking big numbers. So that has been a difficulty. But when you come across someone that speaks English or even if they speak a little bit of English, they're just so friendly. So it's been such a nice experience being here. But the other thing I just wanted to mention is I felt like very safe in Tetron. I would say that probably because it's the biggest city, it's probably the most unsafe with like crime and stuff. I'm just saying that I don't actually know. But I've walked around at night and the only thing that has been an issue is the cold. Like there's been times where my my fingers are like literally freezing. I can't feel my fingers. But I felt very safe at night. I felt safe walking around. I've never felt like in danger or anything. And just I don't know. I kind of like blend in. It's like when I was in Afghanistan, I just like especially with the local attire there. I was just blending in. People thought I was Afghan because of the diversity of the country. But here as well, like they don't dress um you know in that kind of conservative uh traditional dress. There's people that are looking very like stylish and stuff. So even just what I'm wearing now with like a bum bag with all my cash in it. Like I blend in and people are coming up to me speaking fast. I'm like, ""Bro, I have no idea what you're saying. I wish I could help but I can't."" Um and that's like the first time that's happened extensively in any country uh here in Iran. So I hope this video was somewhat useful for anyone coming here. As I mentioned, basically the premise of this video is that to make things easier in this country, you need to have a local contact. And there's tons of people that I've been speaking to on Instagram. There's tons of people that reached out when I said that I was doing this trip. And there's people that you can meet on like Facebook pages and stuff. Um, it's not my fault if you get kidnapped by meeting people on Facebook pages. That's your fault. But the number one thing I'd say is if you want to make this trip as smooth as possible is to have a local contact here. because my friend Essan, even though I've not met him, he has been so much help just getting things booked and translating things. Like, it's just a timesaver. Like, I only have two or so weeks here and I don't want to spend like a whole day just figuring out how to book on these random travel payment agencies. So, for me, it's like actually like time saving that I can actually use exploring parts of the country rather than spending a whole day figuring out how to book all these things, how to make the payments and stuff. So, um, obviously that is part of the travel experience. Like I love rocking up to a country with nothing planned and just rocking up to hotels. But if you are like trying to, you know, have a kind of easier process so you can enjoy more of the culture rather than sitting on your laptop booking things, then I'd suggest like getting in contact with someone here. And Esan, great guy. On my next trip to Iran when I do the big cities, when it's better weather, not cold like this, I'm going to be meeting him in uh in Shiraz where he is from. But these are the difficulties of traveling Iran in 2025. Everybody, hopefully you enjoyed. See you in the next video.",1,The video transcript primarily consists of the traveler's personal experiences and logistical challenges faced while traveling in Iran.

[Music] this so everything you saw was shot completely handheld using a phone and in this video I'm going to show you exactly how it was done this video is part one where I show you how to capture all of your shots and in part two we're going to dive into the editing and I'll show you how to edit all of these shots into a short cinematic sequence a big thanks to epidemic sound for sponsoring this video this is where I'll be going to get all of my music and sound effects for the final edit now let's head to our first location and start shooting some footage okay so if you haven't guessed by now I'm in London today but of course you can shoot your travel video wherever you like but what is really important is that you at least have some kind of plan that way you're not just shooting countless hours worth of footage because that's going to be a complete nightmare to edit so to simplify today's shoot we're going to be breaking it down into five simple steps and step number five is really important so do make sure you watch to the end and tip number one is to celebrate your location okay but what do I mean by I celebrate your location well I mean focus on things that make your location unique every place will have a different style different character landmarks that make it instantly recognizable take London for example we've got red double-decker buses black cabs Big Ben red foam boxes everything about these details screams London so let's capture shots that reflect all this so that the viewer knows exactly where we are if I'm capturing a shot of Big Ben from Westminster bridge for example I could just film a white truck in the foreground driving by like this but this truck isn't particularly unique so instead if I just wait a few more seconds and capture the exact same shot again only this time with a red double decker bus in the foreground we now have a much more unique [Music] shot now if you were in Paris you'd approach it in the exact same way the eiel tower the cafe culture bonger and patisseries by celebrating these elements your film becomes a tribute to that place itself also think about anything El that adds a unique touch to your location It's Autumn here in London right now so I'm going to take advantage of the seasonal colors by using these leaves as foreground for this shot of Big Ben this will not only help make the shot look more unique but also add another layer of Interest you'll notice I'm using foreground in a lot of these shots today this is what will give your shots depth and is key to preventing your shots from looking flat and boring try to think about your shots in layers take this statue for example example not much depth to this shot it's flat and boring but if I simply move to the right and capture the same shot again only this time with these trees in the background we've now added depth and layers to this shot to make it much more interesting now it is a very overcast day today which is creating a really nice soft diffused light but there's not a lot of color ideally I'd like to see some light shining through these autumnal leaves but this is England we don't get a lot of sun so I'm just going to embrace what we've got okay tip number two camera movement camera movement is essential for adding energy to your shots so here are a couple of easy techniques to try out on your next shoot the first is to Simply push forward take this shot of tower bridge for example yeah not great now here's that exact same shot again only this time pushing forward two hands on the phone for this the more points of contact you have on the phone the smoother your shot will be and by simply pushing forward we now have a much more professional looking shot here's another example only this time on the bridge here we have a static shot now let's capture the exact same shot again only now pushing forward now another technique for added camera movement is to follow the action for this choose a focal point fast moving Vehicles work well for this lock focus and exposure and follow the action keeping your focal point in the center of frame these shots are a great way of giving your travel films more pace and really help put your audience deep in the action the opposite of this of course is not following the action and letting Vehicles pass through the frame like this still a time and a place for this but if you're looking to add more movement to your travel videos follow the action now if there aren't any vehicles at your location then another great focal point for this technique is birds birds add energy and Life to your shots the problem however is that birds are really difficult to film in fact out of everything that I've been shooting today birds are by far the hardest because you never really know where they're going to be what direction they're going to fly there's a lot of luck involved when it comes to filming Birds I did however get lucky whilst I was next to Tower Bridge as somebody dropped their baguette and there was a bit of a Feeding Frenzy nice also whilst we're on the subject of movement and adding life to your shots then be sure to capture some shots of flags whilst you're on your travels flags are a great way of instantly letting your audience know where you are let me just show you what difference adding movement to your shots can make here is a shot at Buckingham Palace of the British flag with no wind there is nothing more sad than a flag with no wind this is about as lifeless as it gets compared to say this shot here of a flag at the top of Westminster palace with lots of wind adding so much more life and movement flags are a great focal point to sprinkle into your travel films and also offer a great opportunity to add some sound design okay tip number three keep your Clips short now as you saw from the opening sequence none of those shots hold for long just a couple of seconds so you don't need to shoot long Clips keep them short 5 10 seconds Max short clips will keep the energy High keep your audience engaged and give you more variety to play with during the edit a classic beginner mistake is to assume that you need long shots to fully capture a scene but short clips actually make the final video more engaging because you're now capturing different angles and details of a location without it dragging on keeping your clip short also makes it easier to show the highlights of a place without over helming your audience and when you go to the edit you'll have more flexibility and can mix in different scenes quickly think of it this way each clip should feel like a snapshot of that experience focusing on one key focal point if you capture your trip in quick memorable Snippets you'll end up with a final video that's not only professional but also keeps your viewers excited from start to finish so remember quality over quantity now quick little bonus tip here for those of you that find yourself always running out of battery whilst you're on a show and that is to invest in one of these this is a portable power bank now because I've got an iPhone and mag safe this one here magnetically connects to the back of the phone so I can be shooting whilst charging my phone at the same time and this will give me at least a couple more charges because if you're out on a shoot shooting video on your phone all day it's going to absolutely spank your battery and having a portable power bank like this will avoid you having to go to a coffee shop and plugging your phone into a wall okay tip number four creative transitions think of these as the secret source to a cinematic edit but to make them work seamlessly you'll need to think about transitions while you're filming not just in the edit so here are two simple but effective techniques the first is to shoot your own unique transitions these are great for sprinkling into your travel films for this I'm going to go somewhere busy with lots going on Picadilly circus will do nicely and I'm simply going to capture a shot quickly panning from left to right right to left you can also do this going up and down and I'm going to do this multiple times so that I capture a shot that looks like this yes it looks like a complete mess I know but this is exactly what we're looking for because we're going to use small Snippets of this shot to help us transition from one clip to another for example if we wanted to transition from this clip of Trafalga Square we could just use a simple straight cut like this this is okay not too bad but now let's add our own unique transition between these two clips we only need a split second maybe five or six frames and we now have this these custom transitions are much more creative than any standard transition built into your editing software so a great way of giving your travel films a more unique look as well as movement now another technique is the whip pan this is similar to following the action only this time we're going to whip into the shot and then follow our subject or focal point bikes cars anything moving fast works for this we can then use these shots to help transition from one shot to another also this technique really lends itself well to adding sound design for example if we add a soft layer of Music a whoo sound effect and a bell we now have [Music] this now I don't want to dive too deep into the editing side of things because we're going to save that for part two but as you can see as soon as you start to add music and sound effects to these clips they really come to life now if you're making a travel film then by far one of the most important elements to help keep it engaging is music and sound effects because if you're shooting using your smartphone then chances are your audio is probably going to sound pretty terrible so having a professional Archive of music and sound effects to delve into is massively going to help and one of the best places for this is epidemic sound for example let's say I've got three shots within a sequence a flag some birds and a bus here is the original sound yeah not great now here are those exact same three shots again only this time with music and sound [Music] effects now don't worry in part two we will be delving into exactly how to edit your shots to music and sound effects but until then at least start to think about what sounds will work well with your travel film The Beauty of epidemic sound is that they have a really good mix of professional sounding music none of that cheap crap that can really kill kill the professional feel of your travel video so whether this is a soft cinematic piano a fast-paced orchestral piece or a sound effect like a riser or whoh epidemic sand has everything you need I've literally been using them for years they are one of the best places to get music and sound effects for your videos if you haven't given them a try yet then make sure you do I will put a link to a free 30-day trial in the description below okay now moving on tip number five one of if not the most important tip yet and that is people when shooting a travel video make sure that there are people in your shots adding people into the frame adds that human element making the film feel more real relatable and engaging if you're traveling with a friend then ask them to be in your video or even better than that find some locals and ask them to be in your travel film I saw this old war veteran wearing a bright red jacket collecting for the poppy appeal whil at Trafalga Square so I asked him to be in my video and he said yes just as long as I bought a poppy which of course I did for the sake of a small donation I captured this great portrait of a legendary local for my travel film I even got a salute now do get used to rejection because not everybody will want to be in your travel film I approached this police officer and asked him if I could capture some shots and he respectfully declined I can't stop you I would prefer if you didn't that's okay no worries but persistence pays because I spoke to these two police officers and they were more than happy to be included in my travel film also you don't need to capture port traits like this this is more of a stylized approach just make sure that people are in your shots it adds personality it makes the viewer feel like they're right there with you experiencing the location firsthand for example take this shot here of the London Eye and red phone boxes it looks okay but lacks movement and life so I'm going to get my phone a little lower to the ground and wait for some bikes to pass giving this shot much more Life Energy and movement also I can use that movement to creatively take my audience from one shot to another take these shots here for example most would assume that these are unusable and the shot is ruined but we can use these people to our advantage helping us transition from One Clip to the next now you could just keep things simple and use these wipes as a quick transition or go a bit more advanced and mask around people for a much more creative approach either way be sure to capture plenty of shots of people to help bring your travel films to life okay so with those five tips you should be now ready to go out and shoot your own travel film using just your smartphone in part two I'm going to show you exactly how to edit all of those shots into a short cinematic sequence with music sound design and creative Transitions and if you're watching this in the future you can
